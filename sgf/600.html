  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then</span><span> a loud bang</span><span> cut through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Lance and Aresta, who were locked in fierce combat, were both sent flying backward. They coughed up blood in mid-air before crashing heavily to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone gasped in shock, their eyes fixed on the two fallen warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get up! Get up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst the anxious cries of the Augustine family members, it was Aresta who managed to rise to his feet first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His physical resilience was far superior to Lance's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lance had only been able to hold his own against Aresta due to his powerful mind control abilities. Now, both were injured, but Aresta recover</span><span>ed</span><span> </span><span>much</span><span> faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though blood trickled from the corner of his mouth, Aresta looked at Lance with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lance, you've lost!</span><span> </span><span>You indeed have the potential to become Yalyna's Godson, but you're not yet strong enough to surpass my ranking!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lance struggled to get up, but after several attempts, he failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were filled with frustration and unwillingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had given it his all, but he had fallen just short. If only he had been a little bit stronger, he could have defeated Aresta and turned the tide of the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, that tiny gap proved to be an insurmountable chasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still had other tricks up his sleeve, but he knew that if his primary mind control abilities couldn't overcome Aresta, his other skills would be even less practical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth and admitted, "</span><span>Fine</span><span>!</span><span> You defeated me. </span><span>But you've been severely injured by me, and you'll lose your next match as well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aresta chuckled softly, "Next match? Does </span><span>the</span><span> Augustine family even have anyone left to fight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lance's face turned pale at those words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen, Emma, Sam, and he had all failed. On the Yalynch Rosenthal family's side, including Aresta, there were still four people left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their side still had two spots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no one else in the Augustine family could stand against Yalynch's Godson</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed they had already lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lance's face was grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The expressions of the Augustine family members were also </span><span>darkened</span><span> at this moment, their hearts filled with unwillingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today was Godfather's eightieth birthday banquet</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, on such an occasion, the younger generation of the Augustine family was defeated by Yalynch's Rosenthal family. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If word got out, it would be a massive blow to the Augustine family's reputation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was </span><span>defeted</span><span>, but there was nothing they could do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aresta sneered at the Augustine family members and said indifferently, "You still have two spots left. Hurry up and come out, don't waste time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, you've already lost. If you really don't have any talent left, you can just send anyone out to complete the process."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, the Rosenthal family members all let out mocking laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family members glared at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? The Augustine family really has no talent left? Not even daring to fight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha, how ridiculous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And they dare to call themselves the first ancient family of Rosmandi? They dare to compare themselves to our Rosenthal family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>How</span><span> weak!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Aresta was severely injured, he was incredibly arrogant at this moment, practically pointing at the noses of the Augustine family members and taunting them, instantly making them furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll fight you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, a figure stood up in anger. He was a young man from the Augustine family's main bloodline, around thirty years old. His aura was not weak, having reached at least Class A+.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Maxwell Augustine!</span><span> </span><span>Maxwell is second only to Vincent, Matthew, Emma, and Owen among the younger generation of the main bloodline. Unfortunately, he hasn't reached Class AA yet. He has no chance of winning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone couldn't help but say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Maxwell had already stepped onto the ring, staring at Aresta with anger in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the Augustine family! You can't act so arrogant here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, I, Maxwell, will defeat you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Maxwell attacked directly, not wanting to give Aresta a chance to recover. He summoned a sea of flames</span><span> which</span><span> instantly engulfing Aresta.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aresta didn't dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A look of joy appeared on Maxwell's face. He didn't expect Aresta's injuries to be so severe that he couldn't even dodge his attack. The hope of winning ignited within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that moment, Aresta's figure suddenly burst out of the flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He threw a straight punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Maxwell had tried his best to defend, he couldn't withstand Aresta's terrifying power. He was sent flying, crashing heavily to the ground, unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was defeated with one punch</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family members were all exclaiming in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aresta was clearly heavily injured, yet he could still easily defeat a Class A+ like Maxwell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wondered if the Augustine family still had a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Vincent, Matthew, and Emma's faces were all extremely unsightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They wished they could step onto the ring and teach Aresta a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aresta smiled faintly, "Loser! </span><span>You&rsquo;re n</span><span>ot even Class AA, and you dare to attack me? Even if I'm heavily injured, I can easily beat ten Class A+!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he arrogantly scanned the Augustine family members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does anyone from the Augustine family dare to step forward? If no one does, then just admit defeat!</span><span> </span><span>You're going to lose anyway!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aresta's words filled the Augustines with rage, but they had no way to refute them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Matthew sighed and stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Matthew rise, Aresta's expression changed. She said coldly, "Don't tell me you're going to fight? Hmph, you're too old! You're not qualified!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Matthew looked at Aresta calmly and said, "Don't worry, I won't fight you. Even if the Augustines lose, we won't break the rules.</span><span> </span><span>I'm just going to the dungeon to find you an opponent..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
