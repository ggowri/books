  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Harry and Amelia spoke, anger and frustration etched across their faces, and the gravity of their words hung in the air like a storm cloud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne opened his mouth, sensing that the next part of the story would forever alter the fate of </span><span>Celestara</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry continued, his voice thick with emotion, "A powerful </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> found Lord Malevolence! By that time, Lord Malevolence had been sealed away by the Seven Great Deity Kings for over a hundred years. He was incredibly weakened, and breaking free from that seal seemed nearly impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If things had continued as they were, he might have eventually perished in that prison. But then the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> came along."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These creatures, they don't have much intelligence. They attack any living being they can find, and the stronger the target, the more they're drawn to it. Lord Malevolence, even in his weakened state, was like the juiciest steak to them. They couldn't resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> launched their assault on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their first step was to shatter the seals placed by the Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Over the course of a century, countless </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> threw themselves against the barriers, and eventually, they succeeded in breaking the seal that held Lord Malevolence captive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just when they thought they could feast on Lord Malevolence's power, he seized the opportunity to escape!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The moment he broke free, everything changed for </span><span>Celestara</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Dark Deity Legion emerged almost immediately, and they were far too powerful for humanity, which was still recovering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whole communities were wiped out in the blink of an eye, and we were left scrambling for survival. People were either slaughtered or forced into hiding, trying to resist the overwhelming might of the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But then, something unexpected happened&mdash;the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> grew even stronger. Out of nowhere, a group of exceptionally powerful individuals emerged among them, some even rivaling the Deity Overlords and Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The rise of these formidable </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> shifted the balance. They became a threat to the Dark Deity Legion itself. Faced with this new reality, the Legion stopped their outright slaughter of humanity. Instead, they turned to enslavement and control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it weren't for that, we would have been wiped off the map long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right now, the Dark Deity Legion and the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> are the two dominant forces. The </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> roam the wilderness, while the Dark Deity Legion controls the cities </span><span>and mining areas. We, the ordinary humans, are left to scrape by in the cracks, just trying to survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Some of the more powerful deities have banded together to form a resistance, but their situation is dire. They face constant attacks, and if they're discovered, they're overwhelmed in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for us regular folks, venturing into the wild is a death sentence. We'd just end up as </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> fodder. It's better to endure the hardships of servitude under the Dark Deity Legion. Sure, it's tough work mining, but at least we're still alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Harry and Amelia fell silent, their heads bowed over their meals, a heavy gloom enveloped them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weight of despair hung thick in the air, and it was clear to Osborne that they felt hopeless about humanity's future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the rulers of </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, humans now struggled just to survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming might of Lord Malevolence's Dark Deity Legion and the relentless </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> far surpassed their own strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reclaiming dominion over the </span><span>Celestara</span><span> seemed practically unattainable for humanity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if the Seven Great Deity Kings return, it wouldn't change anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia broke the silence, her voice steady but tinged with urgency. "Alright, Osborne, you need to focus on healing. My brother and I have to head to the mines. In just seven days, we need to deliver our quota of Essence Crystals, and right now, we're nowhere near what we need."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she handed Osborne a milky-white crystal, its surface shimmering softly in the dim light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here, take this. It's a low-grade Essence Crystal. It'll help speed up your recovery."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne accepted the crystal, his expression serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Harry and Amelia's accounts, he grasped the harsh reality facing humanity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could only survive in the shadows, either enslaved by the Dark Deity Legion, forced to toil in the mines for their meager chance at life, or hiding in the wilderness, constantly at risk of being hunted down by the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> or discovered by the Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a grim existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Harry and Amelia, and in their eyes, he saw a mix of numbness and resignation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Numbness?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Resignation?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed most of </span><span>Celestara's</span><span> people had succumbed to that fate. But not him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wouldn't accept it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had come to </span><span>Celestara</span><span> not to be enslaved by the Dark Deity Legion nor to dig for their precious Essence Crystals. That was a fate he could not bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, as he sat there nursing his wounds, he realized he was too weak to change anything right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, "First things first, I need to survive, heal up, and grow stronger. Then </span><span>I'll find a way to join the human resistance. I can't stay here forever."</span></p><div class="pagination">
