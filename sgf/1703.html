From this moment on, you will oversee the transformation of the 400 thousand warriors at Divine Peak Nine base into my Blood Clan descendants. As the highest leaders here, this task falls to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, a surge of blood energy emanated from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Transforming 400 thousand people into Blood Clan members would require a massive amount of blood essence, and Osborne felt a shiver run down his spine as he calculated the cost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To convert all those warriors, he would have to sacrifice at least a third of his own blood essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After such a significant expenditure, he could already feel his strength waning</span><span> and </span><span>fatigue creeping into his bones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A frown crossed his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who would have thought that the biggest hurdle to creating more Blood Clan descendants would be a lack of blood essence? My limit for transforming 500 hundred thousand individuals is nearly reached! For a while, my power will take a hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'll need at least a month to recover my blood essence. If I lose too much without a chance to restore it, it could damage my foundation, impacting my potential and lifespan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's a trade-off I can't afford."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He distributed the blood essence to Angelo, Chandler, Arnold, and Mariah</span><span> and </span><span>instruct</span><span>ed</span><span> them to find a way to infuse it into every warrior at Divine Peak Nine base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given his current strength, anyone who integrated his blood essence would undoubtedly become a member of the Blood Clan, with no chance of resistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the shortage of blood essence is a real bottleneck in my plans! I had hoped to swiftly transform the two million soldiers of the Ninth Dark Deity Legion into Blood Clan members, </span><span>who </span><span>all obey my commands. I even dreamed of converting hundreds of millions from the various factions in East Zone Nine in the same manner!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this rate, even if there were no obstacles, transforming the Ninth Dark Deity Legion would take at least four months. As for the other factions? Forget it; I simply don't have enough blood essence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned</span><span> and </span><span>realiz</span><span>ed</span><span> that the lack of blood essence was an unforeseen complication.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "It seems I'll need to adjust my plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of Blood Clan descendants isn't the only factor that matters! A hundred </span><span>Transcendent Deity Blood Clan descendants are no match for a single Celestial Deity descendant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Likewise, a hundred Deity Overlord descendants can't hold a candle to one Deity King descendant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, from now on, only true geniuses and elites will be worthy of becoming my Blood Clan descendants!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My blood essence can recover, but it will affect my potential! Having enough Blood Clan descendants is important, but I won't sacrifice my talent and potential for sheer numbers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this realization, Osborne felt a sense of relief wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still, I must ensure that all 400 thousand warriors at the Divine Peak Nine base are transformed into Blood Clan descendants!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hand</span><span> and </span><span>signa</span><span>led</span><span> Angelo, Chandler, Arnold, and Mariah to leave and carry out his orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four of them set off with Osborne's blood essence, heading back to the Divine Peak Nine base. They had a variety of methods in mind to ensure that their subordinates would merge with Osborne's blood and be forcibly transformed into Blood Clan descendants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given their speed, it wouldn't take long</span><span>, </span><span>just a few days</span><span>, </span><span>and everyone at Divine Peak Nine base would be turned into Osborne's Blood Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There would be no need for Osborne to get his hands dirty; he could simply wait a few days at the base before heading back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne returned to his quarters within the base, settling into his stone room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Divine Peak Nine was undergoing drastic changes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon his return to the base, Angelo promptly convened an urgent meeting</span><span> and </span><span>summon</span><span>ed</span><span> all high-ranking officers of the Wild Flame Army, specifically those holding the rank of chiliarch and above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the cover of the divine power shield, he used his Deity King strength to subdue everyone</span><span> and </span><span>forc</span><span>ed</span><span> them to merge with Osborne's blood essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, every chiliarch and higher rank in the Wild Flame Army had been transformed into Blood Clan members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he directed these newly minted Blood Clan warriors to assist in converting the centurions, squad leaders, and even the ordinary soldiers of the Wild Flame Army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Chandler, Arnold, and Mariah were executing similar strategies. Though their methods varied, the outcome remained the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Deity King warriors, their power was overwhelming</span><span> and </span><span>le</span><span>ft</span><span> no room for resistance among the ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this way, the 400 thousand inhabitants within the base were rapidly being transformed into Blood Clan descendants.</span></p><div class="pagination">
