  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A female contestant said, "Brenda, I&rsquo;m willing to follow your orders! I believe you&rsquo;ll make the right decisions and judgments to lead us to survive."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A male contestant echoed, "That's right. We're all willing to follow your orders. Go ahead and give the command."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another female contestant said, "We can't go on like this. Right now, many of the native creatures of Abyssal Planet haven't arrived yet, but we're already struggling to hold on. Without unified command and if we don't unite soon, we won't even need the Magma Devourer to catch up&mdash;we'll all die here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another male contestant shouted, "I don't want to die, so I'm willing to follow your command."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, many people agreed to follow Brenda's orders. Just as Osborne predicted, the only ones who could convince the contestants were Valentino and Brenda, as they had the strongest power and background.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two of them are the most likely to win the championship. Even though the other contestants are very proud, they have to admit there is a significant gap between their abilities and those of Brenda and Valentino.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Valentino is dead. Only Brenda has the ability to unite everyone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, Brenda just displayed terrifying strength. She instantly killed a swarm of moths and bees. She also used a ring, an extremely powerful Defensive Sacred Artifact, to protect them all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They don't have such strength, so now they can only rely on Brenda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if some people are still unconvinced, they won't openly oppose Brenda at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda coldly looked at everyone and said, "Good! Since no one has objections, from now on, I am the captain of this team. Everyone must follow my orders. If anyone disobeys, don't blame me for being ruthless."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, those good at defense, stand over here! Those good at attack, stand over here! Those who can heal, stand over here!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda quickly got into action, started commanding, and soon divided the chaotic crowd into several different groups.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She shouted, "The defense group is responsible for guarding the perimeter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Attack group, don't hold back on Sacred Power. You must eliminate enemies as quickly as possible to ease the pressure on the defense group. Otherwise, if the defense group falls, you'll be the first to die.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The healing group must conserve Sacred Power to treat the injured and poisoned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The mobile group needs to react quickly. If you see any area struggling, step in immediately to help.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The scouting group needs to report the enemy's situation promptly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hundreds of participants were quickly assigned their tasks by Brenda. The once chaotic team instantly formed a formation, and each group finally began to cooperate with one another.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Brenda's arrangements, everyone trusted her more and focused on doing their own tasks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda said, "Now, you need to follow me and fight our way out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This desert area isn't suitable for defense. We need to leave here and head north. With the help of the northern glaciers, defending will be much easier."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After giving the order, Brenda suddenly put away the ring.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The defense shield vanished instantly. The surrounding native creatures immediately went berserk and swarmed them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, the contestants were completely different.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The defense team quickly used various Defensive Sacred Artifacts to block numerous attacks. The attack team unleashed their full power, harvesting the lives of the native creatures.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The scouting team discovered Abyssal Snake and Bloody Ivy lurking in the desert and immediately alerted the others to avoid ambushes and eliminate them early.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone performed their duties, unleashing incredibly powerful combat strength. Each of them, having stood out on the battlefield of the zone duel, undoubtedly possessed top-tier abilities. Every single one of them was a prodigy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, hundreds of people joined forces and quickly cleared out the surrounding Abyssal Snakes, Bloody Ivies, moths, and bees.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hundreds of contestants, like a spear, swiftly broke through the encirclement under Brenda's lead and advanced toward the northern glacier region.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the distance, Osborne and the other two did not show themselves but saw everything clearly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but feel a bit surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This woman is not simple. She managed to unite all the contestants so easily, truly impressive. Even if I stepped in, I couldn't have done this well&mdash;at most, I could save a few more people with my own strength," Osborne murmured. He had to admit that Brenda's leadership skills were stronger than his.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy and Clara both nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara said, "Yes, this woman is amazing. The contestants have been in chaos for so long, just focused on escaping, and no one could unite them. But she easily brought everyone together."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, they looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy said with a smile, "But we think you're even more impressive."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne touched his nose. "Are you deliberately flattering me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy shook their heads. "We're serious."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy asked, "What should we do next? Should we join the contestants' team?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy were waiting for Osborne to make a decision.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head. "Although I admit Brenda is impressive, I don't want to be directed by anyone. I can't take the leadership from her. Even if I did, I couldn't do better. So, let's not join the team. We'll act on our own."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy both nodded, as if they had already anticipated Osborne would do this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Osborne didn't show it, they could all sense his pride. No matter how strong Brenda was, Osborne would never willingly be directed by her or become her subordinate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara asked, "So what do we do? Should we follow the team?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head. "If we follow the team, wouldn't we just be taking advantage of them? If someone finds out, they'll think we don't want to contribute and only want to freeload."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides, if we follow them, all the native creatures will be killed by them. In that case, how will we earn Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> and achieve good results?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a pause, Osborne smiled and said, "Let's act on both sides of them. Those native creatures are attacking them. We can help take out some of the creatures in advance. That way, we're helping to ease their pressure."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Maybe this is a good opportunity. Normally, zone duel doesn't allow teaming up. But in this situation, even if we team up, the judges won't say anything. I might be able to get both of you into the top ten of the zone </span><span>duel</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Clara and Leroy both became excited. "Really?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "Let's give it a try. Normally, there wouldn't be so many native creatures gathered for us to kill. In that case, it would be hard to earn Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>. But now, as long as we're strong enough, the more native creatures we kill, the more Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> we'll get. What if we succeed?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne scanned the surroundings with Satan's Eye. Seeing a group of moths quickly approaching the participants' team on the left, he immediately became excited. "Flash, let's head over there."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Those are </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moths. The wings of an </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moth can be exchanged for three thousand Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>. Each </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moth has four wings, which equals twelve thousand Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There are at least a few hundred </span><span>Eaglebeak</span><span> Moths over there. Let's go kill them all."</span></p><div class="pagination">
