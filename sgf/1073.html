  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just over a week ago, Osborne had brought Clarissa to him, hoping he could guide her through the breakthrough to Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, it was a piece of cake, so he readily agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>True to his expectations, under his guidance, Clarissa successfully broke through to Class AAA in less than five days. But it was right after that when things took a turn for the unexpected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa hadn't awakened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, the God of Star didn't think much of it. He could sense that Clarissa was undergoing some sort of transformation, and the fate power within her was rapidly increasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like good news for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as time went on, the intensity of this transformation escalated. Clarissa, who had just broken through to Class AAA, was now pushing toward Class S. That was when the God of Star began to realize something was seriously off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Breaking through to Class S is a good thing. But the fate power inside her is just too overwhelming! What on earth is her background? How can she possess such potent fate power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And to think that such a powerful force is locked away within her flesh and blood... That's not right! It could seriously harm her body! She needs to find a way to release that fate power...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh, forget it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can barely hold on myself, so worrying about this won't help! I just hope Osborne gets back soon, or we're really in trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the God of Star shifted his focus away from Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder if everyone has made it out yet? Let me take a look..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Level Five Realm enveloped the entire Augustine Estate, and with a thought, he was able to scan every corner of the estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the members of the Augustine family, young and old, had managed to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there were still faint energy signatures lingering on Mount Celestial Reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star frowned. "Is there someone still left behind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, he reached out with his power, only to pull it back with a grave expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it; it's there. I can't worry about that now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All I can do is hold these people here for an hour! I've done my part; anything else is beyond my concern!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the God of Star closed his eyes, pouring every ounce of his strength into maintaining the Level Five Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body trembled violently, clearly on the verge of collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, atop Mount Celestial Reach, in a secluded room, Zoe was barricading the door, pushing everything she could find against it. Biting her lip, she stared at the figure in the center of the room, lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That figure was Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe said, determination in her voice, "Anastasia, everyone from the Augustine family has escaped! It's just us now! But don't worry, I won't leave you behind!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your power is too immense. Aside from Osborne, no one can approach you&mdash;not even Mr. Wesson Augustine with the Godfather's scepter. They couldn't take you with them, so please don't blame them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just hope we don't get discovered! I really hope Osborne comes back soon to get us out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Zoe found a spot to sit down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned her gaze to the corner of the room and suddenly spotted a pair of glowing eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe smiled, "At least Divine Shadow is still here! At least we have Divine Shadow with us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She waved her hand at Divine Shadow, but to her disappointment, it ignored her completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It slinked out from the shadows, moving with an air of lazy indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow glided toward the center of the room, circling around Anastasia as if sizing her up before inching closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe called out urgently, "Divine Shadow, don't go over there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia's power is incredibly strong. Unless it's Osborne, anyone who gets too close will face an attack from that force. You really shouldn't get any closer, or you could get hurt&mdash;maybe even worse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her warnings, Divine Shadow paused only to glance back at Zoe, then continued on its path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's heart raced; she lunged forward, but it was already too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her astonishment, Divine Shadow leaped onto Anastasia, curling up comfortably in her arms as if it belonged there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's jaw dropped in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of jealousy washed over her, and she pouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia, this is so unfair! I'm your sister, for Pete's sake! I get that Osborne can approach you. He has that bond with you. But why does Divine Shadow get to snuggle up to you while I can't?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, I'm going to your side too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she moved closer, a powerful surge of energy erupted, threatening to hurl her backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, Divine Shadow lifted its head, and the force vanished into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe felt a rush of relief and hurried to Anastasia's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the atmosphere suddenly shifted as energy pulses rippled around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe gasped, saying, "Oh no!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Light Realm is fading! They're coming!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
