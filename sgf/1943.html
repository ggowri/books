  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was momentarily speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "So, Lord Malevolence and God of Night have been eyeing the Creation Herald's treasure for years?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They've tried multiple times and ended up injured?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smirk, the Creation Herald said, "Oh, just a few decades back, those two thought they could take advantage of my predicament with that tree. They did manage to sneak into my vault, but they had no idea that it was itself a super divine artifact! Even after getting in, they nearly met their end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, they walked away with a few trinkets, but they were left so battered that they still haven't fully recovered."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shot Osborne a cold look, his voice dripping with disdain. "If you think you're tougher than Lord Malevolence and God of Night, feel free to give it a shot! But trust me, you'd be wise not to! Even if I open the vault, you wouldn't dare step inside. It's a death sentence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing that the Creation Herald wasn't bluffing, he quickly clarified, "You've got it all wrong! I'd never think of raiding your vault! I'm just curious, that's all. I'm not greedy..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he eagerly took the three Dimensional Bags from the Creation Herald, excitement bubbling within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, it was the Creation Herald who felt a little lost for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Not greedy? You're asking for a million Miracle Elixirs, 10 billion Celestial Crystals, and a hundred super divine artifacts! That's quite a haul!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald snorted, "You better not be greedy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Out of that million Miracle Elixirs, 400 thousand are yellow, and 400 thousand are blue! That's drained my entire stock! I couldn't be bothered to go out and gather more, so I've thrown in 200 thousand white and black Miracle Elixirs for good measure!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up at the mention of the elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened one of the Dimensional Bags and, to his delight, found a million Miracle Elixirs inside. His excitement soared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "I've spent ages scouring the South, East, North, and Central Zones of Celestara, and I only managed to gather around 600 thousand Miracle Elixirs. And now, just like that, I've got a million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sweet deal!" he exclaimed, quickly stashing them away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then opened another Dimensional Bag and was greeted by the sight of 10 billion Celestial Crystals. A broad grin spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of value, 10 billion Celestial Crystals far surpassed a million Miracle Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this kind of wealth, Osborne wouldn't just be set for a while; even the Hudson family and the entire West Zone Human Community would be well off for ages!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tucked those away too, feeling like he'd hit the jackpot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With anticipation, he opened the last Dimensional Bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If everything went as expected, it should contain the hundred super divine artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, there were fifty defensive divine artifacts and fifty weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me introduce you to them!" The Creation Herald waved his hand, and the Dimensional Bag flew back to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, he revealed a stunning piece of armor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the Rainbow Armor! A masterpiece of mine, specially designed for women. It retains vibrant colors while boasting defense at least five times stronger than the Supreme Sovereign's Armor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, the Supreme Sovereign's Armor is also one of my creations, but compared to this, it's practically junk! The Rainbow Armor even has exceptional resistance against soul attacks!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that life elemental Supernal Deity King from the Paramount Supreme Clan had been wearing the Rainbow Armor instead of the Supreme Sovereign's Armor, you'd have never stood a chance against him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald's pride was palpable, and Osborne couldn't help but be impressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five times the defense of the Supreme Sovereign's Armor? And it can guard against soul attacks?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's breath quickened, excitement flooding his senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "That's an incredible piece of gear! Too bad it looks a bit too feminine for my taste."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald caught the gleam in Osborne's eyes and puffed up with pride. "Of course, the effectiveness of the armor is always tied to the strength of its wearer. The armor serves to enhance the efficiency of your divine power defense!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The stronger you are, the more formidable its protection becomes! Trust me, this Rainbow Armor would still be highly valuable even against the Ascension Five and Ascension Six Supernal Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got twenty of these ready for you! Perfect gifts for your female friends&mdash;who could possibly turn that down?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the Creation Herald conjured another set of armor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This one exuded a fierce, menacing aura, its sharp angles and bold design screaming power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the Dominion Battle Suit!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It offers similar benefits as the Rainbow Armor, but I've designed it specifically for men! I've prepared thirty of these for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that's some fantastic gear!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He itched to try on the Dominion Battle Suit right then and there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to express his excitement, the Creation Herald produced another piece of armor that instantly captured Osborne's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This one was striking&mdash;a deep crimson suit of armor that commanded attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its base was a brilliant white material, splattered with countless blood-red dots that made it look like it was soaked in blood from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flowing behind it was a matching red cloak, radiating an intense energy that Osborne could feel from across the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne asked eagerly, unable to contain himself, "What's this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You said we had fifty pieces of defensive divine artifacts already&mdash;what's this one for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald smirked and replied, "This armor is for you as well! However, it doesn't count among the hundred super divine artifacts you requested&mdash;this one's a lifesaver!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's called Bloodwrought Armor, and it's my most treasured defensive creation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This armor is crafted from the strongest bones of the Sacred Dragon Clan's formidable warriors, who left behind these rare materials after death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The red flecks you see? That's the blood of their powerful lineage! Even without activating divine power, the Bloodwrought Armor's defensive capabilities rival those of the Rainbow Armor and Dominion Battle Suit. And when you do activate it? Its strength skyrockets!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It can withstand assaults from even Ascension Eight Supernal Deity Kings and beyond! Plus, if it gets damaged, it has the ability to repair itself automatically! When not in use, it can merge with your body, growing stronger over time!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
