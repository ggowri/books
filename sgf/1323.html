  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep within a cavern several hundred yards beneath the surface, the gathering was unlike anything Osborne had anticipated. The Dark Deities, usually monstrous and terrifying, had all transformed into human forms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without his Satan's Eye, he might never have discovered their hidden meeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he drew nearer through the parallel space, Osborne noticed that the thousand-strong assembly was split into two factions, embroiled in a heated debate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One group, consisting of only a few dozen individuals, caught his attention immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Intrigued, Osborne stealthily moved closer, eavesdropping on the unfolding conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he discovered sent shockwaves through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those few dozen didn't belong to the Dark Deity ranks at all&mdash;they were humans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Osborne gasped internally, his mind racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had assumed these beings were plotting how to attack human cities or eradicate the inhabitants of Blue Planet. Instead, it appeared that a cabal of human powers was engaged in negotiations with the Dark Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His instincts kicked in. Something was amiss here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne strained to listen more intently, and soon, his disbelief turned to horror. The humans gathered included members of the Pantheon League and warriors from the Eityreia Organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Apocalypse Harbinger, we can't accept your proposal!" A voice rang out from the assemblage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's gaze snapped to the speaker&mdash;a man representing the Pantheon League, identified as Nelson Thornberry. His eyes were locked onto a towering Dark Deity who, even in human form, towered at over eight feet tall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This figure exuded a fearsome aura, clearly the strongest among the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was their leader, one whose power approached the pinnacle of a Transcendent Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside Nelson stood a shadowy figure cloaked in black, the representative of the Eityreia Organization, known as Emperor Dare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pondered, "What on earth are the Pantheon League, the Eityreia Organization, and these Dark Deities planning together? Have they already formed an alliance? Humans joining forces with Dark Deities?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression darkened at the thought. If the Pantheon League and Eityreia Organization were indeed colluding with the Dark Deities, it would be a grave betrayal of humanity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the surge of killing intent in his heart, Osborne held his position, calming himself to continue eavesdropping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Apocalypse Harbinger exclaimed, "Mr. Nelson Thornberry, Mr. Emperor Dare, why the opposition? My proposal offers nothing but benefits for both the Pantheon League and the Eityreia Organization!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must realize this world is far too small to accommodate two dominant forces like yours. Furthermore, the incomplete world rules here mean you can only ascend to Transcendent Deity at most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I suspect many warriors within your factions are hesitant to awaken, unwilling to settle for just regaining their Transcendent Deity forms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To thrive, you need to return to Celestara, which is now under the dominion of Lord Malevolence&mdash;our Dark Deity lands! The only way to survive in Celestara is to submit to Lord Malevolence. You're well aware of Lord Malevolence's might!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even while injured, he could devastate Celestara, against which countless gods could not prevail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After a thousand years, his power has not only recovered but is even greater. And how about human deities? How many are still out there? Huh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To refuse allegiance to Lord Malevolence is to choose death alongside other humans!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Filled with disdain, the Apocalypse Harbinger continued, "As a mid-level commander in Lord Malevolence's Dark Deity Legion, I assure you, submit to him, and you'll secure vast lands in Celestara to prosper&mdash;stronger than your prior peaks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, you must serve Lord Malevolence, eradicating those pesky human vermin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's my offer. Cooperate with us to eliminate all human powers here, then return to Celestara and pledge loyalty to Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or walk away now, but know we'd be enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Frankly, don't underestimate us. Eradicating you with your current strength would be a breeze! The Dark Deity Legion intends to claim this world, make no mistake!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Apocalypse Harbinger exuded a chilling arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nelson of the Pantheon League and Emperor Dare of the Eityreia Organization exchanged weary glances, resignation etched on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a heavy sigh, they finally conceded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, we agree. We are willing to submit to Lord Malevolence..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
