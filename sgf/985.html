  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All fifty Class AAA assassins of the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization lay dead at Osborne's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were the elite of the elite, feared shadows that brought death and carnage wherever they went.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here they were, taken down one after another by Osborne's stealthy strikes. It was ridiculous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Osborne, it felt perfectly normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strength had reached a level where this was expected. Still, he didn't let his guard down; to him, these Class AAA assassins were mere minions. The real threats were Scarlett and the two Class S assassins lurking in the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were the true test of his abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his senses heightened, Osborne remained acutely aware of his surroundings. His actions had undoubtedly drawn attention, and he was certain that the assassins had contacted Scarlett and the Class S killers before they met their end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, as he scanned the area, neither Scarlett nor the Class S assassins had shown themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could they really be far away?" Osborne murmured but quickly dismissed the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlett had only recently executed a hit on Maia; she wouldn't have strayed too far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most likely, she was using her Stealth Art, hidden from his sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's vigilance only heightened further at the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Osborne's Satan's Eye flared with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Danger! Ambush!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, he lunged forward, moving with blinding speed. But even then, he felt a sharp pain stab into his back as a wickedly sharp dagger pierced his flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne hadn't reacted so quickly and dashed forward, that blade would have pierced his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Osborne growled, his expression hardening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spun around but found nothing&mdash;only eerie silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlett was there, lurking in the shadows, ready to strike again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her attempt at a lethal ambush had failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, she activated her Stealth Art again, trying to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled coldly, refusing to let her slip away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately unleashed his Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Domain!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Spatial Domain enveloped an area of hundreds of yards around him. In an instant, he spotted Scarlett, who was already several hundred yards away, on the verge of escaping his grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But luck was not on her side; she was too slow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic flickered across Scarlett's face as she launched a frenzied attack, desperate to shatter Osborne's Spatial Domain and break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew all too well that without the advantage of stealth, she stood no chance against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her past encounters with Osborne had made that painfully clear&mdash;he was far stronger than she was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regret washed over Scarlett. She cursed her decision to target Osborne, her attacks growing more frantic as she sought to break through his defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alas, she was utterly incapable of doing that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Osborne's Spatial Domain had not yet reached Level Three, it was at its peak at Level Two. Scarlett, with her prowess, might break it, but it would require time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne wasn't about to give her the time she needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Space Stretching!" Osborne called out with a mocking smile, waving his hand lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Scarlett found herself drifting further away from the edge of the Spatial Domain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could react, Osborne materialized right in front of her, a predator closing in on its prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, his voice dripping with mockery, "Scarlett, here we are again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But this time, Marlon and Bradley aren't here to back you up. I wonder, will you manage to escape my grasp this time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlett's face drained of color as she clenched her jaw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, this is a matter between us and the Lambert family. Are you really going to stick your nose in? I suggest you let me go right now. Do you have any idea who I am? My parents are 'Sin' and 'Crimson.' They're among the top assassins in the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, ranked second and third! Both of them are also in the top fifty of the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'd be wise to think twice before making me your enemy. Even Sebastian from the Augustine family wouldn't dare to provoke my parents. If you touch a single hair on my head, you're as good as dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like ice melting on a spring day, Scarlett's face once again regained its calm, but there was a menacing glint in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle at her bravado.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Using your parents to intimidate me? That's rich! Even if I let you live, your parents wouldn't spare me or the Augustine family. So why should I hesitate to end you here and now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't about to waste any more time. He knew there were still two Class S assassins out there, and he had no intention of letting Scarlett escape again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Prison! Space Collapse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlett's expression shifted to one of horror as she realized there was no room for luck this time. She had to fight with everything she had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plant Realm!" Scarlett shouted, summoning her powers in a desperate bid to hold him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you can't kill me! The other two Class S assassins are nearby! If I can just stall you for a bit, they'll come to rescue me and finish you off!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
