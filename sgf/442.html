  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie smiled, "Let me introduce you. These four are our junior classmates, all graduates of the Power Prodigy Class.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is Larson, ranked sixth in the 30th Power Prodigy Class, from the Hayes family in Newport City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is Pierson, ranked ninth in the same class, from the Barnett family in Newport City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is my sister, Nadine Powell, who ranked twelfth in the 30th Power Prodigy Class.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And this one, I must especially introduce. This is Evelynn Augustine, my sister's close friend, who ranked third in the 30th Power Prodigy Class.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's from the Augustine family in Newport City."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's eyes widened in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected that these four were all members of the Power Prodigy Class, just five years his junior. What shocked him even more was their rankings. Even the lowest-ranked among them had placed twelfth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Evelynn was in the top three!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having attended the Power Prodigy Class himself, Alexander knew just how difficult it was to achieve such high rankings in that group. These individuals were undoubtedly super-geniuses, possessing elite strength unmatched by their peers across Rosmandi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, they all hailed from the ancient families of Newport City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Families that had endured for centuries, even millennia, in Newport City were exceedingly powerful. Weaker families had long since been eliminated or driven out, leaving only the strongest to endure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, the ancient families of Newport City were on an entirely different level from the Paltrow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what stunned Alexander the most was the girl Charlie particularly introduced, Evelynn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said she was from the Augustine family in Newport City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a serious expression, Alexander asked, "Charlie, when you mention the Augustine family of Newport City, are you talking about the family of the Godfather?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie smiled and replied, "In Newport City, is there any other Augustine family? You should make sure to satisfy her. If she's not satisfied, I won't let you off the hook!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's been a bit weary of life in Newport City. After recently breaking through to Class A, she finally gained the freedom to leave her family and travel. She heard that you have broken through to Class A, are about to inherit the position of the head of the Paltrow family, and are going to hold a wedding, so she suggested coming to visit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The rest of us are here mainly to accompany her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing this, Alexander looked at Evelynn in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn was five years younger than him, which meant she was only twenty-three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet she had already reached Class A.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Alexander's pride crumbled. He bowed slightly and greeted Evelynn with great respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Augustine, I'll make sure you're well taken care of."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn remained calm and said indifferently, "No need to be so formal. We're the ones intruding. Arrange things as you see fit. I'm feeling a bit tired, so please take me to rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, we'll head back right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For the duration of your stay, you'll be at the Paltrow Estate. The accommodations may be humble, and I hope you won't mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander quickly led the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he escorted the group back to the Paltrow Estate and settled them in the finest guest rooms available.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He instructed everyone in the Paltrow family to be extremely cautious with these guests. No matter their requests, they were to be fulfilled unconditionally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He told the servants that if there were any of their requests couldn't be met, they should immediately inform him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, Alexander took this matter very seriously, and his attitude towards the five people was even a bit humble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His performance satisfied all five people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After bidding them farewell, Alexander quickly returned to his study, his face growing cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander cursed, "That bastard Charlie. He didn't come here to attend my inheritance ceremony. He came to flaunt his superiority! And that Evelynn from the Augustine family, what does she have to be so proud of? She's just lucky to have been born into the Augustine family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I'd been born into the Augustine family, I'd be just as powerful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was seething with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade frowned and said, "Alexander, don't be upset. They come from ancient families in Newport City, so we can't afford to offend them for now. You need to continue treating them politely on the surface. But this situation won't last forever!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're deeply tied to the Augustine family in Newport City and can be considered their vassals. Once the Aberrants return to Rosmandi, these people are done for! The Aberrants won't let them off the hook!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone associated with the Godfather will meet a miserable end!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And our family will rise rapidly with the Aberrants' backing. When that time comes, they'll no longer be able to act superior in front of you. They'll be begging for your mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade's words made Alexander's anger finally subside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded and said, "Wade, I understand. I just hope the Aberrants return to Rosmandi soon and reshuffle the power structure!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They will!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the next few days, Alexander diligently attended to the five guests, taking them to local attractions and ensuring they were thoroughly entertained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've done well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Evelynn expressed her satisfaction with Alexander's hospitality. She said calmly, "Tomorrow is your inheritance ceremony, isn't it? I hear your wedding is on the same day. You don't need to attend to us anymore. You should focus on your own affairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll attend your inheritance ceremony and wedding tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing this, Alexander quickly showed a delighted expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Augustine, it will be my honor to have you at my inheritance ceremony. I've reserved the best seats for you guys. You're most welcome to join us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alexander took his leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once out of their sight, his expression instantly turned icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "Tomorrow is my wedding day!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, will you show up?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
