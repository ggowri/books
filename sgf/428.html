  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ryan, don't you dare!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ryan, let Osborne go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ryan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one saw it coming. In a flash, Ryan had made his move, pinning Osborne and holding a sharp dagger to his throat, his face a mask of murderous rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stared at Osborne with worried eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Isaac sighed, a deep sadness flickering in his eyes. He took one last lingering look at Ryan before closing his eyes again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan, unaware of Isaac's reaction, spoke coldly, "Don't come any closer, or I'll slit his throat! He may be stronger, but he let his guard down. Now that I've got him, one slip of my hand and he's dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd stood frozen, their faces grim, not daring to make a move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa gritted her teeth and said, "So, Ryan, you really are the Augustine family's mole, aren't you? Osborne was right about you all along."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan's face twisted into a snarl as he replied with a grin, "So what? Yeah, he is damn right! I'm the Augustine family's mole. Yes, I leaked their secrets. But what of it? I've done nothing wrong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The ones in the wrong are the Augustines!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Old man, if you had just handed the head of the family position to my father back then, there wouldn't be so much trouble now. He was far more capable and could have led the Augustine family to greatness! But just because he wasn't related to you by blood, you gave him no chance at all!" Ryan glared at Isaac with deep resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac's body trembled as he opened his eyes and spoke, "Ryan, put down the dagger! If you admit your mistake, I'll still be your grandfather. Even though you've made a huge mistake, I promise that even if it costs me my dignity, I'll do everything I can to save your life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Put down the dagger, and I'll send you somewhere far away." Isaac's eyes were filled with pleading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ryan felt no warmth from his words. He sneered and burst out laughing. "Old man, what's the point of saying this now? If you really still see me as your grandson, then help me kill Osborne right away! If you kill him, Alexander from the Paltrow family will definitely be pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can also promise you that as long as Osborne is dead, I can make sure the Paltrow family spares the Augustine family. They won't wipe us out! Just let me become the head of the Augustine family, and I guarantee the Augustine family will continue to thrive and grow stronger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac wanted to say something but ended with a sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes filled with remorse. "It's all my fault. I didn't raise you properly! It's all my fault!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, tears streamed down his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The truth is, your real grandfather was my best friend. He died in an accident, leaving your newborn father in my care. He asked me to raise him right and make sure he grew up to be a good man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I adopted your father. To shield him from being mistreated or looked down upon, I hid his true identity and told everyone in the Augustine family he was my own son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I shouldn't have lied back then!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe this is my karma. If I had told your father the truth about his parentage sooner, you two wouldn't be so desperate to take over the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least this way, you could still be alive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now, I've failed your real grandfather, and I've let down my friend!" Isaac said, his face already wet with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked deeply at Ryan as if it were the last time he would ever see him, his gaze gradually turning cold and stern. "You shouldn't have taken Osborne hostage. He's the last hope of the Augustine family, and you had no right to try and kill him! Now, even I can't save you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rest in peace. When my time comes, I'll personally tell your grandfather all about it in hell." With that, Isaac closed his eyes again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rest in peace? Old man, do you really think I'm going to die? Hah! Why would I? He's the Augustine family's last hope, and I have him right where I want him. Let's see who dares to make a move against me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll kill anyone who tries!" Ryan's face contorted with a manic grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne finally spoke up, his tone calm and indifferent. "Ryan, you really should have listened to Isaac, even if just once. It could have saved your life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But too bad. You blew your one chance to live. Now, as a traitor to the Augustine family, it's time for you to pay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's words sent Ryan into a fury. "Shut up! If you say one more word, I'll kill you right now! Don't think I won't do it. If it comes down to it, we'll die together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die together? Do you really think you're that worthy?" Osborne sneered coldly. "If you don't believe me, why don't you try?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan's face twisted with rage. "Are you provoking me? Then you'll pay the price for that! You asked for it. I'll slit your throat right now and teach you a lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a chilling glint in his eyes, he slashed the dagger towards Osborne's throat. His sudden move left everyone around him in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! Ryan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They screamed, but it was too late to stop Ryan. His hand tightened around the dagger as he slashed it across Osborne's throat with all his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the next moment, a strange sound echoed. The dagger struck Osborne's throat as if it had hit solid steel. It didn't even scratch his skin, let alone cut his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of martial art aura erupted from Osborne's throat, blocking the sharp dagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Ryan was stunned.</span></p><div class="pagination">
