  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena's killing of Medusa seemed like a mere trifle to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to look at Osborne and Clarissa, her eyes revealing a strange light as she noticed the Divine and Demonic Wings behind Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nodded at Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa felt a surge of excitement but was at a loss for words, clinging tightly to Osborne's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena smiled at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Young man, are you really ready to be together? Do you understand who is she? She is the </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span>. Being with her could lead to your death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words struck Osborne dumb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel Clarissa's grip on his arm tighten, a sign of her anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Osborne gently patted Clarissa's hand and declared, "Ms. Hernandez, I am prepared! No matter what the future holds, I will be with Clarissa. I will face everything with her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena fell silent at his response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very well. Since you've made your decision, I won't add more, lest it do more harm than good. In any case, I must warn you to be extra careful moving forward. I don't wish to hear of your demise because I know... that person who finds it hard to express themselves would be heartbroken."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne bit his lip, aware that the person Serena referred to was his grandfather, Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Would Godfather truly grieve if I died?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't know. He had yet to meet the man of legend face to face. He had no idea what kind of person Godfather was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just nodded, saying, "I will be cautious!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa looked on with a puzzled expression, not understanding their conversation or who Serena was referring to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she was wise and didn't inquire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sensed vaguely that the relationship between Osborne and Serena was extraordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Caution is critical! The world is far more complex than you think! For ordinary people, it might be safer, but for our kind, it's tough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grow stronger. A new storm is about to begin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hernandez, does this new storm mean the return of the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena shook her head. "It's more than that! But these matters have no bearing on you now. Focus on growing stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And for you, you need not worry about assassinations from The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> anymore. If the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> isn't hopelessly foolish, he won't send anyone after you again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was ecstatic at this news. "Really? That's great!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena replied calmly, "However, don't assume you're safe just because The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> won't assassinate you. In this world, fools are the majority. They understand so little of the world and yet act recklessly. It's like courting disaster!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In any case, continue to be cautious. If you die, this young man will go mad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Embarrassed, Osborne rubbed his nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa blushed and clung tighter to his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will be careful, Ms. Hernandez."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena waved her hand. "You may go. Leave this place to me; it won't involve you. Do not speak of today's events to anyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa frowned, "Ms. Hernandez, my aunt and my bodyguards are still petrified. Can you save them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena smiled faintly, "Why would I need to intervene? You are better equipped to save them than I am. Your Holy Light Healing can release them from the petrification and mend their bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, even if they are freed from stone, they will suffer severe aftereffects."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Urged by her words, Clarissa quickly activated her power, using Holy Light to free Donna and the eight bodyguards from their petrified state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they had been petrified for so long that they were all dazed. Fortunately, Clarissa's healing took care of their physical ailments. With a few days of rest, they would be as good as new.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne led Clarissa away from Rose Castle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wedding that was supposed to belong to Wesley and Ophelia had not even begun and was now over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was unlikely to happen again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of Ophelia's madness, Osborne shook his head, feeling that revenge against Ophelia was no longer interesting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Ophelia had forced him to divorce her, he had been desperate for revenge, wanting her to kneel before him in repentance to make all of the Caldwell family regret their actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Osborne suddenly felt that all of that was pointless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For ordinary people, the high society was untouchable, but for him now, families like the </span><span>Caldwells</span><span> and the </span><span>Ashfords</span><span> no longer meant anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Competing with Ophelia was pointless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He already had Clarissa and even Austin. As long as Ophelia did not provoke him again, he would let her become a memory that faded with the wind!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne held Clarissa's hand tightly and quickly returned to the Radcliffe Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news of their public relationship spread like a storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, it reached the Radcliffe family.</span></p><div class="pagination">
