  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, a heavy drumbeat echoed through Elf City, growing louder with each thump.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It caused the countless Elf Trees to sway gently in the rhythm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stepped outside his cabin, eyes wide with surprise as he looked deeper into the city. "What's happening?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's voice cut through the air beside him. "That's the war drums of the Ethereal Elven Temple!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The temple is summoning us! It's time for us to head to Umbra Earth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spoke with determination, but Osborne could see the tension in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was her first time leaving Elf City, and everything outside its familiar walls felt uncertain and frightening. Umbra Earth in particular was shrouded in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, doubt wormed its way into her heart, a primal fear that something monstrous lurked beyond the city limits, waiting to swallow her whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This dread ran deep, not even the fierce beat of the war drums could chase it away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne saw her body tremble slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alfreda, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stepped closer, gently patting her shoulder as he furrowed his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Startled, Alfreda raised her gaze to meet his. That small gesture, that concern in his eyes, felt like the warmth of fire meeting ice; her fear began to melt away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She let out a long breath, smiling as she replied, "I'm fine! I mean, what could possibly go wrong? Just feeling a bit excited about the adventure to Umbra Earth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, I'm the powerful Princess Alfreda!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you, on the other hand, your cultivation level is way too low. Once we leave Elf City, you need to make sure you stay within my sight. I can only keep you safe if you're close by!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alfreda felt her cheeks flush but quickly masked her embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle inwardly at her concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood that she was afraid&mdash;afraid of the unknown that lay beyond Elf City&mdash;but he chose not to address it directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he nodded, saying, "Don't worry. I won't stray far from you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That seemed to put her at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the rest of their exploration team arrived, drawn by the echoing war drums.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avery, Godfrey, Hermione, Neville, Arabela, Beverly, and Cyrus&mdash;it was time for the nine to stand united.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's </span><span>go</span><span>!" Alfreda declared, her spirits lifted as she waved her hand, leading them toward the Combat Arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thundering rhythm of the Ethereal Elven Temple's war drums continued for a hundred vigorous beats before finally subsiding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Combat Arena, things were buzzing with energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the exploration teams set to depart for Umbra Earth gathered in anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be precise, there were one hundred exploration teams in total!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and Alfreda stood at the edge of the arena, observing the scene unfold. A sense of gravity filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you believe there are a hundred teams?" Osborne said, astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda replied, "Umbra Earth is special. Only ten thousand individuals can enter at once, and each exploration team can have a maximum of one hundred members. So, we've got exactly one hundred teams heading for Umbra Earth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Twenty of those are from the Ethereal Elven Temple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're so powerful that they don't need to recruit warriors from the various races; their teams are made up entirely of Light Elf Clan members!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then there are sixteen teams from the Shadow Elf Clan Royal Family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Sylvan Elf Clan and Thunder Elf Clan Royal Families each have eight teams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Six teams hail from the Storm Elf Clan Royal Family, four from the Fire Elf Clan Royal Family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three from the Ocean Elf Clan Royal Family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These exploration teams from the various Royal Families are all led by a prince or princess. Their teams consist of fifty elite warrior guards from each Royal Family, along with recruits from the hundred different races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even the powerful races within Elf City formed their own exploration teams! For instance, the Human Community has two slots for teams. The same goes for the Shadow Clan, Beast Clan, Thunderhorn Clan, and more...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Add us into the mix, and there are exactly one hundred exploration teams!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's voice was clear, revealing the structure of their mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued, "In Umbra Earth, they'll be both our allies and competitors. The situation there is quite complex; sometimes, we'll need to band together to tackle dangers that arise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But when it comes to treasures, that's when it's every team for itself! The strongest participants get first dibs on the loot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tone turned serious, capturing the weight of the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she scanned the surroundings, she recognized a disheartening fact&mdash;apart from their odd little group, every other exploration team was at full strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of those teams boasted one hundred members!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here they were, just nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the other teams caught sight of Alfreda's group, their gazes flickered with skepticism. When they noticed that they were down to just nine members&mdash;especially with Osborne, whose cultivation level was merely Ascension One from the Human Community&mdash;they couldn't help but break into sardonic smirks and mocking laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda bristled, teeth clenching in irritation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne detected their palpable malice in the air&mdash;a dangerous undercurrent of hostility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He discreetly activated Satan's Eye to pinpoint the source of these ill intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was when he spotted Prince Desmond and Princess Monica, their icy stares locked onto him and Alfreda, filled with unmistakable hostility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind Desmond stood four others, equally intent on them: Pierce, Nell, Killian, and Harley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph!" Osborne let out a scoffing sound, not letting it get to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His venture to Umbra Earth was solely for treasures that could swiftly enhance his cultivation level and strength. Osborne had no interest in stirring up trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if Prince Desmond or Princess Monica wanted to make a scene during their expedition, he wouldn't hesitate to send them packing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Umbra Earth wasn't Elf City, where titles mattered. Out here, their royal status would hold no sway over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shifted his gaze away from them, looking at other teams instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, look at that power!" Osborne exclaimed in surprise, his eyes wide as he beheld the Ethereal Elven Temple's contingent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ethereal Elven Temple had a total of twenty exploration teams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each team was led by an Oracle Heir or Oracle Heiress, their status on par with the princes and princesses of the major Royal Families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lowest cultivation level among those twenty Oracle Heirs and Heiresses was Ascension Five Supernal Deity King&mdash;impressive by any standard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them were seven Ascension Six, and one particularly stood out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King&mdash;a glowing elf of extraordinary presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King was also the one with the highest cultivation level among the nearly ten thousand people entering Umbra Earth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When anyone turned their gaze toward him, awe and reverence shone in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the princes and princesses of other Royal Families regarded him with respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was filled with curiosity. "Who is that?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
