  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Osborne was deep in meditation, the West Zone buzzed with hysteria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>News had broken that the Baxter family and the Faulkner family, two prominent Dukedom Level Powers, had been wiped out overnight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ramifications sent shockwaves through the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Dark Deity Legion looming on the horizon and an all-out war imminent, the sudden and silent annihilation of two major families left everyone in a state of confusion and dread. No one knew who was behind the attack, and the entire community was gripped by panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Other Dukedom Level Powers were filled with anxiety, hyper-aware that they might be next on the chopping block.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the God of Light learned of the situation, she was momentarily stunned but wasted no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She swiftly convened an urgent meeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leaders of the remaining eighteen Dukedom Level Powers gathered once more in the Sanctum of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the God of Light arrived, the atmosphere was electric with tension and intrigue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It must be the Paramount Supreme Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only the Paramount Supreme Clan possesses such overwhelming strength! Right in the midst of our debates, they wiped out the Baxter and Faulkner families! To eliminate them without a trace is a move only they could pull off!" another added, his tone laced with accusation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are they trying to intimidate us? Is this some sort of a warning to force us into submission?" a third voice chimed in, fear creeping into the dialogue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why target the Baxter and Faulkner specifically?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will we be next?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the leaders engaged in heated arguments, Jethro sat quietly in the corner, absorbing their words without offering a single opinion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the God of Light finally appeared, a brilliant aura enveloped her, silencing the room instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every head turned toward her, filled with respect and reverence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The esteemed God of Light!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The esteemed God of Light!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the leaders, including Jethro, stood immediately and bowed in respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light smiled gently, waving them down. "Please, take your seats. No need for such formality."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she settled onto her throne, her expression turned serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She scanned the room with a piercing gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all know why I summoned you. Just a day ago, the Baxter family and the Faulkner family fell victim to an unknown force. Both clans have been... extinguished."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gravity of her words cast a pall over the assembly. Faces grew tense, filled with dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One member stood, voice raised. "It has to be the Paramount Supreme Clan! They have the audacity to send warriors into the West Zone for assassination and total annihilation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How arrogant of them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We must fight back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual flick of her wrist, the God of Light restored order to the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, let's not jump to conclusions. This wasn't the work of the Paramount Supreme Clan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gasps echoed around the room as disbelief washed over the gathered leaders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone questioned, eyebrows knitting together in concern, "How could it not be the Paramount Supreme Clan?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're the only force in all of Celestara capable of striking down two major families and vanishing without a trace!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are we to believe it was the Sanctum of Light itself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He abruptly halted, eyes widening as the implications sank in. "The esteemed God of Light... you can't mean it was your Sanctum of Light that did this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light kept her demeanor serene, offering no explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, she simply clapped her hands together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, two disheveled figures were pushed into the chamber, bound by heavy chains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their appearances were nothing short of pitiful. The sight struck fear into the leaders, causing them to leap to their feet, expressions painted with shock and apprehension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cicero!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Benno!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're still alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock rippled through the crowd as they stared at the God of Light. Cicero, the head of the Baxter family, and Benno, the head of the Faulkner family, had been seen just days ago strategizing alongside them and the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they were being dragged in like common prisoners, bound and humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leaders exchanged bewildered glances, waiting for an explanation from the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression hardened, and she turned her icy gaze on the two men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cicero! Benno! Why don't you tell everyone here what you've been up to these past years?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bitter laugh escaped Cicero's lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Light, let's not pretend here. We've lost, and there's nothing more to say. If you have the guts, just kill me! The Baxter family is gone, and living on is meaningless. Go ahead, end it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benno chimed in, a sardonic edge to his voice, "You've won this round, God of Light!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We were curious how you figured out we had betrayed the Human Community. How did you know we had aligned ourselves with Lord Malevolence? You sent your people in with such ferocity, wiping out both our families!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before we even sensed a thing! You really went all out... eliminating our entire clans without a single soul escaping!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We truly regret not having taken you out sooner, not teaming up with the Paramount Supreme Clan to finish you off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We regret it so much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cicero and Benno's voices echoed with despair, but their admissions left the other leaders in stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Baxter and Faulkner families had betrayed the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had even plotted with the Paramount Supreme Clan against the God of Light!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the God of Light had led her team to wipe out their families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was thick with tension as everyone turned to the God of Light, their breaths catching in their throats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the God of Light frowned, her mind racing. She knew the truth: neither the Baxter family nor the Faulkner family had been eliminated by her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, she hadn't even been aware of their betrayal until now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These two had been delivered to the Sanctum of Light by a mysterious figure, and the details surrounding their downfall were still murky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that was irrelevant now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light scoffed, her voice cold as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Cicero and Benno, you admit to your betrayal of the Human Community?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both men sneered in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Light, what does it matter if we admit it? Our families are gone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you kill us now, what's the point? The Human Community in the West Zone can't withstand the Dark Deity Legion! And God of Night stands no chance against Lord Malevolence! The Human Community is doomed to fall!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The only way forward is to surrender to the Paramount Supreme Clan, to lay down our weapons and submit to Lord Malevolence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You stubborn fools who refuse to yield will meet your end sooner or later!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light's expression hardened further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you acknowledge your betrayal, there's nothing more to discuss. You deserve to die for your treachery!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the name of the Sanctum of Light, I hereby sentence you both to execution!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those chilling words, she raised her hand, and a beam of light descended upon the two men. Their bodies began to glow, radiating an intense light from within. In moments, they were disintegrating, their forms breaking apart and vanishing into nothingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Cicero and Benno were gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sanctum of Light fell into a profound silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light surveyed the remaining leaders with a steely gaze. She couldn't shake the unsettling feeling that among them, there might still be traitors lurking in the shadows, those who had sided with Lord Malevolence.</span></p><div class="pagination">
