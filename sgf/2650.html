  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Adriana finished speaking, an overwhelming aura erupted around her. The Crystal Armor on her body shimmered with dazzling light, and an unyielding will surged from within her, permeating the air.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This instantly made Frederick's face darken.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He let out a cold snort, his tone full of disdain. "Good! Very good! I've given you three chances, yet you don't cherish them. Do you really think I must marry you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since that's the case, then go die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fairy Moon Sect has always been the greatest threat to the Royal Family. Since you refuse to submit and won't let Fairy Moon Sect become a subordinate of the Royal Family, then don't even think about continuing to exist!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I hereby declare, you are already a dead person!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fairy Moon Sect, today you shall be completely destroyed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick turned to the others and said coldly, "What about you? Will you also choose to be unyielding like Adriana? If you refuse to submit to me, refuse to bow to the Royal Family, there is only one outcome&mdash;death! Your sects will be destroyed along with you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll give you thirty breaths to decide!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Within these thirty breaths, anyone willing to submit can come to my side. I promise not to harm you. As long as you no longer threaten the Royal Family, your sects can continue to exist."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Otherwise, after thirty breaths, all who refuse to submit will die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Frederick began counting down with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the twenty-plus Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors from various major forces wore grim expressions, their faces filled with struggle and hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of them finally couldn't help but speak, "Frederick, why must you force us like this? Our forces have developed within the Glorious Divine Kingdom, contributing greatly to this territory. Not only do we offer vast resources and wealth annually, but we have also assisted multiple times in repelling foreign enemies."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Have you forgotten? When the Evernight Court invaded the Glorious Divine Kingdom back then, I personally led my sect's warriors to fight alongside you and repel the enemy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick sneered after hearing this. "So what? By making your forces subordinate to the Royal Family, I can better control you and command you to serve me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, you have only two choices: submit or perish!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, the man's face grew even darker, and his inner struggle became more intense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If possible, he just wanted to escape from here immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, they were now trapped in Necropolis City, and the only exit, the black vortex, was in turmoil, its danger far exceeding Frederick. Moreover, it wouldn't calm down for at least ten days.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this situation, they either submit to Frederick or fight him to the death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the gap between them was huge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In terms of both numbers and strength, they were at an absolute disadvantage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone tentatively asked, "Frederick, I can swear by the Divine Principle that after leaving here, I will lead my sect to relocate from the Glorious Divine Kingdom. This way, my sect will no longer pose any threat to the Glorious Divine Kingdom."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Can you spare us?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick still sneered. "Of course not! Letting you leave and take your sect out of the Glorious Divine Kingdom? What if you turn to Evernight Court instead? Wouldn't that still threaten the Glorious Divine Kingdom?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Therefore, I&rsquo;ll say it again, don&rsquo;t hold onto any other illusions."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You only have two choices. If you choose to submit to me and become my most loyal subordinates, as long as you obey orders, I promise your lives will be better than before."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you choose to refuse me, then you can only die here. Your sect's power will also be destroyed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, you still have fifteen breaths to consider."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, everyone's expressions changed drastically again, filled with extreme conflict and hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Adriana was quickly communicating with Osborne. "Osborne, what should we do now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among everyone present, Osborne was the calmest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On one hand, he had long anticipated Frederick's actions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the other hand, it was because only he had other solutions here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Adriana's question, Osborne replied, "Don't panic, the situation hasn't reached the most critical point yet. Let's see how the others choose first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana said helplessly, "No matter what they choose, we&rsquo;ll still have to face Frederick in the end. I didn&rsquo;t expect so many people to have already sided with Frederick. If we really fight, I&rsquo;m afraid we won&rsquo;t last long."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if all these people resist and refuse to submit, we are still no match for him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded, "I know."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, we are not without a way out!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although the black vortex was in turmoil, temporarily preventing departure from Necropolis City, it wasn't much of a problem for Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He still had at least two options for retreat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The first option for retreat was to hide in the Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the opportunity gained from clearing the 27th floor, he could easily enter the Celestial Spire again for refuge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There, Frederick could never harm him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He only needed to wait ten days until Frederick and the others left, then calmly leave the Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, this retreat was only suitable for Osborne alone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Adriana, May, Clara, Leroy, and Casey could not enter the Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Osborne thought of a second plan, to enter the Eighth Skyfall Casket or the Seventh Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He possessed the keys to these two Skyfall Caskets.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Necropolis City was not without hiding places.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They only needed to open one of the Skyfall Caskets and hide inside, making it difficult for Frederick to kill them easily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as they stayed in the Skyfall Casket for ten days, the black vortex would calm down, and they could leave safely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this approach carried risks. If Frederick took the chance to enter the Skyfall Casket and used its opportunities to break through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, the consequences would be even more severe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne hesitated, unsure of what to do.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You have ten breaths left!" Frederick's voice suddenly turned cold. "When time's up, if you still refuse to submit, I will strike without hesitation, and you will surely die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he unleashed an even stronger killing intent and oppressive aura, sweeping across the scene, directly pressuring the more than twenty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors from various factions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, their foreheads were covered in sweat, and their expressions were filled with struggle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Eight!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Seven!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Six!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick's tone grew colder, his killing intent more intense, and the power around him surged continuously. The suffocating pressure of a Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness was overwhelming.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Behind him, over thirty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors, including Weston and Callista, also began to unleash their power, as if ready to act at any moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, someone could no longer bear the pressure. "I am willing to submit!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He doesn't want to die.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his view, opposing Frederick in Necropolis City was undoubtedly a path to self-destruction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he chose to submit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the first, there will be a second.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I submit!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I am willing to submit too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I submit!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In just a short moment, more than twenty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors chose to submit to Frederick for survival.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They respectfully walked behind Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick immediately laughed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, his gaze locked onto Adriana and May, who had yet to submit, as well as Osborne, Clara, Leroy, and Casey.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his eyes, the killing intent had reached its peak.</span></p><div class="pagination">
