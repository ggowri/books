  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were many people at the scene of the incident. Some people from the three ancient families learned the news that Yohan and Lauren were dead, and they all took boats to watch the fun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most boats were on the periphery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the core area, there was one large ship, and only the core senior members of the three ancient families could board this ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yohan and Lauren's cleft bodies were on the deck. Everyone looked at them, but no one dared to move rashly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac was the eldest master and the only Power Master of the Augustine family. He could board the ship and soon brought Osborne aboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the cleft bodies, he was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could this happen? Who did it?" he asked, looking at Shawn and Emery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emery looked at Isaac and shook his head, saying, "Isaac, you are here. We don't know who killed them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn looked at Isaac somewhat coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "We don't know who killed them, but they were killed just after leaving the Augustine Estate, and this place is the closest to the Augustine Estate. I'm afraid you can't elute the suspect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac became angry when he heard this. "Shawn, what do you mean? Are you saying that I killed them? Are you serious? I would never kill the two juniors!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn snorted, "You don't have to explain to me whether you did it or not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm curious about something. Isaac, why did you come so late? We all sensed the fluctuations of the battle. Can't you sense it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac said coldly, "I'm old, so what if I can't sense it? You suspect that I killed them just because of this! Humph, then I can suspect that someone from the Walker family killed them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The other Class A masters of the Walker family have not appeared yet. I suspect that they were the ones who killed the two people, and even Brad was killed. Only the Walker family has such strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn's face turned cold when he heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered, "Isaac, stop talking nonsense. The Paltrow family will figure out who did this. I have already contacted them, and they will be here soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Given their style, they will definitely not let the murderer go if they find out who killed their people. Be careful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Shawn looked disdainful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should be the one to be careful," Isaac snorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't bother to argue with Shawn and then went to check the bodies on the deck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac said, "Yohan and Lauren were killed by sharp weapons. The wounds on their bodies are too smooth. The murderer must be extremely powerful to cleave them in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The murderer should be a Class A martial master. Only a Class A martial master can kill them while fighting against Brad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Isaac smiled faintly and glanced at Shawn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emery looked at Shawn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn couldn't help but frown, not knowing what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew what Isaac and Emery meant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither the Augustine family nor the Marion family had a Class A martial master. The murderer was probably a Class A martial master, so Yohan and Lauren were definitely not killed by someone from the Augustine or Marion family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, the murderer could only be someone from the Walker family because it had several Class A martial masters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph!" Shawn snorted coldly. "It may not be done by a Class A martial master. The murderer may be a Class A Power Master. The Power Master can condense the strength into a sharp blade and can cause such a wound."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it?" Isaac smiled faintly and said nothing more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Anyway, it's not me. Everyone knows that I'm a fire elemental controlling metahuman. If I condense the fire elemental into a blade and cleave them, it will definitely leave large burn marks on their bodies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Emery frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a water elemental controlling metahuman. If he condensed the water elemental into a blade, he could cleave Yohan and Lauren's bodies without leaving any obvious marks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It wasn't me. I was the second one to get here," Emery explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surroundings became quiet. Shawn, Emery, and Isaac all wanted to put the suspicion of murder onto each other, but their attempts all failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, violent energy fluctuations were heard from afar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A ship came over quickly with the Paltrow family's lightning symbol on the flag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surrounding ships hurriedly made their way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the Paltrow family's ship arrived, and several people flew into the air and quickly landed on the big ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leading man was in his fifties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was Wade Paltrow, the eldest master of the Paltrow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He strode over and approached Yohan and Lauren's bodies. When he saw the bodies clearly, he became furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exuded an intense homicidal aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade said sternly, "Who did it? Who dared kill the younger generation of the Paltrow family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoever did it? Admit it right now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or I will kill everyone in your family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade said this with a livid face and glanced at the people around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he stared at Isaac with burning eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isaac, was it someone in your family who did this?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
