  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, Anastasia, why aren't you training? You don't have to stick around for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's nothing going on outside, and if something comes up, I'll call for you," Osborne said, ruffling her hair with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia returned his smile, but her expression quickly turned serious. "Osborne, there's something I need to tell you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprised, he raised an eyebrow. "Oh? What's on your mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you remember the Thundergod Gloves you gave me?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she pulled out one of the gloves, which shimmered with crackling lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight brought back a flood of memories for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, he had given her those gloves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne recalled the time he had attended Cuthbert's Honor Quest Ceremony in Tethynia, where he had defeated Cuthbert in a fierce battle. Unfortunately, that victory had drawn the attention of the Williamson family's Class S warrior, who chased him down, nearly killing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only thanks to Isa's sudden appearance that he had been saved from the Class S warrior's wrath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a twist of fate, the Class S warrior had offered the Thundergod Gloves to Osborne as compensation for the trouble caused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Thundergod Gloves were a top-grade divine artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had given them to Anastasia because he believed her lightning elemental power was stronger than his own, and he thought the gloves would enhance her abilities even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, with her current strength, the gloves had little impact on her power, and she hadn't used them in a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her take them out now surprised him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course I remember! Why bring it up now? It's not really useful to you anymore, is it? And I don't need it back!" Osborne assumed she was offering the gloves back to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anastasia shook her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's not what I wanted to discuss! Do you remember the legend surrounding the Thundergod Gloves? They say that the Thundergod Gloves and the Hammer of Thor are actually a pair! Long ago, the Hammer of Thor was lost, but anyone wearing the Thundergod Gloves who comes within a certain distance of it can sense its location..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, so you've sensed where the Hammer of Thor is?" Osborne asked, excitement bubbling up inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia nodded eagerly. "Exactly! After we arrived in Apocalypse City, the Thundergod Gloves suddenly started reacting!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I studied it for a while and discovered the signal is coming from the center of Apocalypse City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I suspect the Hammer of Thor is located right there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face hardened at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You mean&mdash;Apocalypse Island? The center of Apocalypse City is Apocalypse Island! And the Baxter family is the only one residing there! Are you saying the Hammer of Thor is with the Baxter family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia said, "It's very likely!" That's why I didn't rush back to training. I wanted to discuss how we should handle this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne fell deep into thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, he spoke up, "The Hammer of Thor is said to be the Ultimate divine artifact! Especially when paired with the Thundergod Gloves, its destructive power is said to be cataclysmic&mdash;far stronger than the Supreme Malevolence Sword!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, the Supreme Malevolence Sword is also an Ultimate divine artifact, but it's one of the weakest in that category. It pales in comparison to the Hammer of Thor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, if your lightning elemental power can synergize with the Hammer, its power could double! So, since we've finally sensed its location, we absolutely have to get our hands on it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But that's the Baxter family! Their strength is even greater than the Hudson family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They have Supernal Deity Kings!" Anastasia said, concern etched across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia understood all too well how significant the Hammer of Thor could be for her. In fact, she hadn't dared to tell Osborne that when she sensed its location, her body had trembled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt as if the Hammer was summoning her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had forced herself to rein in that excitement, resisting the impulse to rush straight to the Baxter family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression grew grim. "If the Hammer of Thor really is with the Baxter family, we need to be cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But don't worry; I'll make sure we get our hands on it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here's the plan, you go back to Hope Haven and focus on training! Right now, our biggest weakness is our low levels. You need to power up as quickly as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll head over to the Baxter family's place and assess the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I can retrieve the Hammer easily, that would be fantastic! But if it proves difficult, I won't act impulsively&mdash;I'll think of another way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia hesitated for a moment, then nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Osborne's abilities; sticking around with him would only be a hindrance. It made more sense to go train and elevate her level instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, just be careful," Anastasia urged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and ruffled her hair again, saying, "Don't worry about me! My strength might not be top-notch, but when it comes to escape tactics, I'm top-tier. Just wait for my good news!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia nodded and handed the Thundergod Gloves back to him before heading off to Hope Haven to focus on her training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting another moment, Osborne took the gloves and left the Pioneers of Starlight's base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His destination was clear, Apocalypse Island, home of the Baxter family!</span></p><div class="pagination">
