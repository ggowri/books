  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's head back!" Osborne said, breaking the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded in agreement. She didn't express her gratitude verbally; mere words felt insufficient. Instead, she tucked her appreciation deep into her heart, planning to repay him when the opportunity arose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two of them made their way back to the outpost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't until they reached the 53rd mining area that Osborne let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over the past fifteen days, they had trained directly beneath Divine Peak Nine without encountering any dangers or even a single Deathborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While this seemed fortunate, a nagging unease settled in Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He understood that in the territory of fierce beasts, small creatures dared not venture close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The absence of Deathborn right under Divine Peak Nine likely indicated that something far more terrifying lurked there, scaring the Deathborn away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thank goodness they had made it out without incident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I think we should avoid that place in the future," Osborne mused to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During their time training, while his main body focused on cultivation, six of his clones scoured the area for Ultimate Essence Crystals. What started with one clone searching quickly escalated into a full-scale operation, with all six clones combing through a radius of over six thousand miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The amount of Ultimate Essence Crystals he collected was staggering&mdash;so much that he couldn't even begin to calculate it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Definitely over 10 million! How many exactly? Who knows?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But I'd bet that the total amount of Ultimate Essence Crystals in the entire Eastern Ninth District doesn't even come close to what I've got," Osborne thought, a grin creeping onto his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Right now, I don't even need these Ultimate Essence Crystals, but soon enough, when my Satan's Eye breaks through to Level Ten, they'll come in handy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once it reaches Level Ten, my Infinite Devouring Eyes will undergo a transformation, becoming even stronger! As it stands, my Infinite Devouring Eyes can only absorb the ambient energy of the world. But once it evolves, it'll be able to devour the energy within Essence Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just imagine&mdash;if I feed my Infinite Devouring Eyes a mountain of Essence Crystals, my power will skyrocket!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What kind of level could I reach after absorbing over ten million Ultimate Essence Crystals? Breaking through to Deity King would be a piece of cake!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Excitement bubbled within Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He recalled how Diana had absorbed just two thousand Ultimate Essence Crystals to leap from early to late Deity Overlord. "What if she absorbed 20 million?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The thought sent chills down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was tempted to use the remaining core energy from the four Primordial Crimson Lotuses to rapidly elevate his Satan's Eye to Level Ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in the end, he held back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No rush! My advancement speed is already pretty solid; I just need a bit of time to stabilize my strength. As long as I don't run into a Deity King warrior, I should be more than fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that resolve, the duo left the 53rd mining area and soon returned to the outpost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before entering, Osborne used the Eclipsing Mantra to adjust both their realms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's rapid progress was impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If anyone discovered she was now at the late Deity Overlord stage, she would attract unwanted attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he modified her realm to the early Deity Overlord stage, while he adjusted his own to the mid-stage of Celestial Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he was indeed at the mid-stage, the faint golden glow flickering within his transparent Divine Flame was a bit peculiar, so he made sure to disguise that as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once everything was set, they stepped into the outpost together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's meet here in half a day and head out for Divine Peak Nine together!" Osborne proposed, and after agreeing on the plan, they parted ways for the time being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne discreetly inquired with Riley about any developments at the outpost during the past two weeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The report came back clear&mdash;everything was running smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, there had been a noticeable increase in the number of missions outside, with soldiers encountering Deathborn forces more frequently and suffering greater casualties than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aside from that, there were no significant incidents to report.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he compiled information from his Blood Clan operatives, Osborne made his way back to his quarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Divine Peak Nine outpost housed over 400 thousand soldiers, including more than two thousand who had been transformed into Blood Clan members by Osborne himself. They served as his eyes and ears, ensuring that even when he wasn't on-site, he remained well-informed about the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, there were certain confidential matters that even they couldn't sniff out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after Osborne returned to the outpost, Athena received her own set of news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A cold smile crept across her face. "So, he's finally back?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I was starting to think he'd be too scared to show his face again! And he even managed to break through to a higher realm? From early Celestial Deity to mid-Celestial Deity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Looks like he found a cozy spot to grind away at his training over the past two weeks. What a shame it won't do him any good; at Divine Peak Nine, he's just an insect! This time, I refuse to believe he'll make it back alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After her tirade, Athena turned to Edison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Uncle Edison, are we really going to follow Vice Commander Angelo Royston into the exploration of Divine Peak Nine?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
