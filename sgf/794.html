  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emi was incredibly strong. She had easily defeated numerous challengers, keeping many prodigies aiming for the Godson Rankings at bay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her strength was undeniable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But it all depended on who she was up against.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Compared to Cuthbert, though, Emi's power was insignificant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She couldn't even match Emma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's Death Realm withstood multiple attacks from Cuthbert and drained his life force, severely weakening him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emi wasn't capable of that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her Dark Realm couldn't hold against Cuthbert's terrifying power for long. It was quickly broken. After exhausting all her tactics, she only managed to survive five moves before being knocked off the stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seemed that even against elites from the Godson Rankings, Cuthbert still found victory relatively easy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, many of Cuthbert's family members were now frowning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anyone paying attention could see that Cuthbert's strength had been affected!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before his fight with Emma, Cuthbert would have only needed three moves, maybe even two, to defeat Emi.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, it had taken him five moves!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although five moves were still impressive, it had cost him more energy than it should have.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If every fight took him three extra moves to finish, the accumulated fatigue would catch up with Cuthbert quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Where he might have fought a hundred rounds before, now he might only manage eighty at most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This situation made the Williamson family's expressions grow serious and frustrated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert wasn't happy about it either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But there was no turning back now. If he had known how much Emma's Death Realm would drain him, he would have used his Domain and defeated her quickly without giving her any chance to attack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately, it was too late for that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had no choice but to continue fighting, taking things one match at a time and seeing how far he could go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, the next few battles weren't as troublesome. There were no unexpected factors like Emma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While he was burning through energy, it was still manageable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In my current state, a hundred straight wins is out of the question! I might not even make it to ninety! But eighty straight wins should still be within reach if I play it safe!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Eighty wins would still be impressive!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nearly a thousand people have held Honor Quest Ceremonies in the past two hundred years. Out of them, only sixty-three have achieved fifty straight wins, and fewer than twenty have made it to eighty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I can get to eighty straight wins, it'll be enough to bring honor to my name!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert lowered his expectations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eighty straight wins!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had to achieve this. If he could hit eighty wins, he would build enough confidence to break through the barrier of Class AAA and reach Class S, becoming a Supreme Overlord.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, eighty wins... I have to make it happen!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I can't, I might not break through to Class S this year. And if I can't even reach fifty wins, I might not advance for another five years!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert understood just how crucial this Honor Quest Ceremony was for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fight!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The battles continued, and Cuthbert remained dominant. One after another, the elites of the Godson Rankings fell to him as he racked up consecutive wins.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thirty-five straight wins.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Forty straight wins.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Forty-five straight wins.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, Cuthbert reached forty-five straight wins, nearing the milestone of fifty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fifty straight wins was a major milestone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Reaching fifty wins would make this Honor Quest Ceremony a tremendous success. The Williamson family would be honored, and Cuthbert's name would be etched into history.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But failing to reach fifty wins would be a failure, a humiliation for Cuthbert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert felt that he was still in decent shape, though his pace had slowed. His opponents were lasting longer in the fights.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Still, he felt he had stabilized the situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As long as nothing unexpected happened, eighty straight wins seemed well within his grasp!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Forty-six straight wins!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Forty-seven straight wins!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Get off the stage!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Forty-eight straight wins!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Break!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Forty-nine straight wins!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert soon reached forty-nine straight wins. His forty-ninth opponent had been ranked 466 on the Godson Rankings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was just one match away from reaching fifty wins.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A smile appeared on Cuthbert's face. One more victory, and he would reach fifty wins. In his current condition, there was no way he could lose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He waited for his next opponent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Osborne slowly stood up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Coincidentally or not, Osborne was ranked 465 on the Godson Rankings, making him Cuthbert's next opponent as he aimed for fifty wins.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne slowly walked toward the stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Cuthbert saw him, he froze for a moment, then a cold glint flashed in his eyes.</p><div class="pagination">
