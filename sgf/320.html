  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, at the Paltrow Estate, a young man and woman left by car, heading towards the Alisa Ship docked at Crescent Wharf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crescent Wharf was the largest port in Pinchide City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man and woman in the car </span><span>were </span><span>the best of the younger generation in the Paltrow family. The man was Yohan Paltrow, and the woman was Lauren Paltrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both were under thirty years old and had already become Class B+ metahumans for more than three years, making them experienced Class B+ metahumans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the younger generation of the Paltrow family, only Alexander </span><span>could </span><span>outshine them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They left the Paltrow Estate because they received an order from their young heir, Alexander</span><span>. They needed </span><span>to find Osborne and convey a message to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, </span><span>Yohan and Lauren </span><span>planned to go directly to the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, upon learning that Osborne would board the Alisa Ship tonight, they changed their plans and used the Paltrow family's connections to buy two tickets for the cruise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lauren, this task will be easy. We can enjoy a cruise while we're at it. I heard the Augustines' cruise route offers some very nice scenery," Yohan said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at Lauren in the passenger seat with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lauren, beautiful but stern-faced, as if everyone owed her a fortune, merely nodded in response to Yohan's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>" Osborne defeat</span><span>ed</span><span> Ryan</span><span>. He </span><span>must be quite </span><span>powerful</span><span>. You better not underestimate him. If we fail Mr. Paltrow, neither of us will be spared," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yohan snorted, "Defeating Ryan is nothing. That guy only knows how to manipulate gravity. As long as you avoid his gravity, he's nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, he just broke through to Class B+ while we've been at Class B+ for three years. Either of us can easily defeat Ryan.</span><span>" </span><span>As for Osborne? He'd better behave, or I'll </span><span>take</span><span> his head </span><span>off </span><span>and feed it to the sharks</span><span> without hesitation</span><span>.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Augustine family have long been in decline. Aside from those few old guys, the rest are trash! You won't need to lift a finger</span><span>. </span><span>I'll handle everything," Yohan said confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lauren frowned. "I'm telling you, be careful. Don't you find it strange? The Augustine family has faced so many problems at sea recently, yet Osborne still wants to set sail? Doesn't he fear for his safety?</span><span>"</span><span>"Either he is very confident or the Augustine family have arranged strong protection for him. Otherwise, he wouldn't be going to sea."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Yohan finally frowned but quickly shrugged it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It doesn't matter. Given the current situation of the Augustine family, would they dare provoke us? Once I reveal our identity, they'll be scared stiff.</span><span> </span><span>In any case, this will be a simple and enjoyable task," Yohan said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lauren, uninterested in further conversation, turned to look out the window, ignoring Yohan's arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, they arrived at Crescent Wharf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Alisa Ship docked at Crescent Wharf was already lit up, welcoming guests. It looked enormous and luxurious</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to Yohan and Lauren, it was nothing special.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They boarded discreetly and went to the fourteenth deck, a level reserved for VIPs, where tickets cost nearly a million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to Yohan and Lauren, it was nothing special.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As night fell, the Alisa Ship finally sounded its loud horn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was only half an hour left before the ship's departure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the not-so-numerous passengers had already boarded. Even Ophelia and Evelyn, who hurriedly arrived, had boarded and were on the thirteenth deck, closely watching the other floors, hoping to spot Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne had not yet boarded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His convoy finally arrived just as night fell, and the cruise ship was about to depart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, Yulissa, you need to head back now," Osborne said to Yulissa, who insisted on seeing him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa bit her lip. "I'm not going back. I want to go to </span><span>the </span><span>sea with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned. "You didn't say that before!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I told you beforehand, would you let me come? Now that we're here, you can't stop me. If you don't let </span><span>me</span><span> go with you, I'll take a small boat and follow you!" Yulissa said firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's frown deepened. "That's ridiculous! Do you know how dangerous this trip is? You're not strong enough to help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa looked up and met Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you think I'm just a kid, right? This trip is to investigate our father's death and the mastermind behind it. As his daughter, I must go with you.</span><span> </span><span>Besides, I'm not afraid of danger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed in exasperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, time is running out. If we don't board now, the ship will leave," Nathan interjected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan waited silently by the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hesitating for a moment, Osborne finally nodded. "Alright, you can come with us, but once we're on the ship, you must follow my orders completely!</span><span> </span><span>If you can do that, I'll let you come."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa's face lit up with joy, and she quickly nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it, Osborne. I'll do as you say."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wrapped her arms around Osborne's, acting all sweet and affectionate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed and waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, let's board the ship."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbeknownst to Osborne, everything was being watched from the thirteenth deck of the Alisa Ship, where Ophelia and Evelyn were observing the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Ophelia and Evelyn, who was on the thirteenth deck, had observed the whole scene. But Osborne didn&rsquo;t know it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the beautiful Yulissa clinging to Osborne's arm like a spoiled child, Ophelia's face turned deathly pale.</span></p><div class="pagination">
