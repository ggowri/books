  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the fox-tailed man finished speaking, Orson was taken aback, instantly shifting into his human form and standing alongside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stellan, you said that, not me! Let's be real&mdash;Alfred is from the Paramount Supreme Clan and one of the heirs of the Bowman family. If you call him a waste, just wait until the Paramount Supreme Clan hears about it. You'd better watch your back; they won't take it lightly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Orson's words, Stellan let out a derisive laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a super genius from the Snow Fox Clan, one of the top ten Upper Races, and he wore his pride like a badge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what if I said it? Alfred is a waste, plain and simple! Are we not allowed to speak the truth? Deep down, you think the same thing; you're just too scared to say it! Orson, I look down on you. Just because Alfred has the backing of the Paramount Supreme Clan, you're trembling in your boots? Ha! The folks from the Paramount Supreme Clan haven't even shown up yet, so what's there to fear?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orson frowned, choosing not to engage further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he shifted the topic. "I thought my speed was impressive, but it seems like there are a lot of people here. Looks like plenty of folks are after the Bowman family's rewards! But make no mistake, the reward will be mine! I'm going to take down the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stellan shrugged. "Most of these people are just here for the spectacle, hoping for a lucky break! The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings aren't exactly pushovers. The real challenge right now is finding them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before I arrived, I thought it would be easy to track them down, especially since everyone has top-tier Spirit Tracers. But it turns out the Spirit Tracers are practically useless! No one knows where the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings are hiding."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's definitely a problem! But remember, the Bowman family issued the Stellar Pursuit Mandate. As soon as they show their faces, they'll be spotted! We just need to be patient," Orson said with a frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two continued their casual conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, a few more super geniuses joined them&mdash;young warriors, who were well-acquainted with one another, all part of the elite of their generation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, far away at the Divine Peak Nine base, Osborne was informed of the situation in Wild Flame City through Darren and others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile crept across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? The Stellar Pursuit Mandate? So the various clan warriors are gathering in Wild Flame City? They think they can kill us or provide our location to the Bowman family in exchange for the Supreme Malevolence Sword and Shield, Celestial Crystals, or even the Miracle Elixir?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a shame&mdash;they're bound to be disappointed! First, we need to boost our strength. You guys just keep gathering more warriors!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Muttering to himself, Osborne returned to his training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Satan's Eye had absorbed the core energy of a Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, gaining a significant boost, but he still had a long way to go before breaking through to Level Ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just three more cores of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity! I hope Satan's Eye can reach Level Ten!" he thought, focusing intently on his cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kept a close watch on the outside world through Darren, Guy, and other Blood Clan descendants, ensuring he was always informed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time flew by swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in Hope Haven, Anastasia, Zoe, Bryce, Kendra, Mila, Diana, and Hannah were all experiencing rapid growth in their powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the endless supply of Celestial Crystals at their disposal, their potential and talents were steadily rising. Diana and Hannah were advancing even faster, quickly catching up to the others and reaching the peak of the Deity Overlord realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were on the verge of breaking through to become Deity Kings, but they chose to hold back, wanting to strengthen their Divine Bodies first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Currently, Anastasia's Divine Body was at the peak of Level Seven, while Mila's was at the mid-stage of Level Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe, Kendra, Bryce, Diana, and Hannah all had Divine Bodies at the peak of Level Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Except for Mila, the rest were waiting for their Divine Bodies to improve further before making the leap to Deity King. When the time came, their Divine Bodies would undergo another transformation, likely advancing to at least Level Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the realm of divine cultivation, the levels of Divine Bodies were categorized into distinct ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Level Seven Divine Body was known as the Solar Divine Body, while the Level Eight Divine Body was revered as the Galactic Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elusive Level Nine Divine Body was referred to as the Cosmic Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was important to note that the majority of Deity King warriors only boasted a Level Seven Divine Body. Taking even a small step beyond that was a daunting, if not impossible, challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those rare individuals who achieved a Galactic Divine Body were incredibly few.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of every 10 thousand Deity King warriors, it was a rare gem to find even a single one possessing a Level Eight Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the Cosmic Divine Body, that was practically a legend&mdash;only the formidable Lord Malevolence or the most powerful Deity King from the Human Community, the God of Night, were said to have attained such an esteemed level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, after becoming a Deity King, advancing to the next tier became profoundly challenging. The disparity in Divine Body levels played a significant role in determining the gap in strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stronger the Divine Body, the more formidable the warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these thoughts in mind, the group focused on enhancing their Divine Bodies as much as possible before attempting to break through to the Deity King realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first to break through was Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After absorbing a considerable amount of Celestial Crystals, his Level Six Divine Body finally shattered its limits and ascended to Level Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, no matter how many more Celestial Crystals he consumed afterward, his Divine Body refused to budge further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recognizing the moment had come, Bryce made the decision to push through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His breakthrough sent waves of energy rippling through Hope Haven, the walls vibrating and the air shimmering with power. The vastness of the space allowed for this magnificent display, and when the dust settled, Bryce stood transformed. His Divine Body now radiated with the strength of a Level Eight Galactic Divine Body, marking his official rise to the rank of Deity King.</span></p><div class="pagination">
