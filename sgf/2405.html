  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne actually found something in the magma pool that hadn't melted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But after taking a closer look, Osborne couldn't help but freeze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The object was rectangular, like a transparent coffin. What shocked Osborne the most was that there was someone inside the transparent coffin.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A completely naked woman was lying quietly in the transparent coffin, her eyes tightly closed. Her figure could only be described as perfect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But looking at her, Osborne couldn't muster a single wicked thought, as if any trace of evil intent would be a desecration to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What did you see?" Primordial asked curiously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial didn&rsquo;t have Satan's Eye and couldn&rsquo;t see through the magma pool. So, seeing Osborne's shocked expression, Primordial was very curious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and quickly recounted what he saw.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, Primordial was also stunned. "A transparent coffin? Someone inside the coffin? Her skin is dewy and glowing, looking alive? Her figure is perfect, making you afraid to desecrate her? Are you sure you&rsquo;re not seeing things?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded seriously. "I'm sure. Besides, the ocular energy of Satan's Eye can't retrieve it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said anxiously, "What are you waiting for? Hurry up and get it out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the scorching magma, an ordinary top-grade Sacred Artifact would surely melt, and even an Ultimate Sacred Artifact might not withstand it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But that transparent coffin hasn't melted, it must be something valuable. The woman inside the coffin is probably extraordinary too. You need to retrieve it so we can find out what's inside."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Primordial was very curious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. He felt that the woman in the coffin was still alive. If left alone, she might die soon.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wait for me." With that, Osborne jumped into the magma pool. Shortly after, he reappeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He waved his hand gently, and a transparent coffin appeared in front of him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial immediately flew over, carefully examining the transparent coffin and the perfectly naked woman inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a while, Primordial said, "By human standards, she is indeed beautiful and perfect. But to me, she looks quite strange."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes. "You're just a tree, you have no sense of aesthetics. Is this woman still alive?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial didn't argue with Osborne and examined carefully.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, his expression changed. "She doesn't belong to the Human Community but to the Angel Clan."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? Angel Clan?" Osborne looked at Primordial in surprise. "Are you sure? </span><span>Aren't</span><span> Angel Clan supposed to have wings? She clearly doesn't have wings."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial replied, "Who told you that the Angel Clan must have wings?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Members of the Angel Clan are divided into many types. Most of them have wings, and the number of wings is related to their strength. For example, an Angel Clan warrior at the Empyrean Sacredness level has eight pairs of wings, while a warrior at the Supernal Deity King level only has six pairs of wings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But there are some members of the Angel Clan who are born without wings. They are called Wingless Angels, considered outcasts within the Angel Clan and not acknowledged by them. However, they do belong to the Angel Clan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The woman in the coffin is a Wingless Angel."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wingless Angel?" Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "No wonder this woman is so unrealistically beautiful. Turns out, she's a member of the Angel Clan."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Angel Clan is an Apex Clan comparable to the Sacred Dragon Clan and Sacred Tiger Clan, and even more powerful than them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The men in the Angel Clan are handsome, and the women are beautiful&mdash;this is a well-known fact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Osborne's first time seeing a member of the Angel Clan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked, "So, is she really dead?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial shook his head. "I don't know. I can't sense her life force. Maybe her life force is being blocked by this transparent coffin. Or maybe she's already dead. Only by opening this transparent coffin can I find out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and tried to open the transparent coffin, but found it impossible. No matter how hard he tried, the coffin lid wouldn't budge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even when Osborne attacked with Sacred Power, he couldn't move the transparent coffin at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This transparent coffin has strong defenses," Osborne said, a bit unwilling to give up, quickly pulling out the Warfare Scythe. "Let's see if you're tougher or if my Warfare Scythe is sharper."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he prepared to forcibly open the transparent coffin with the Warfare Scythe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Primordial stopped Osborne. "Wait!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why are you in such a hurry? This transparent coffin is a treasure. If you forcefully break it, it'll be ruined."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne curiously asked, "What is this transparent coffin?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't know," Primordial said calmly. "But precisely because I don't know, I'm even more certain it's something valuable. Besides, something this sturdy is definitely not ordinary."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I suggest you don't rush to open it. Let's study it for a while first. The woman in the coffin has been soaking in the lava pool for who knows how long. If she's dead, then she's been dead for a long time. If she's still alive, this bit of time won't matter at all."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, her condition is a bit special; she can only survive with the help of this transparent coffin. If you destroy it, you'll be killing her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Maybe after some time, she'll open the transparent coffin herself and walk out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment, then nodded and said, "Alright. I won't take action for now; let's study it for a while first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne put away the transparent coffin along with the Wingless Angel inside, deciding to study it later when he had time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Seems like there's nothing else here. Should we leave? I..." Osborne suddenly sensed something as he spoke.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly looked up. Instantly, he saw a figure swiftly passing through the magma layer, approaching here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he saw the person's appearance clearly, Osborne was somewhat surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "As expected, we're not the only smart ones. Someone really came to Magma Devourer's lair to search for treasures. And that person is Brenda."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne used Satan's Eye to see Brenda approaching.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I need to hide first." Osborne quickly dove into the magma pool, stopping only after reaching a sufficient depth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Here, he could still observe Brenda using Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after, Brenda appeared in the lair, her face filled with excitement and thrill.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "I finally found it. Magma Devourer loves collecting all kinds of treasures. Anything stored in its lair must be extremely valuable. Let me see what's in its lair."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda looked at the lair. Then, her expression changed. "What? There's nothing here? How is that possible? No way!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her expression was terrible. Carefully observing the central spot, she said, "There used to be something here, but it was just taken away. There's still some aura left that doesn't belong to the Magma Devourer."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who took the treasures collected by the Magma Devourer before me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda angrily scanned the surroundings, finally looking at the magma pool. Suddenly, her eyes flashed with golden light. She activated the Golden Dragon Eye.</span></p><div class="pagination">
