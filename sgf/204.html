  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was hyped up. "If I had level three, even level four Devil's Light, even if I'm not Class B, I bet I could wipe out Class B, maybe even Class B plus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of Devil's Light had Osborne grinning from ear to ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, he believed that using Devil's Light for attack and defense was just the tip of the iceberg. There were way more tricks up Devil's Light's sleeve, waiting for Osborne to uncover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But right now, Osborne didn't have time to mess around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't keep merging lightning essence because Valentin was already on the ropes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin, after all, was just a martial artist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding his own against a metahuman like Apollo at the same level was already a big deal for Valentin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bloodied and battered, with cuts all over from the Wind Tornado, Valentin was a goner if nobody stepped in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo looked like a freaking war god.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was surrounded by this fierce Wind Tornado, blocking all of Valentin's attacks. Even bullets from a Class B sniper gun couldn't get through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And every punch he threw packed the power of the Wind Tornado, stronger than Valentin's natural brute strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Valentin's solid combat experience, using the tricky terrain to keep dancing around Apollo, he would've been toast ages ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everywhere the fight went, massive trees got snapped like twigs, like a prehistoric beast had stomped through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Up on the viewing platform, everyone's eyes were glued to Valentin and Apollo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew whoever won between Apollo and Valentin would seal the deal for this showdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Valentin's about to bite the dust."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is impressive, a Class B martial artist, to last this long against a Class B metahuman without bailing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like Chevalier Security's gonna take the win."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even though Skyefall Security's sniper is a beast, taking out most of Apollo's top guys. As long as Apollo's still kicking, Chevalier Security won't lose."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Snipers are useless in this kind of face-off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Skyefall Security's done for."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reps from all the old families, even top-tier big shots, were all thinking the same thing. Once Valentin went down, Apollo would crush the rest of Skyefall Security like bugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chevalier Security, though they took a beating, would still win this billion-dollar battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Chevalier, congrats."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Chevalier, your son is a total badass."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People were already starting to congratulate Derek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek smiled back, watching Apollo's fierce moves, feeling relieved and all smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo muttered, "Time to wrap this up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo erupted again. The Wind Tornado around him got even wilder, surging into his fists as he smashed them into Valentin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin hadn't seen this coming and couldn't hold up anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spewed blood, his body flying back, slamming into a tree and leaving a human-shaped dent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to crawl out, writhing in pain, but couldn't manage it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo sneered. "Valentin, you're finished. Now, say goodbye. After I kill you, I'll wipe out all your crew."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Apollo threw another punch, aiming for Valentin's helpless head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin's eyes filled with despair, thinking, "Am I gonna die? Damn, just a bit more, and it would've been five minutes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Apollo's attack was about to smash into Valentin's head, a weird red glow suddenly appeared in front of Valentin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This glow acted like a shield, perfectly blocking Apollo's attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Wind Tornado hit the red glow, which wobbled a bit before slowly fading away. At the same time, Apollo's Wind Tornado also vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin, unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell? Who did that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo was stunned and didn't know why his attack fizzled. He looked around, trying to spot who saved Valentin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he saw Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had been over three hundred feet away just a second ago, but now he was right in front of Valentin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin looked at Osborne, relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, you finally showed up. If you hadn't, I'd be dead meat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at the battered Valentin, feeling a chill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good thing I made it in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Valentin, you did great. Leave the rest to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll settle the score for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne turned to face Apollo, his eyes blazing with battle lust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apollo, let's dance."</span></p><div class="pagination">
