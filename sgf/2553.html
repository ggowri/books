  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne is confident that Clara and Leroy's strength will transform within ten days, becoming top contenders in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because he knows how powerful the effect of the Dragon Elixir is.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The effect of the Top-grade Dragon Elixir is comparable to the Elven Sacred Water, and Osborne's power surge began after consuming the Elven Sacred Water; otherwise, his elemental essence would hardly break through to the Sacredness Level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ten days, with a hundredfold Time Acceleration, equals nearly three years&mdash;enough time for Clara and Leroy to absorb a hundred drops of Top-grade Dragon Elixir and complete their transformation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, that's still not enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne also prepared Superior Sacred Artifacts and even Legendary Sacred Artifacts for them...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ensuring they won't lose to anyone in terms of weapons and equipment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In such a situation, those who look down on Clara and Leroy, thinking they are unworthy to represent Eastern Zone 3 in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, will surely be stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dragon Elixir?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy were a bit surprised at this moment. It wasn't until Osborne explained the effects to them that their eyes widened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This... this is too precious!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy didn't dare to take it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne forcibly handed it to them and said with a smile, "This is nothing to me, and I can't even use it all! Besides, I have an even more precious Legendary Dragon Elixir! However, you don't have that much time now. Save the Legendary Dragon Elixir for after the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne directly applied a hundredfold Time Acceleration in the room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He then took out some Legendary Sacred Artifacts and Superior Sacred Artifacts for Clara and Leroy to choose from.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy were stunned again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These are Superior Sacred Artifacts, even Legendary Sacred Artifacts!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the zone duel of Eastern Zone 3, Brenda gained overwhelming power with just one Legendary Sacred Artifact&mdash;the Ice Scepter. Yet now, Osborne placed twenty to thirty Legendary Sacred Artifacts in front of them, letting them choose freely!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Clara and Leroy were both shocked, clenching their teeth tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were deeply moved, not just by Osborne giving them these items, but even more by Osborne's trust in them...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He possessed so many Legendary Sacred Artifacts that, if the news got out, it would drive many people crazy with greed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne placed them directly in front of them, letting them choose&mdash;this was complete trust in them!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't be polite with me!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"These Legendary Sacred Artifacts were obtained by chance, and I have no use for them! Keeping them with me is pointless. Pick whatever you like!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Each of you must pick three!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, Clara and Leroy were stunned once again by his domineering words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They must pick three!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, Clara and Leroy exchanged a glance and didn&rsquo;t refuse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara chose a Legendary Sacred Artifact chain. She used to use a quasi-Sacred Artifact chain, but the gap between that and this Legendary Sacred Artifact chain was simply enormous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, she picked a melee Legendary Sacred Artifact dagger and a Legendary Sacred Artifact shield.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for Leroy, he chose a spear and a shield.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They are all Legendary Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, she stared at a Legendary Sacred Artifact bow, hesitating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, don't you use this bow yourself?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I remember your Bloodwrought Bow is just an Inferior Sacred Artifact, right? If you want to use this Legendary Sacred Artifact bow yourself, I'll pick another one."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, upon hearing this, picked up the Legendary Sacred Artifact bow and handed it directly to Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You use it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm already used to the Bloodwrought Bow, and only when using it can my strength fully unleash! This Legendary Sacred Artifact bow, though more powerful, feels unfamiliar to me and is actually less effective than the Bloodwrought Bow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides, my Bloodwrought Bow is no longer an Inferior Sacred Artifact but a Superior Sacred Artifact now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Leroy widened his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, not only has the Bloodwrought Bow been upgraded to a Superior Sacred Artifact, but the Warfare Scythe, Warfare Shield, and Solar Battleship have also been upgraded to Superior Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although their levels are not high, they are the ones Osborne is most comfortable with and can best showcase his strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, even though Osborne has numerous Legendary Sacred Artifacts and even Supreme Sacred Artifacts...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He never considered changing weapons.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Osborne's view, there is no strongest Sacred Artifact, only the strongest person!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A Sacred Artifact just needs to feel right!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, if the level is too low, that won&rsquo;t work. Fortunately, Osborne has the Warfare Ancient Tree, which can continuously upgrade the Bloodwrought Bow and Warfare Scythe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, it's time for you to go into seclusion!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Remember, you have nearly three years! During these three years, you must not only fully absorb the power of a hundred drops of Top-grade Dragon Elixir but also take this opportunity to completely master your Legendary Sacred Artifact!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Under normal circumstances, with your cultivation level, it's hard to unleash the power of a Legendary Sacred Artifact, but with the Dragon Elixir helping you enter the Enlightenment State, it should be possible!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I look forward to seeing your transformation in strength after three years!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne walked out of the room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now his strength has reached its limit. Unless he obtains a treasure like the Perfect Dragon Elixir, it will be difficult for him to improve further before breaking through his cultivation level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Osborne didn&rsquo;t waste time on seclusion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He walked out of the hotel and strolled around the Inner City of Nebula City. Comparing it with his memories, Osborne found that not much had changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He walked down a street, and memories from his past life suddenly surfaced in his mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, he was still young. Vivienne secretly took him out of the Palace, holding his hand as they walked down this street. She bought him his favorite toys and his favorite food.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back then, he understood nothing and thought life was all happiness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, just as they were about to return, a group of people stopped them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A noblewoman, surrounded by people, walked up to them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, the noblewoman mercilessly slapped Vivienne hard across the face, sending her flying, blood trickling from the corner of her mouth...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was terrified. To protect Vivienne, he lunged at the noblewoman but was knocked down by the two youths beside her, who grabbed him by the neck and slapped him...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was the first time Osborne felt pain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was also the beginning of Osborne being humiliated, beaten, and tortured...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And that noblewoman, she was the queen of Glorious Divine Kingdom!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Crown Prince Weston&rsquo;s mother&mdash;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista Augustine!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And those two who beat him, the boy and the girl, were Crown Prince Weston&rsquo;s younger brother and sister.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One was named Lorenzo Augustine, and the other Lilith Augustine!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was also the first time young Osborne understood what 'hatred' was. In the years that followed, Lorenzo and Lilith repeatedly caused him trouble, beat him, tormented him, and humiliated him countless times!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They called Osborne a bastard!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They insulted Osborne's mother, calling her shameless for seducing their father while being just a maid!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They said Osborne's lowly bloodline tainted the royal bloodline of the Glorious Divine Kingdom!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne tried hard to recall, his tragic life in the previous life was all caused by Callista! Everything started with Lorenzo and Lilith...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Callista! Lorenzo, Lilith..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stared blankly at the street, his eyes turning blood-red, hatred and killing intent almost igniting his entire body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His hatred for these three surpassed even his hatred for Brent!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Second only to his father king&mdash;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Glorious Divine Emperor, Frederick!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ten more days... just you wait!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Muttering those words, Osborne returned to the hotel, patiently waiting for time to pass.</span></p><div class="pagination">
