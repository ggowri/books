  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With General Ian Augustine's strength, he can definitely find out who killed the Magma Devourer! No matter how well that being hides, as long as they&rsquo;ve moved on this Abyssal Planet, they&rsquo;re bound to leave traces, which General Ian Augustine will pinpoint!" Gerald murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He shook his head, stopped overthinking, and ordered, "Let's go. It's time for us to head back! The contestants have all gathered near the Cosmic Translocator. We should also return and see who will stand out!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This time's zone duel had too many unexpected events, causing us to be constantly battling the Magma Devourer, leaving no time to focus on the contestants' situations."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We have no idea who will win the championship."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, a referee said, "The champion must be Brenda! Her biggest rival, Valentino, was killed by the Magma Devourer on the second day of the zone duel."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, she united almost all the contestants to jointly resist the attacks of the Native Creatures on Abyssal Planet, gaining a massive amount of resources."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Rumor has it, she even possesses a Legendary Sacred Artifact!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's a Legendary Sacred Artifact. Mr. Norton, even though you've reached Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, you don't have one! Brenda is just a disciple below Empyrean Sacredness, yet Skyearth Dominion granted her a Legendary Sacred Artifact. It's truly enviable."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald couldn't help but smile wryly upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, even though I've reached Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, in terms of talent and potential, I can't compare to Brenda at all! Skyearth Dominion is one of the strongest First-rate Powers, wealthy and generous. It's normal for them to give Brenda a Legendary Sacred Artifact. Envy is useless!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, envy is useless! Mr. Norton, if you had a Legendary Sacred Artifact, dealing with the Magma Devourer wouldn't have been so difficult, and so many comrades wouldn't have died."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Forget it, let's not talk about these upsetting things!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Anyway, this time in the Eastern Zone 3 zone duel, Brenda is definitely the champion! With her strength, even if she participates in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel six months later, she'll surely perform well and bring glory to our Eastern Zone 3!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The key now is who will take second and third place."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Exactly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald listened to everyone's discussion, shook his head, and said, "You're too optimistic! I agree that Brenda can win the zone duel, but for her to achieve good results in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel and bring glory to Eastern Zone 3, that's way too difficult!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's almost impossible!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald's words left all the judges stunned, looking at him in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Norton, why do you say that? Brenda's strength is just below Empyrean Sacredness. She's almost the strongest, right? Plus, she has the Legendary Sacred Artifact, the Ice Scepter. The geniuses selected from the other nine zones are at most on the same cultivation level as her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With Brenda's strength, even if she can't win the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, she can at least make it to the top ten, maybe even compete for the top five or top three."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone looked at Gerald in confusion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald sneered, "Brenda's strength is below Empyrean Sacredness. Is she the strongest? Not necessarily! This world is unfair. Sometimes, your greatest achievement is merely someone else's starting point!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This time, the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel is different from before!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the past, the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel selected the ten strongest geniuses from each region, with a total of one hundred top talents competing. Under such rules, Brenda had a great chance of making it to the top ten, maybe even competing for the top five or top three!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But I heard news that the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, the Augustine family, will also participate in this year's Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel! Moreover, both the main bloodline and branch bloodline geniuses of the Augustine family will join!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even princes and princesses will participate!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald's words left all the judges stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Will members of the Royal Family also send participants to the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even princes and princesses will participate? Mr. Norton, are you referring to the sons and daughters of the Glorious Divine Emperor?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the Glorious Divine Kingdom, who else but the children of the Glorious Divine Emperor would dare to be called princes and princesses? Of course, it's them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"For tens of thousands of years, the Glorious Divine Emperor has had over a hundred princes and princesses, most of whom have become Empyrean Sacredness warriors! Among them, the strongest Crown Prince, Second Prince, and Grand Princess have even surpassed Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection. Their strength rivals that of the Glorious Divine Emperor!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But there are still over a dozen princes and princesses who haven't broken through to Empyrean Sacredness! And in today's Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, at least several princes and princesses will participate!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Their strength is nothing Brenda can compare to!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald looked serious. "Do you think Brenda is strong? As a prodigy of a First-rate Power, she is indeed strong and never lacks resources! But compared to the princes and princesses of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, she is nothing!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even at the same cultivation level, any prince or princess of the Glorious Divine Kingdom could easily defeat Brenda, even if she has a Legendary Sacred Artifact&mdash;it wouldn't matter!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Because what Brenda has, they have too, and even more! But what they have, she may not have!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This will be an unfair fight."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The top three of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel will undoubtedly be taken by the princes and princesses! As for what rank others can achieve, it depends on how many princes and princesses participate!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If five princes and princesses participate, then others can only compete for sixth place! If ten princes and princesses participate, then others can only compete for eleventh place!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I am absolutely certain about this!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Gerald finished speaking, the other judges were completely stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are the princes and princesses of the Glorious Divine Kingdom really that powerful? I can hardly imagine it. We're all Ascension Ten Supernal Deity Kings, none of us have reached Empyrean Sacredness yet. Could there really be such a big gap in our strength?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald sneered, "Don't worry. The Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel will definitely be broadcasted live in every major city! By then, you'll see for yourself just how powerful the princes and princesses of the Glorious Divine Kingdom really are!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You don't understand simply because you've never seen them in action!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A judge curiously asked, "Mr. Norton, how do you know so much? Have you seen the princes and princesses in action?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He replied solemnly, "I have indeed seen them! Moreover, I witnessed two princes and three princesses in action. They are all Ascension Ten Supernal Deity Kings! At that time, they were sparring with someone, and their opponent was a mid Empyrean Sacredness warrior..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King sparring with a mid Empyrean Sacredness?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The judges exclaimed, "What was the final result? How long could they hold on?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald heard this and said, "Take a guess."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A judge pondered, "An ordinary Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King would definitely be defeated instantly by a mid Empyrean Sacredness warrior. The gap is too vast. There's simply no comparison! If it's a prodigy like Brenda, she might be able to defeat an ordinary primary Empyrean Sacredness warrior and, with a powerful Sacred Artifact, withstand a few moves from a mid Empyrean Sacredness warrior!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But in the end, she would still be defeated by a mid Empyrean Sacredness warrior within a minute!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So I guess the princes and princesses lasted around three minutes, maybe even longer..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That judge looked confident.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald sneered, "You guessed the time right, but you got the outcome wrong!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Two princes and one princess defeated the mid Empyrean Sacredness warrior in about three minutes!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
