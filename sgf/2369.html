  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, the incredibly powerful bright green light from the Elven Mother Tree instantly reached Isidore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isidore's expression changed drastically. He dared not be careless and resisted with all his might.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he was still knocked away, and his face instantly turned slightly pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it!" Isidore roared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glared angrily at the Elven Mother Tree. At this moment, three figures on the Elven Mother Tree were staring at him coldly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those three were Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Isidore, your plan has failed. We have already merged with the Elven Mother Tree. From now on, Elf City is no longer under your control," Uriah said coldly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isidore glared angrily at Uriah and said, "Uriah, you're courting death. Do you think forcibly merging with the Elven Mother Tree will allow you to defeat me? You're too naive. The Elven Mother Tree is at its weakest right now, and none of you three are suitable for merging with it. Even if you force the fusion, you can't unleash the full power of the Elven Mother Tree."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can still kill you and forcibly expel you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Uriah smiled and said, "Isidore, you're right. With the strength and condition of the three of us, even if we forcibly merge with the Elven Mother Tree, we can't defeat you. </span><span>However, if the three of us focus solely on defense, there's no way you can kill us in a short time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At least for the next three years, you won't be able to harm us. And after three years, the Elven Mother Tree might have overcome its weakness. Even if not, there could be new changes by then."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In short, you can't harm us or the Elven Mother Tree in the short term. The three of us will fight you here to the end. As long as we live, your plan will never succeed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Isidore fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew Uriah was right. If the three of them focused solely on defense, with his current strength, he couldn't kill them at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least, he couldn't do it within three years. This would delay his plan by another three years.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Isidore quickly regained his composure and sneered, "Three years mean nothing. For me, three years will pass in the blink of an eye. After three years, I will personally kill the three of you. By then, no one can stop me from merging with the Elven Mother Tree."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In three years, the Elven Mother Tree won't recover. So, the Elven Mother Tree will ultimately be mine. You can't stop me. No one can stop me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Isidore finished speaking, Uriah fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a long time, he snorted coldly and said, "Then we'll see. Let's find out in three years whether you kill us and merge with the Elven Mother Tree, or we kill you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Uriah looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, a bright green light shot into the sky, directly breaking through the defensive shield around Elf City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Uriah's voice echoed in Osborne's mind. "Osborne, we have already merged with the Elven Mother Tree. You don't need to worry about our safety anymore. Now, I have used the power of the Elven Mother Tree to open a passage out of Elf City. Leave quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you for everything you've done for our family. Without you, we couldn't have merged with the Elven Mother Tree and might have even died. Thank you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This Elven Sacred Water from the Elven Mother Tree is my gift to you. I hope you won't mind, as it's the only thing I can offer right now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, a transparent bottle appeared in front of Osborne. The bottle contained a clear liquid, exuding an incredibly rich aura of Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is the Elven Sacred Water of the Elven Mother Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't know its exact effects, but he knew it was valuable, so he quickly put it away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said to Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood, "Mr. Rivera, Mrs. Rivera, Sherwood, please rest assured. I will not forget my promise. Stay here and wait for me. Within three years, I will return here with Alfreda to rescue you and completely kill Isidore. This is my promise to you, from me, Osborne."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne spoke seriously, Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood all smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Uriah said, "If you're not confident, don't risk coming back. For us, Alfreda being alive is more important. If you're not sure you can defeat Isidore, then don't return."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment, then nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Uriah continued, "Go now. The Elven Mother Tree's power is still weak and can't sustain this passage for long. If you don't leave soon, there will be trouble."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded again. "Alright. You must wait for me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne put away the Ascending Sacred Sanctum. The Warfare Ancient Tree also disappeared from the spot, returning to Osborne's Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took a deep look at Isidore, then flew into the sky.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn kid, stop! Leave the Ascending Sacred Sanctum behind." Seeing Osborne about to leave, Isidore became furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He frantically tried to stop Osborne from leaving, but was blocked by the emerald green light, unable to get close to Osborne's body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isidore roared in anger, helplessly watching Osborne swiftly pass through the emerald energy channel and disappear from his sight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the void, Osborne's voice echoed. "Isidore, just wait and see. I'll come for you soon to settle our grudge."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the voice faded, Osborne disappeared as well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isidore was helpless and could only glare angrily at Uriah.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He roared madly, "Uriah, you're dead! From now on, seal off Elf City. No one is allowed to enter or leave Elf City. All warriors at Empyrean Sacredness will take turns attacking the Elven Mother Tree. Once we exhaust the power of the Elven Mother Tree, we can kill them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, the attack began. Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood exchanged glances. They didn&rsquo;t fight back but relied on the power of the Elven Mother Tree for defense, as it was the only way to hold out longer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Uriah murmured, "I hope that three years from now, Osborne can truly bring Alfreda back to change all this."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne had already left Elf City. He quickly altered his aura and appearance, then summoned the Solar Battleship and headed to where Agatha was.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This trip to Elf City was too dangerous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He almost ended up staying in Elf City forever, killed by Isidore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, he gained a lot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least, he confirmed that Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood were still alive and rescued them from Isidore's prison.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he didn't completely rescue them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood were forced to merge with the Elven Mother Tree, but they could only last for three years.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Three years! Within three years, I will resurrect Alfreda, bring her back to Elf City, completely change the situation in Elf City, and kill Isidore," Osborne silently vowed in his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly found Agatha and handed the Sublime Concealment Orb to her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, "Let's go. It's time for us to return to Racial Convergence Planet. In just over two months, the zone duel will begin. I need to go back and train properly to prepare for the zone duel."</span></p><div class="pagination">
