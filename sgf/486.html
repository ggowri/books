  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wallace's face immediately turned icy as he looked at the just-extinguished flames and the ashes of bodies strewn about. His gaze changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Osborne, his face full of murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daring to kill all the members of the Hummingbird Gang? Didn't you know the Hummingbird Gang are the lapdogs of our Luther family? Since you've killed the Hummingbird Gang members, I can only kill you all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he cracked his neck, fearlessly advancing towards Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was wearing a mask, so Wallace didn't recognize him, which was why he was unafraid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, he knew everyone stronger than him. Since he didn't realize Osborne, there was only one reason&mdash;Osborne wasn't worth his recognition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why would he care about someone like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wallace was very arrogant, which was why he came alone. Among the younger generation in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, his strength was second only to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he believed Osborne would surely fear him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at the arrogance on Wallace's face and couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you laughing at? Want to die faster?" Wallace said with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter who you are, you're dead today! I guarantee it. In </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, no one can save the person I want to kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Wallace prepared to launch an attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that moment, Osborne slowly took off the mask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said indifferently, "Wallace, are you sure you want to kill me? Are you sure no one in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> can save the person you want to kill?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that's the case, go ahead. I'm standing here not moving. Try to kill me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Wallace with a cold sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wallace's hand abruptly stopped in mid-air. He looked at Osborne's face, instantly stunned. Cold sweat immediately slid down his forehead, and his eyes were filled with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You, you're Osborne? How could you be Osborne? Weren't you supposed to be at the Augustine Estate?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he said this, Wallace suddenly covered his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled mockingly, confirming that the Luther family indeed had people </span><span>watching him, but none of that mattered now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked step by step towards Wallace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I am Osborne! I killed the people from the Hummingbird Gang. Now I'm giving you the chance to kill me and avenge them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wallace was even more terrified upon hearing that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Osborne approach step by step, he unconsciously retreated, his face pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Osborne gave him the chance, he dared not kill him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who was Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps many upper </span><span>class</span><span> in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> had not known Osborne a few days ago, but everyone knew him now because Osborne killed Alexander!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only Alexander but also Robert, Wade, and even all the Class B and above experts of the entire Paltrow family were killed by Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a woman, Osborne annihilated the Paltrow family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of that, Wallace suddenly looked at Clarissa again and shuddered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you Clarissa, the </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span> of the Radcliffe family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Osborne had revealed his identity, Clarissa did not hide anymore. She also took off the </span><span>skinmask</span><span>, revealing her flawless face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her face was icy at the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I am Clarissa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wallace </span><span>gasped,</span><span> his face even paler. He said quickly, "Osborne, Clarissa, it's all a misunderstanding! Everything is a misunderstanding! Our Luther family has nothing to do with the Hummingbird Gang. Their life and death have nothing to do with me. I just came here for a walk. I'm leaving now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he wanted to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, "Did I say you could leave? If you dare to move, I'll break your limbs first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wallace stopped immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was uncertain, but in the end, he showed a flattering smile. "Osborne, our Luther family seems to have no grudge against you. Today's matter is our fault. We'll compensate you. You can ask for anything, and I won't refuse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said with a smile, "Really? Do you really think we have no grudge?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to mention the Ghost Ship incident, but after thinking about it, he held back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said indifferently, "Perhaps we didn't have a grudge before, but now we do! The Hummingbird Gang you supported dared to shoot at me. I am very angry now! So, please come with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wallace gritted his teeth and said, "Osborne, is there no room for negotiation? I am the heir of the Luther family. Do you want to go to war with the Luther family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"War? So what? Anyway, I will count down from three. You can suffer less if you surrender voluntarily! I will naturally let you go when the Luther family gives me enough compensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, I will have to take action myself. Don't blame me if I hit you too hard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Wallace's anger, he was still panicked and struggling in Osborne's cold countdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a proud person. How could he surrender? He wouldn't put aside his dignity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne finished the countdown calmly. "Seems you won't surrender. In that case, I can only take action."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne flashed, already in front of Wallace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He punched out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a bang and crackles, Wallace's ribs broke instantly, and his body was thrown flying heavily.</span></p><div class="pagination">
