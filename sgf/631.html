I will become stronger as soon as possible. If they are still alive, I will find them! If they are dead...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, I will kill all those who harmed them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying this, he was filled with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather smiled and looked at Osborne with tears in his eyes and satisfaction on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very good. I feel relieved as you say this. Even if I die, I won't have to feel so regretful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Osborne frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Godfather did not give him another chance to speak and said, "Alright, I will prepare to go. The attack from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> should be starting soon, and the selection of the Augustine family's heir has officially begun. I will wait for you to overcome all competitors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will wait for you to take the Godfather's scepter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying that he waved the gold scepter in his hand, and his body disappeared the next second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Godfather's Scepter?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll get it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he went downstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, the sun in the sky was slowly rising.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Osborne had met the Godfather, he decided to return to </span><span>Dampston</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> might start a war at any time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He not only needed to withstand the attacks from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> but also protected all the people he cared about. Additionally, Osborne must surpass all competitors in the selection of the Augustine family's heir and secure the first position!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was difficult, but Osborne was not afraid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after, he boarded a plane bound for </span><span>Dampston</span><span> along with more than 30 members from the branch bloodline of </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, including Isaac, Nathan, and others. Accompanying them were two elders, Caleb and Janet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The plane flew across the sky and quickly headed towards </span><span>Dampston</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, there were 12 provinces in total where the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> was most likely to launch an attack. </span><span>Oillpuee</span><span> was one of them, and it was one of the six coastal provinces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was adjacent to </span><span>Dampston</span><span> and was located to the west of </span><span>Dampston</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The defense of </span><span>Oillpuee</span><span> was under Lance's charge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Lance and his men had already arrived at the </span><span>Oillpuee</span><span> headquarters of the Draco Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A large number of masters gathered at the branch bloodlines of </span><span>Yalynch</span><span>, Marcelin, and Ransford. They opened the map projection and marked out all the important </span><span>industries in the two provinces they were responsible for guarding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lance Augustine, we are responsible for guarding </span><span>Oillpuee</span><span> and </span><span>Rihilleo</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Among them, </span><span>Oillpuee</span><span>, located near the coast, is undoubtedly the primary target for the initial attack by the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>. Within </span><span>Oillpuee</span><span>, the Draco Group has a total of ten crucial industries that we must defend. If any of these ten industries are breached by the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, we will incur point deductions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man named Scott Collins, and sporting glasses pointed to a red dot on the map.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is where we are now, the </span><span>Oillpuee</span><span> Headquarters of the Draco Group. It is located on the edge of </span><span>Tageoair</span><span>, so this is the focus of our defense. We must defend it at all costs. Otherwise, we will lose 1,000 points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"According to the rules, if we kill a member of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> below Class A, we can only get one point. If we kill a Class A master, we can only get ten points. If we kill a Class A+ master, we can only get 30 points. If we kill a Class AA master, we can only get 100 points. If we kill a Class AAA master, we can only get 1,000 points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That is to say, if we lose the </span><span>Oillpuee</span><span> Headquarters, we will need to kill 1,000 ordinary members of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> or kill 100 Class A masters of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> to earn back 1,000 points that were deducted!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, we must not lose the </span><span>Oillpuee</span><span> Headquarters! We must leave a large number of masters behind to ensure the absolute safety of this place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scott finished speaking, and everyone nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lance also nodded. "That's right! The </span><span>Oillpuee</span><span> Headquarters must be defended. Otherwise, we will be deducted 1,000 points, and it will be difficult for me to compete with other prospective heirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, other industries cannot be abandoned."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scott nodded and pointed to three blue dots on the map.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These three blue dots represent the three rare metal mining areas owned by the Draco Group, which are also highly significant. If they are breached by the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, we will lose 500 points for each location. If all three places are breached, we will have a total deduction of 1,500 points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The rare metal mining areas are the focus of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' attack. We cannot lose these three places either, so we must send enough masters to guard them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lance nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Scott pointed to the remaining six green dots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In comparison, these six industries are not as crucial. Even if they are seized and occupied by the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, each location will only deduct 100 points from us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I suggest giving up the defense of these two places!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our strength is not the strongest, so we must make choices. Although giving up these six places will result in a deduction of 600 points, we can save more powerful individuals to protect our headquarters and the more important rare metal mining areas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the later stage, if we still have the strength to spare, we can definitely take these six properties back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Scott finished speaking, Lance nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay! Let's do it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone immediately divides into four groups to protect the </span><span>Oillpuee</span><span> Headquarters, three rare metal mining areas, and the </span><span>Rihilleo</span><span> Headquarters!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, let's all work together and do something great!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I become the heir of the Augustine family, everyone will receive sufficient benefits!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying that Lance was full of fighting spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, a person rushed in in a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lance Augustine, something terrible has happened!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> launched an attack on one of our rare metal mining areas! Our mining area had almost no resistance, and everyone died!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have lost a rare metal mining area!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
