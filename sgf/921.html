  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dark Realm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Solar Realm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plant Realm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three powerful realms instantly enveloped Osborne, unleashing a torrent of terrifying attacks that surged toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne felt like a tiny boat tossed about in a raging sea, on the verge of capsizing under the relentless assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grunted, shaking off his hesitation. With determination, he unleashed his own Light Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Realm had reached Level Four, surpassing the levels of Bradley, Scarlett, and Marlon. In a fair one-on-one matchup, he could easily shatter their realms&mdash;after all, theirs were still stuck at Level Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A little exertion on his part would do the trick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But unfortunately for Osborne, the trio had no intention of making this a fair fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their Realms, under their precise control, were fully interconnected, amplifying their combined strength as they aimed to counter Osborne's Light Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with his Level Four Realm, Osborne found himself at a disadvantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon's voice cut through the chaos, his eyes burning with hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you're dead meat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today's the day you meet your end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon gripped a divine artifact staff that radiated a menacing glow. It was at least a Premium divine artifact, enhancing his already formidable power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Merging seamlessly with the solar orbs, he waved his staff, sending the orbs crashing down toward Osborne with terrifying force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bradley, wielding a divine artifact sword, unleashed a wave of deadly black sword light, charging straight at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the most bizarre presence was Scarlett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a seasoned assassin, she didn't bother with stealth this time; she knew it would be useless within Osborne's Light Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, she was wrapped in thick vines, resembling a giant made of plants. In her hands, Scarlett wielded a massive whip, which was seemingly woven from roots, stretching over hundreds of yards long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The colossal whip swung toward Osborne with overwhelming might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne's expression turned grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them&mdash;Bradley, Scarlett, and Marlon&mdash;was a top-tier Class AAA powerhouse. Even in a one-on-one duel in the arena, they could hold their own against him for a considerable time, draining his energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with their combined forces and the boost from their divine artifacts, the pressure on Osborne was immense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he stood unyielding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think you can kill me? You're just a bunch of has-beens! Even united, you can't take me down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Destruction Orbs!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Disintegration Rays!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Osborne unleashed his most powerful techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless beams of light cascaded down, and terrifying rays shot outward, instantly shattering Marlon's solar orbs, dissolving Bradley's sword light, and tearing Scarlett's massive whip to shreds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the onslaught didn't stop there; the destructive light and rays continued their relentless assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them paled, scrambling to channel their strength just to fend off the incoming barrage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they could catch their breath, Osborne's attacks came crashing down again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within the Light Realm, he was unfazed by energy consumption. Endless Destruction Orbs and Disintegration Rays surged toward the trio like a tidal wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just the three of you think you can gang up on me? Talk about delusional!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's gaze was fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trio's faces darkened. They had assumed that leaving the arena would level the playing field, allowing them to fully utilize their divine artifacts and fight without restraint. They believed that together, they could finally defeat Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead, they found the gap between them and Osborne had widened even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlett exclaimed urgently, "We have to shatter his Realm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His Light Realm has reached Level Four. It's just too powerful! In there, we stand no chance against him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's strike together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trio quickly shifted their focus from Osborne to the formidable Light Realm itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A series of terrifying attacks rained down on the Light Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Realm shook violently but held firm, as solid as iron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of this made the three of them even more grim-faced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked. "I don't have time to waste on you. You'd be better off dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he grasped the Goddess of Grain's scythe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he appeared next to Bradley, delivering a powerful kick that sent Bradley flying. Before he could regain his footing, Osborne was already on him, swinging the scythe toward Bradley's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic flashed across Bradley's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help me!" Bradley shouted desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his allies were too late to react. All he could do was raise his divine artifact sword to defend himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, the sharp edge of the Goddess of Grain's scythe cleaved right through his longsword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bradley's eyes went wide with disbelief and terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "My sword is a Premium divine artifact! How could it be cut down so easily?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
