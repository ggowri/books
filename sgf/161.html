  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa clung tightly to Osborne, releasing all the pent-up despair she had been feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood still, his body tense, his heart racing as he inhaled Clarissa's unique scent. His face flushed, and he gently patted her back after a moment of hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay now." He reassured her. "With me here, no one can hurt you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa trembled at his words, and she hugged him even tighter. "Osborne, please save Aunt Donna and Barlyn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, his voice firm. "Don't worry. With me here, they'll be safe too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then turned his gaze to Hammond. Among all the enemies present, Hammond seemed the most formidable. His power was likely on par with Raymond's, both being top-tier Class C+ metahumans. Hammond's power was wood-based.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Osborne had easily defeated Raymond before, he knew he couldn't afford to be complacent against Hammond. His previous victory had involved transforming into a vampire, a trump card he couldn't reveal in front of so many people. Even using lightning power publicly was out of the question. Beating Hammond with only his natural abilities would be challenging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, you're still alive?" Hammond roared. "Where's Raymond? Has he really betrayed the King of the Aberrants? Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes flickered with a hint of cunning as he responded with a faint smile, "Yes, Raymond has defected. He's hidden nearby. If you try anything, he'll join me in taking you down. Surrendering and switching sides is your only way out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hammond's face darkened at Osborne's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna and the others were utterly astonished. "Raymond has defected? Raymond aiding Osborne against Hammond?" They exchanged incredulous glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But those terrifying bolts of lightning had indeed saved them. If not for the lightning attacks, Donna would have been dead, and Barlyn would have been severely injured. Thus, they believed Osborne's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn that Raymond! He dares to betray the great King of the Aberrants. He's courting death! And you all, you will die too!" Hammond spat out his threats before abruptly turning and fleeing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood they could not win if Raymond had truly defected and lurked in the shadows, ready to strike. If they didn't leave now, they might never get another chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quickly, Hammond and his men vanished, leaving everyone bewildered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Had they really retreated?" Just moments ago, despair had gripped them all. They believed they were going to die there. Yet now, with just a few words from Osborne, the enemy had retreated entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone helped each other up, their gazes filled with gratitude as they looked at Osborne. Even Donna felt immense gratitude towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what's going on? Did Raymond really defect?" Donna still found it hard to believe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment. Not wanting to reveal his own powers, he said, "He must have. Otherwise, why would he use his lightning powers to save you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna was a little dazed. She and Raymond had clashed three times, each trying to kill the other. Yet now, he had saved her? Something felt off, but the lightning attacks had been undeniably real, so she had to believe it for now. "Osborne, where is Raymond? I want to talk to him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head. After exiting the underground tunnel, he had left the unconscious Raymond with Zoe to get here quickly. Raymond had not defected, and Osborne couldn't let Donna meet him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know where he is. He probably doesn't want to show himself. Ms. Donna Radcliffe, let's not worry about that now. We should head back quickly," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna hesitated but eventually nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the group cleaned up the battlefield, gathered the bodies of the fallen, and helped the wounded. They left the slums and returned to the Radcliffe Manor. Only then did everyone finally relax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barlyn, I have some things to take care of. Contact me if you need anything," Osborne said to Barlyn before leaving the manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He returned to the slums and found the hidden Zoe. Seeing that she was safe, he breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe relaxed upon seeing Osborne return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go. I'll take you home." Soon, Osborne took Zoe and Raymond, who were unconscious, back to Isa's Institute of Human Research. Isa was already waiting for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is he? Where's the Class C+ metahuman? Do you know how desperately I need research subjects right now? I..." Isa was speaking when she suddenly noticed Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was stunned. She rubbed her eyes and circled Zoe twice, a look of astonishment on her face. "Who is this little girl? Why does she look exactly like your sister, Anastasia? Is she a clone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's words stunned Zoe. "Miss, what did you just say? You said I look exactly like Osborne's sister?" She glanced at Osborne after speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew he couldn't hide it any longer and nodded. "Zoe, you do look exactly like my sister, Anastasia! I even suspect you two might be twins!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
