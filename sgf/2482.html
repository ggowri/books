  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aaron felt a strong sense of threat from Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This threat did not come from the current Osborne but from the strength he displayed, far surpassing his cultivation level, making Aaron uneasy about a stronger Osborne in the future.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Aaron decided to completely eliminate Osborne, giving him no chance to grow further.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as Osborne's future is destroyed, the potential threat he poses will be eliminated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he struck with full force without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warrior going all out against someone who isn't even an Empyrean Sacredness sounds almost unbelievable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Aaron did exactly that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was confident he could quickly deal with Osborne, but what happened next left him utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Flash!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Facing Aaron's full-force attack, Osborne knew he couldn't possibly withstand it, so he summoned Flash without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the next moment, a piercing dragon's roar echoed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash instantly appeared in front of Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before this, Flash had been staying in Drum's Dimensional Microcosm, playing around when bored and feeding on the Ethereal Bloom scattered across the land and the Beast Soul Flower specially prepared by Osborne when hungry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For this reason, Flash always maintained its original form.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, when his three heads and six pairs of wings appeared, Aaron was instantly stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, his attack had already erupted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn</span><span>'</span><span>t think much and simply said coldly, "Whatever it is, I'll just blast it to death!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A powerful energy surged down as Flash immediately entered combat mode. His three glowing dragon heads furiously unleashed Dragon's Breath, colliding fiercely with Aaron's attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rumble!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dragon's Breath gradually collapsed and was forced back, unable to fully withstand Aaron's attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's face turned grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew that Flash couldn't match Aaron. After all, Aaron had reached Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, far more terrifying than the Magma Devourer back then.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Magma Devourer's advantage lay only in its strong defense, and Flash was able to fight it for so long precisely because of its lack of offensive power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Aaron is completely different. His offensive power far surpasses his defensive strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash won't last long at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly thought of a plan. He could summon Drum. Although she was still in her juvenile stage and couldn't directly join the fight, the pets she raised might come in handy&mdash;thousands of Empyrean Sacredness-level Silver Beetles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most of these Silver Beetles were at Primary Empyrean Sacredness, with only a few reaching Mid Empyrean Sacredness, but if they joined forces to attack Aaron, they would surely cause him considerable trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, defeating Aaron is still impossible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, these Silver Beetles would inevitably suffer heavy losses, with most of them being killed by Aaron.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, Osborne gave up on the idea.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">With my current abilities, unless I awaken Empress Kira from Drum of Empress Kira, there's no way to deal with Aaron. My goal isn't to kill Aaron but to escape!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne looked around.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The surroundings were filled with a sticky force, a cage-like barrier constructed by Aaron, completely sealing off the area, leaving Osborne unable to use spatial power or escape.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as he broke this cage-like barrier, he could escape.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With spatial power, Osborne believed he could shake off Aaron and save his life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Having made up his mind, Osborne immediately took action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Flash, buy me some time!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he put away the Bloodwrought Bow and took out the Warfare Scythe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This Warfare Scythe is incredibly sharp.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Facing the cage barrier cast by Aaron, Osborne couldn't break through with ordinary means and could only rely on the sharpness of the Warfare Scythe to forcibly tear it apart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He shouted, "Break for me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne swung the Warfare Scythe, slashing fiercely at the cage barrier, instantly creating a crack on it. However, the barrier was extremely sturdy, and such a crack was far from enough to completely destroy it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Keep going!" He didn't stop.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The situation was extremely critical. Flash couldn't withstand Aaron's offensive at all and could only rely on speed to maneuver, but its body kept taking damage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If the cage barrier couldn't be broken quickly, Flash would soon be killed by Aaron.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Osborne wouldn't escape death either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne roared, "Break it for me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He kept swinging the Warfare Scythe, striving to widen the cracks on the barrier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This scene left Aaron in the distance stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How is this possible? With his strength, he can actually damage my cage? Could it be because of the scythe in his hand?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aaron greedily stared at the Warfare Scythe in Osborne's hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Is a mere Mid-grade Sacred Artifact really this sharp?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is truly a treasure! But it will soon be mine! Let me deal with this three-headed monster first, then I'll take care of you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he finished speaking, Aaron unleashed even greater power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, Flash was sent flying, covered in wounds, blood splattering everywhere.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, these injuries did not make Flash feel fear or retreat; instead, they fueled his excitement and thrill.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His war-mad genes were completely awakened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash launched a frenzied attack, desperately entangling Aaron to buy Osborne time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, the gap in strength couldn't be bridged by sheer madness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Crack!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Aaron's fierce assault, Flash's wings were broken, bones shattered countless times, leaving him in a gruesome state. His strength was severely damaged, unable to block Aaron's attacks any longer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne witnessed all this, filled with anger and heartache.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash is, after all, just a newborn child.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Flash severely injured, Osborne grew anxious and immediately prepared to summon Drum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He still needed some time to completely break through the cage barrier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, only Drum's pet, the Empyrean Sacredness Silver Beetles, could temporarily protect Flash and delay Aaron's actions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, just as Osborne was about to act, he suddenly sensed something unusual.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, with a loud bang, the cage barrier imposed by Aaron instantly collapsed, as an incredibly terrifying force destroyed the barrier from the outside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned but quickly regained his composure, overjoyed. "Flash, let's go!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly put away Flash, preparing to use spatial power to escape. Without the cage barrier's obstruction, spatial power was no longer restricted. He was certain Aaron couldn't catch up to him anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, at this moment, something that terrified Osborne happened again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He discovered that even though the cage barrier was shattered, he still couldn't perform interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An invisible force enveloped his entire body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This force was terrifying!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's heart instantly sank. Because he knew, a more powerful presence must have appeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A presence far more powerful than Aaron.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Who is that person?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Facing such a formidable enemy, how can I escape?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Osborne was sinking into despair, a commanding voice echoed in his mind, "Osborne, don't rush to leave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are safe now! With me here, no one can harm you, and no one can take away what is yours!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked into the distance in disbelief, and when he recognized the figure, a look of surprise and joy appeared on his face. "Ms. Alba?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
