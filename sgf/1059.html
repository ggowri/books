  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wesson Augustine, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' forces have entered the territory of Newport City! They're closing in fast on the Augustine Estate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon receiving the news, Wesson shot up from his seat, his expression filled with seriousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It&rsquo;s time! Keep scouting!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get everyone ready! The battle is about to begin! Anyone below Class A needs to take refuge in Challenge Peak! It's heavily fortified and can protect you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Battle formations, get ready!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Wesson gave orders, a swarm of drones gathered overhead, monitoring every movement around the Augustine Estate, locking onto anyone who dared to approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't long before a throng of several hundred figures appeared at the entrance of </span><span>the Augustine Estate. They all dressed in uniform garments, their faces masked by blood-red fabric, leaving only their cold, lethal eyes exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air around them pulsed with a palpable, overwhelming power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, hardly anyone was classified as Class A; the weakest were Class AA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a vantage point, Wesson stood with the leaders of several major factions, their faces grim as they looked at the approaching </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are they masking their faces?" Greyson from the Lambert family couldn't hold back his curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not sure! Our intel suggests that there are 3,000 of these masks in total. Most of them are Class AAA, with a few </span><span>Class</span><span> AA thrown in. They don't talk&mdash;they just kill! This is just a small part of them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he spoke, another wave of masked figures arrived, joining those already at the entrance of the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't launch an attack&mdash;just stood there, fixated on the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their numbers continued to add up from 1,000 to 3,000.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, all those 3,000 masked figures were gathered at the entrance, their eerie silence weighing heavily on the atmosphere, as if they didn&rsquo;t know how to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tension was palpable, and those inside the Augustine Estate could hardly breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne were present, he would recognize that all 3,000 of these individuals were Gerardo's Human Slaves!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They masked because they couldn&rsquo;t expose their true identities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These Human Slaves were a force to be reckoned with!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like Osborne, they had been thrust into Human Slave incubators, absorbing energy from the cultivation fluid to enhance their physical strength. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, their bodies and minds had been enslaved, now solely loyal to Gerardo, only responsive to his commands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As 3,000 Human Slaves stood gathered, their immense presence was terrifying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this was just a fraction of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon enough, more forces arrived, this time a squad of identical figures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were clones, including Medusas, Werewolves, Vampires, </span><span>Taurens</span><span>, Titans, and so on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ranks of clones seemed endless as they converged at the entrance of the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them hailed Class A and higher, maintaining the same eerie silence as they coldly looked at the Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their numbers were skyrocketing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, their numbers swelled to 40,000 strong and stopped increasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, the faces of those inside the Augustine Estate darkened, anxiety settling in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just the sheer number and strength of these clones were enough to rival their four battle formations! They were only lacking in Class S warriors. But the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> had plenty of those!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they braced themselves for the storm ahead, the weight of the encroaching threat loomed larger than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a matter of moments, Class S clones began to emerge, one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The numbers of Class S clones were skyrocketing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like watching a snowball roll down a hill&mdash;growing bigger and faster with each moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the count of Class S clones skyrocketed to 500&mdash;but it didn&rsquo;t stop, as more began to materialize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the tally of Class S clones reached 800, and then, at last, it came to a halt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson, Greyson, and the others couldn't suppress their gasps as they stared at the daunting assembly of 800 Class S clones. Fear and despair flickered in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>800 of them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They only had 50 Class S fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could they possibly stand a chance?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, even Wesson felt desperate. Gripping Godfather's scepter tightly, he could feel his hand quiver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "The former Godfather is severely injured and still in a coma!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The new Godfather is still breaking through. Who knows when he'll be back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's strength isn't enough to unleash the potential of the scepter! That's why she handed it over to me, to take charge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even with Godfather's scepter, how on earth can we fend off 800 Class S clones?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's like fate has turned against the Augustine family, against the Draco Group!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson clenched his jaw, feeling his resolve starting to crumble when he gazed out at the ever-growing might of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> didn't seem in a hurry to attack. They remained stationary, poised outside the gates of the Augustine Estate. Looked like they were waiting for someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And who they were waiting for was none other than Gerardo.</span></p><div class="pagination">
