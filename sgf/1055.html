  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Gerardo's command, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> stepped up pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Across </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, numerous Ancient Families and superpowers fell before them, faced with a stark choice&mdash;submit to Gerardo or face annihilation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic gripped the entire region.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> was back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> had become an even more terrifying, stronger force than they were decades ago. Dozens of Class S clones launched their attacks in waves, supported by thousands of Class A clones and Human Slaves. No power stood a chance against them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, a typical superpower might boast one or two Class S warriors, and having a double-digit Class AAA champion was already impressive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the face of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, their strength was laughably inadequate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those superpowers unwilling to submit had no choice but to flee, abandoning their homes before the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their only escape route led to Newport City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the hidden superpowers weren't spared; those who refused to bow to Gerardo and wanted to avoid destruction had to seek refuge with the Augustine family, hoping for their protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew that the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' ultimate targets were the Augustine family and the Draco Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the entire expanse of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, only the Augustine family and the Draco Group had a fighting chance against the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, countless Ancient Families and superpowers fled to Newport City, seeking shelter under the Augustine family, hoping to band together with the Draco Group to resist the encroaching threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Newport City became crowded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family found itself at the center of a swirling storm of refugees and warriors alike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> pressed forward, its momentum relentless. In just four days, they would occupy all fifty provinces of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, ultimately surrounding Newport City, for a decisive showdown against the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This battle would determine the future landscape of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the Augustine Estate buzzed with a palpable sense of urgency and tension. Everyone wore a grave expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "Can we really withstand the might of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere was thick with pessimism, and many were unaware that the League of Divine Descent and the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization had dispatched a significant number </span><span>of Class S experts, ready to join forces with the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> against them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they had known, their despair would have deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, on a lonely island nearly two thousand miles from Newport City, Osborne finally woke up from his slumber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where am I? What happened? Wasn't I tossed into Gerardo's Human Slave incubator? How did I end up here?" He confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood up when suddenly he sensed something was off about his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stunned, he exclaimed, "My body... It feels so powerful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of excitement washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remembered being thrown into the Human Slave incubator, where the crimson liquid had felt like molten lava coursing through him, burning his cells and pushing him to the brink of agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, that very liquid had also been busy transforming his body at an astonishing rate, the pain intensifying with each passing moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne had struggled to endure it, but just when he thought he might lose consciousness, the power of Blood Cross surged within him, protecting his mind and soul from collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, that protective force had also severed Osborne's connection to the outside world, plunging him into a deep, dreamless sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, after he woke up, he was on this island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He marveled at his new strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did I absorb all the energy from that Human Slave incubator?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was utterly astonished by the transformation. It felt as though he had been completely reborn; his physical capabilities had skyrocketed, at least tenfold&mdash;perhaps even more!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This enhancement wasn't just limited to one aspect; it was a holistic elevation, including strength, speed, agility, defense, flexibility...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every facet of his being felt way more powerful, as if he had stepped into the shoes of a different person entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne found his strength was easily twenty times greater than it used to be!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the most striking change was in his defensive capabilities. At a glance, his skin appeared unchanged, but in reality, it was now incredibly resilient. To Osborne, it felt like the skin of a Class S Tauren King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Actually, it felt even stronger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His skin had the defense that rivaled his martial art aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it wasn't just his skin that had transformed; his flesh and bones had undergone a dramatic progress as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Felt like an ordinary Class S warrior could struggle to break through my defenses of skin now! This is unreal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was utterly shocked, continuously soaking in the extent of his physical transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overall, Osborne felt that his body's strength had amplified roughly twenty times compared to before, and to his astonishment, his instincts were not far off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, his physical strength was rated at a measly 9; now, it soared beyond 200, </span><span>clocking in at a staggering 220!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was over 24 times what he had once possessed!</span></p><div class="pagination">
