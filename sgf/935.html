  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne blocked all the attacks, he turned his icy gaze toward the twenty enemies before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had overheard their conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The unwavering loyalty of those eight warriors to Sebastian and to the Draco Group struck a chord in his heart. Now that he was the boss of the Draco Group, they were his subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a stroke of luck Osborne arrived just in time; otherwise, he would have lost eight steadfast subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even as he saved them, Osborne couldn't shake off the grim reality that many more had likely perished at the hands of the Aberrants. The thought darkened his eyes, igniting a cold, lethal fury within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne fixed his gaze on Duke Medusa, his voice as frigid as the winter winds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke Medusa's expression hardened immediately, panic washing over her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're... Osborne?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, aren't you supposed to be trapped in the Augustine Estate? How did you end up here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Duke Medusa's bravado evaporated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they had a numerical advantage of twenty to one, the military resolve vanished into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They turned and bolted for their lives, fully aware of Osborne's prowess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had achieved a perfect clear during his Honor Quest Ceremony, defeating all challengers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now ranked number one on the Godson Rankings, he had risen far above them&mdash;the former number one, Isa, had even vanished from the board.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no denying it; Osborne's strength had reached the very limits of Class AAA. Even a typical Class S fighter would find it impossible to take him on&mdash;much less a bunch of Class AAA clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run! Send word back about Osborne leaving the Augustine Estate and heading towards Skyefall! We need stronger reinforcements!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic surged through Duke Medusa as she barked orders, and the group scattered, desperately trying to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile appeared on Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just recently, ten Class AAA clones from the Aberrants had ambushed him, pushing him to the brink of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But here was a trophy of irony. These twenty Class AAA clones from the Aberrants lacked even the courage to face him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scoffed, his voice dripping with disdain. "Not so fast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you've come all this way, you're all going to stay and become blood energy in the Blood Cross!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that chilling declaration, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vast expanse of his Light Realm erupted instantaneously, engulfing every last one of the Aberrants in its glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear painted their faces as they attacked frantically, trying to shatter Osborne's Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they stood no chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even prodigies like Marlon, Scarlett, and Bradley had struggled to break through it; the only way to do so involved self-detonation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And here were a mere bunch of clones hoping to disrupt his Solar Realm?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were dreaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's wrap this up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waved his hand, unleashing a torrent of Destruction Orbs. Tiny light spots appeared from thin air, cascading down like rain, trapping the twenty clones in a deadly embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No sanctuary awaited them; their only choice was to fight back against the menacing orbs, a futile endeavor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the glimmering spots rained down, piercing through their defenses and bodies, anguished cries erupted into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aaaah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chorus of agony echoed as Duke Medusas, Duke Titans, and Duke Taurens found themselves overwhelmed, their forms consumed by the relentless assault of Destruction Orbs. Even Duke Taurens' robust hide was powerless against such mighty force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chilling screams soon fell silent, however.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, all twenty Class AAA clones lay lifeless, their bodies utterly mangled, nearly erased by the Destruction Orbs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A vast wave of blood energy lingered in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't need to transform into the Vampire this time; he simply tapped into the might of the Blood Cross, effortlessly devouring all that blood energy in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the power surged within the Blood Cross once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling pleased, he thought to himself that if he could take down a few more clones from the Aberrants, he would amass enough blood energy to help the Blood Demon members increase their strength even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne retracted the Light Realm and turned to face the eight others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stood there, wide-eyed, stunned by what they had just witnessed. They thought, "Did he really take out twenty Class AAA clones so easily? His strength seems almost unreal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, they had no idea that Osborne was actually the boss of the Draco Group, the new Godfather, but that barely registered in their minds. All they felt was admiration and gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual smile, Osborne asked, "You guys all right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The eight quickly shook their heads, responding, "We're not dead yet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they weren't at death's door, they were wounded and needed medical attention soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Serena and her group finally arrived on the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their expressions mirrored the shock the others felt. Osborne had moved so fast that they hadn't even had the chance to jump in; all twenty enemies had been dealt with before they could lift a finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne's Draco Star Wristlet vibrated again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked down, and his expression shifted from relief to alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The device was receiving another distress signal, accompanied by a location tracking signal.</span></p><div class="pagination">
