  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela held onto Adriana's promise like a lifeline&mdash;if Osborne managed to shine in the state duel and snag a spot in the zone duel, Adriana would carve out time to watch him compete in person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Angela couldn't shake the feeling that the cards were stacked against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top ten contenders were racking up points like crazy. Jared, currently sitting at tenth place, was leading the strongest disciples from the Eight Great Academies on a ruthless plundering spree. Even with a hefty three million points under his belt, he was barely clinging to his spot, constantly looking over his shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne trying to close that gap?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Close to impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was currently scraping by with a measly 300 thousand points. Unless he could somehow consecutively take down ten teams on par with Jared, he wouldn't even get a whiff of the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that was if Osborne didn't lose to anyone else along the way, because then his hard-earned points would be snatched right back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how could he pull that off?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a powerhouse team backing him up, Osborne had zero chance of toppling someone like Jared! In the entire state duel, there were only four competitors who could solo Jared's team&mdash;Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one else even came close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with a solid team, a win against Jared's crew was never a sure thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So yeah, Angela figured Osborne's chances of cracking the top ten were slim to none.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A spot in the top fifty would be a respectable showing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But those two from Tempest Fortress City, Clara and Leroy, are a real surprise package! They actually teamed up and took down some serious contenders! They've both clawed their way into the top thirty!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still, they're sitting ducks for plundering, so hanging onto those top thirty spots will be an uphill battle! Clara used to be teammates with Osborne, so now that he's back, they'll probably join forces again... A trio like that could comfortably secure a place in the top fifty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela was doing some quick mental math.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how she sliced it, the best she could realistically hope for Osborne was a solid top-fifty finish, maybe a shot at breaking into the top thirty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top twenty? Forget about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top ten? That was pie-in-the-sky thinking, pure fantasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anything beyond that? She didn't even dare to let her mind wander there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were glued to the projection screen. Osborne had just stepped through the Translocator to the second layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm and was activating the Translocator to head back to the first layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he touched down back on the first layer, the final day of the state duel dawned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, everyone had returned to the Arctic Maw Chasm's first layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The final, frenzied plundering was about to kick off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood on the first layer's Translocator, breathing a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He muttered, "Finally made it back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Almost missed the cut-off and gotten the boot! Now I can finally catch my breath. Last day of the state duel&mdash;it's a free-for-all on the first layer! But I don't need to get involved in any of that plundering nonsense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne glanced at the leaderboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha was sitting pretty at the top with over eight million points. Horace was hot on her heels in second place with over seven million, followed by Broderick and Benson with over six million apiece.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Not bad, not bad at all! Agatha's been busy racking up those points! Looks like she shook off whatever was holding her back not long after I left, then hightailed it out of the seventh layer to start swiping points from everyone else. Eight million points, huh? Could she actually be a threat?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne checked his token stash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back on the first day of the state duel, Osborne had been knee-deep in hunting for tokens on the sixth layer. He'd hauled in over a hundred, but never bothered to do an exact count.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, after taking inventory, Osborne discovered he was sitting on a mind-boggling 165 tokens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a staggering 16.5 million points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he registered them all under his name, Osborne would instantly rocket to the top of the leaderboard, leaving Agatha in the dust!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd be sitting on double her score! Given the circumstances, this championship was practically in the bag for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, according to the rule book, even if someone managed to take him down, they could only plunder one-tenth of his points, and each person could only plunder him once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson took him down, he'd still walk away with the championship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could that actually happen?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hell no!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't about to let Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson beat him in a conga line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, Osborne had a trick up his sleeve&mdash;he could just hold off on registering those tokens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could bide his time until the state duel was almost over, then whip out the tokens, register them all at once, and skyrocket to the top of the leaderboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, it would be too late for anyone to try and plunder his points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That way, Osborne could lock in that first-place finish, with no sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne wasn't about to go that route.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he won like that, a bunch of people would cry foul, maybe even accuse him of cheating. They might even strip him of his victory and bar him from the zone duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That wouldn't be worth it in the slightest!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Right now, I can use the Sublime Concealment Orb to mask the energy signature of the tokens! Keep anyone from sniffing out that I'm carrying around a mountain of points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But I can't keep that up forever; someone's bound to call me out on it! So, once I find Clara, I need to register these tokens, pronto!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne decided to track down Clara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Clara was his teammate, Osborne had promised to help her break into the top ten and take her to the zone duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no intention of going back on that promise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">To get Clara into the top ten, I need to gift her at least four million points! To play it safe, I should probably bump that up to five million!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That would still leave me with over ten million points, more than enough to comfortably coast to first place!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that plan locked in, Osborne tried to get in touch with Clara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He called her communication terminal, but it just rang and rang without an answer, causing him to frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">There's only one explanation! Clara must be in the thick of a fight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking along those lines, Osborne started moving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm was vast, but with Satan's Eye in his arsenal, finding someone wasn't too difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, he spotted Clara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as Osborne got a good look at the situation, his face clouded over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara was in a fight, just as he'd suspected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she wasn't alone. Leroy was fighting shoulder-to-shoulder with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Clara and Leroy, teamed up? When did that happen?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But their opponents were even more surprising. It was Leroy's former teammates, the squad of elite disciples from the Eight Great Academies!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remembered that their captain was named Jared, ranked 28th on the strength leaderboard. While his individual combat prowess wasn't exactly top-tier, his squad was a force to be reckoned with, and Jared himself was holding down the tenth spot on the point leaderboard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Jared's squad is ganging up on Clara and Leroy? What in the world is going on here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne decided to hold his horses and hung back in the shadows, carefully observing the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He noticed that both Clara and Leroy had grown significantly stronger since the city duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared and his seven teammates were struggling to break through their defenses, which clearly infuriated Jared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spat out the words in a chilling voice. "Leroy, you still want to resist? You're a disciple of the Azure Haven Academy! I strongly advise you to throw in the towel now! Hand over your points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You both have around 800 thousand points. If you surrender, you'll give me an extra 1.6 million points, all but guaranteeing my place in the top ten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That way, the Eight Great Academies will secure a spot in the top ten! But if your stubborn resistance causes the Eight Great Academies to miss out on that top ten spot, you'll be branded a traitor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I'm ordering you right now&mdash;surrender immediately!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
