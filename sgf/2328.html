  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The golden aura enveloping Lincoln went off like a bomb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His huge body was sent flying backward, and as he crashed down, blood gushed out of him like a fountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lincoln slammed into the ice, creating a massive crater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he knew it, the ice caved in on him, burying him under its weight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deathly silence fell over the onlookers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those watching from afar were left with their jaws on the floor. They stared at Osborne, who stood there with his Bloodwrought Bow drawn, too shocked to even gulp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Lincoln from the Battle-ascendant Warriors Clan has been beaten so easily?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lincoln was ranked eighth on the power leaderboard, but a lot of folks thought that was a low-ball estimate. In fact, he was probably more like sixth or even fifth. Only Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson could regularly get the better of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was reflected on the score point leaderboard; Lincoln used to bounce between sixth, seventh, and eighth without any teammates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then Osborne, Clara, and Leroy came on the scene and pushed him down to eleventh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When it came to one-on-one fighting, Lincoln was a real force to be reckoned with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His special ability to get stronger as the fight went on made him a nightmare opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If one couldn't take him out fast, the only choices were to hightail it or get one's butt kicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Osborne had whipped Lincoln in a head-to-head showdown! And he did it so effortlessly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a cold shiver of fear ran through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd come here with the idea of robbing Osborne, Leroy, and Clara of their points, thinking that the trio's low rankings in strength made them easy pickings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, doubts started to creep in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Can we really take on Osborne and his mates? Or will we end up being the ones getting fleeced?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Even Lincoln couldn't hold a candle to Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many exchanged nervous glances and started having second thoughts. They were ready to ditch their plan to go after Osborne and his friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, a thunderous explosion ripped through the air as the ice shattered into a million pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of the wreckage emerged a colossal figure, blood-splattered. His clothes were in tatters, revealing his rippling golden muscles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Lincoln!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't down for the count after all. In fact, his energy vibes were even stronger than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes locked onto Osborne, alight with excitement and a fierce fighting fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was caught off-guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He actually made it out? This isn't normal..." he mumbled under his breath, narrowing his eyes as he activated Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Osborne saw hit him like a ton of bricks&mdash;Golden blood coursed through Lincoln's veins like a wild, raging river, rapidly supercharging his power and jacking up his energy signature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face turned grim.</span><br><span>What the hell's going on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Normally, a guy from the Battle-ascendant Warriors Clan doesn't bulk up this fast or this hard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly put two and two together.</span><br><span>Lincoln isn't just an ordinary member of the Battle-ascendant Warriors Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">His bloodline power might not be on par with the Invincible Battle Overlord, but he's definitely one of the top dogs in the clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mind was racing with realizations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Typically, Bloodline Powers took a nosedive over time. The longer the family tree, the more watered-down the power became. Even the most badass abilities could turn into something run-of-the-mill as the years rolled by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there were always outliers&mdash;reversion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bloodline heir could suddenly go through a radical transformation, reverting their lineage back to its prime or even blowing past it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Osborne, it was as clear as day that Lincoln was one of those rare birds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Battle Warrior's Rampage State, once a force to be reckoned with, had lost its edge for most over time. But Lincoln's version was way more potent than Osborne had bargained for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This could only point to one thing&mdash;Lincoln had probably undergone a reversion, beefing up his Battle Warrior's Rampage State beyond that of other Battle-ascendant Warriors Clan members and bringing him closer to the might of the Invincible Battle Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lincoln shouted, his eyes now blazing a brilliant gold, "Impressive! Osborne, you're a real heavyweight! I never thought I'd find someone this strong in a state duel besides Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But don't think you can take me down so easily! That power you just unleashed? It ain't cutting it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart skipped a beat at the sight. This just confirmed his hunch; Lincoln's bloodline had definitely reverted. The average Joe in the Battle-ascendant Warriors Clan didn't have golden eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Word on the street was that when the Invincible Battle Overlord activated his Battle Warrior's Rampage State, every single part of him glowed gold&mdash;skin, hair, blood, muscles, eyes, bones, even marrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While regular folks only showed golden skin, hair, and blood, Osborne's Satan's Eye revealed that Lincoln had golden eyes, muscles, and bones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His marrow was the only thing that didn't change, but even that was enough to send shivers down one's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why Lincoln, in his Battle Warrior's Rampage State, was a cut above the rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lincoln's got endless potential! If he can pull off another reversion, even his marrow might turn gold. Once that happens, he could be the second coming of the Invincible Battle Overlord. As long as he doesn't bite the dust early, he'll be one of the heavy-hitters on Racial Convergence Planet for sure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Still, pulling off another reversion won't be a walk in the park!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly snapped back to reality. "You're something else, Lincoln! But with just your current Battle Warrior's Rampage State, you're no match for me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I'm gonna put an end to this once and for all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne nocked another Sacred Power arrow. This time, he infused it with his Divine Ascendance Technique, the Spatial Oblivion Slash, cranking up its power even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sacred Power arrow zipped through the air and reached Lincoln in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Lincoln had bulked up, he still couldn't take the combined force of Osborne's Divine Ascendance Technique and Sacred Power arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, Lincoln was sent flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he couldn't get back on his feet. Golden energy burst out of him as the Battle Warrior's Rampage State was shattered by Osborne's arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without that state, even if he managed to stand up, he'd be a sitting duck against Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers were gobsmacked, their eyes as wide as saucers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned to face them, a cold smile spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you guys wanna raid our points too? If so, who's next? Step up! Beat me, and you can take the points from me and my mates!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne hoisted his Bloodwrought Bow and leveled it at the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's got the guts?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his words echoed in the air, the onlookers exchanged nervous glances. They could feel the raw power emanating from Osborne's Sacred Power arrow, and it completely sapped their fighting spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, those within Osborne's line of sight scattered like scared rabbits. They hightailed it out of there as far and as fast as their legs could carry them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Osborne's Sacred Power arrow at the ready, constantly on the verge of being unleashed, the spectators disappeared in an instant.</span></p><div class="pagination">
