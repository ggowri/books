  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Rose Rebels? Valentino?" Osborne remembered the name.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, Leroy and Clara had also mentioned Valentino to him, but he hadn't paid much attention at the time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It is said that Valentino won the state duel with an overwhelming advantage. His dominance was so strong that even the opponents ranked second to fifth teamed up to try to take his points but were defeated by him instead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's like Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson teaming up against Osborne, only to be defeated by Osborne in the end.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Valentino's state, he is undoubtedly the undisputed king, far surpassing everyone else in strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite Valentino's strength, Osborne didn't care.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, if Valentino obtained the Starry Eye, it would be a different story. After all, luck plays a big role in the Treasure Hunt, and with Valentino's strong abilities combined with the boost from the Starry Eye, he would undoubtedly pose a significant threat to Osborne in the zone duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I must be cautious of this opponent!" Osborne silently reminded himself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The champion of the zone duel will receive 100 million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> as a reward. These </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> can be used to exchange treasures in the Glorious Divine Kingdom's treasury or trade with major forces. Even at the minimum standard, 100 million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> can be exchanged for a Sacred Crystal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, winning the zone </span><span>duel</span><span> championship is equivalent to gaining 100 million Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This championship is something Osborne will never give up easily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The auctioneer continued, "Item number 265. I believe many of you here are quite familiar with this item&mdash;it is the dragon horn of the Sacred Dragon Clan!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The dragon horn left behind by a Sacred Dragon Clan warrior at the Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection realm, containing the power of thunder!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The auction continued, showcasing increasingly unique and precious items, from the dragon horn of the Sacred Dragon Clan to the claws of the Sacred Tiger Clan, and even the wings of the Angel Clan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Various powerful items appeared one after another.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some items' power even rivaled that of a Sacred Artifact, leaving Osborne stunned and giving him a clearer understanding of the Phantom Commerce Guild's capability and strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Obtaining these treasures is no easy task. The Phantom Commerce Guild must have deep ties with some powerful force in the depths of the universe," Osborne said with a serious expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His parents were betrayed by the Phantom Commerce Guild in this life, so Osborne was filled with disgust and hatred toward this organization.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, as one of the three top forces on the Racial Convergence Planet, the Phantom Commerce Guild was far beyond Osborne's current strength, leaving him no choice but to endure for now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The auctioneer continued, "The 320th item..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The auction finally reached its climax as the final headline item took the stage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a peculiar item.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The auctioneer began the introduction, "This is the final item of the auction, the grand finale. Its name is Sacred Altar. Its function is very simple&mdash;just offer Sacred Crystals to the Sacred Altar, and it will return Sacred Power, continuously enhancing your strength."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Whoever possesses the Sacred Altar, as long as they have enough Sacred Crystals, will never run out of Sacred Power and can continuously gain infinite strength."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, it is an extremely powerful Defensive Sacred Artifact, with defensive capabilities rivaling any top-tier Defensive Sacred Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Starting bid, ten million Sacred Crystals!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let the bidding begin!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the auctioneer's words fell, a new round of intense bidding began, with the big figures in the VIP boxes frantically placing their bids.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne showed no interest in this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Sacred Altar? Just invest Sacred Crystals to gain Sacred Power? This is meaningless."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, he possessed the Chaotic Spiritual Root, allowing him to continuously restore Sacred Power without relying on Sacred Crystals, with results even better than the Sacred Altar.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for the Sacred Altar's claimed defensive capability comparable to a top-grade Defensive Sacred Artifact, Osborne remained indifferent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His Warfare Shield, though only mid-grade, had been nourished by the Warfare Ancient Tree to nearly top-tier level, with defensive capabilities no less than a top-grade Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The only thing Osborne found somewhat useful about the Sacred Altar was its ability to enhance Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But considering its high price, Osborne had long dismissed the idea.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Twenty-five million Sacred Crystals!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Twenty-six million Sacred Crystals!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the price of the Sacred Altar skyrocketed to over thirty million Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This Sacred Altar is not only precious but also significantly effective for Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, the person in Box One successfully won the Sacred Altar at a high price of over forty million Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The person in Box One is from </span><span>Skyearth</span><span> Dominion!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>Skyearth</span><span> Dominion is one of the most powerful First-rate Powers in the Glorious Divine Kingdom, on par with Fairy Moon Sect, Golden Dragon Society, and Purple Thunder Gang, all with the potential to become the fourth top force on the Racial Convergence Planet."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, Brenda from </span><span>Skyearth</span><span> Dominion is a strong contender for the zone </span><span>duel</span><span> championship. Her performance in the state duel might not be as stunning as Valentino's, but it's said her strength far surpasses Valentino's."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I wonder if </span><span>Skyearth</span><span> Dominion will give this Sacred Altar to Brenda. If Brenda possesses the Sacred Altar, her Sacred Power will become endless&mdash;who could possibly rival her in the zone duel?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd's discussion made Osborne remember another name, Brenda from </span><span>Skyearth</span><span> Dominion, the hot favorite to win the championship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne is also a highly anticipated contestant, but he's not a favorite to win the championship&mdash;rather, he's one of the top contenders for a spot in the top ten.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, he is the state </span><span>duel</span><span> champion of Zephyr State, which has already proven his strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even in the higher-level zone duel, no one dares to underestimate him anymore. The days of being completely overlooked are long gone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, few people still believe Osborne can win the championship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, his background is too ordinary.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the thousand participants in the state duel, more than half are from various First-rate Powers, while those from Second-rate Powers are only a minority.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Mystic Sirius Sect behind Osborne is ranked among the lower tiers even within the Second-rate Powers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It can offer Osborne very little help.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In contrast, Valentino of the Rose Rebels received full support from his sect, spending 20 million Sacred Crystals to purchase the Void Ray's Starry Eye for him, giving him an absolute advantage in the zone duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Sacred Altar acquired by </span><span>Skyearth</span><span> Dominion will most likely be prioritized for Brenda's use.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The treasures purchased by various First-rate Powers, such as the dragon horn of the Sacred Dragon Clan, the claws of the Sacred Tiger Clan, and the wings of the Angel Clan, will likely be given to their elite disciples in the end.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The disciples of these First-rate Powers lack neither powerful Sacred Artifacts nor rare treasures.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, almost no one believes that Osborne from the Second-rate Power Mystic Sirius Sect can win the championship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After leaving the auction, Osborne discovered that the Phantom Commerce Guild also had a casino, which was currently open for betting on the zone </span><span>duel</span><span> results.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I only have a little over a hundred thousand Sacred Crystals left, barely enough for cultivation! And the Ascending Sacred Sanctum requires a huge </span><span>amount</span><span> of Sacred Crystals to unleash its true power. I must find a way to earn some Sacred Crystals! Betting at the casino is undoubtedly the best option!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Phantom Commerce Guild is wealthy; I need to win some Sacred Crystals back from their casino."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After pondering for a moment, Osborne walked straight into the Phantom Commerce Guild's casino.</span></p><div class="pagination">
