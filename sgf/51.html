  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the third stage, a brawl assessment was conducted with 100 individuals divided into ten groups, engaging in a no-holds-barred melee where being knocked down meant elimination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The ranking was based on the time of being knocked down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The last person standing in each group would advance to the final showdown, determining the ultimate rankings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Collaboration was allowed during the melee.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s group consisted of eleven members, with the other ten from different security firms who wouldn&rsquo;t normally team up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, due to Osborne&rsquo;s outstanding performance in the previous stages, they decided to unite, aiming to eliminate Osborne at the earliest opportunity and ensure his bottom ranking in the third stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">One of them, ranked sixth in the previous stages, asked with a gloomy expression as they surrounded Osborne, &ldquo;Which security firm are you from?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If Osborne hadn&rsquo;t unexpectedly joined the assessment, he could have easily made it into the top five and had a significant chance to become Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard, enjoying a multimillion-dollar salary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Therefore, he harbored an unusually strong dislike towards Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not from a security firm,&rdquo; Osborne replied nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The man paused, then snapped, &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re not a pro, yet you&rsquo;re here trying to snatch our jobs? Well, then don&rsquo;t blame us for teaming up against you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He then challenged, &ldquo;E-level martial artist, Mark Moore, care to spar?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The other nine followed suit, introducing themselves as martial artists of Class F.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Class F martial artists?&rdquo; Osborne was surprised, as they were all martial artists, albeit mostly at the lowest Class F level, except for Mark at E-level.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne, feeling eager, added, &ldquo;Are you all martial artists? I&rsquo;m not sure of my level, but I think even if you team up, you won&rsquo;t stand a chance against me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Arrogant!&rdquo; Mark and the others exploded in anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As the assessment official gave the signal, the brawl began, with all ten rushing towards Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going down!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;In this stage, you&rsquo;ll only rank at the bottom!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Charge!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">On the high platform, Ophelia and Wesley watched intently as the third stage commenced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;This time, this loser is in for a tough ride. I heard these top bodyguards from the ten leading security firms are all martial artists with formidable combat skills.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Any one of them could easily school Osborne. Now that they&rsquo;re teaming up, Osborne will definitely be the first to go, ending up at the bottom in the third stage,&rdquo; Wesley remarked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia nodded, wanting to express the same sentiment. Based on her knowledge of Osborne, he couldn&rsquo;t possibly match these elite bodyguards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But recalling how Osborne unexpectedly surged ahead in the first stage, she swallowed her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope so, or he&rsquo;ll truly become Ms. Radcliffe&rsquo;s bodyguard.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that thought, Ophelia&rsquo;s expression turned grim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">On the other side, Donna and Clarissa observed the third stage assessment. Clarissa appeared aloof and indifferent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, inwardly, she was worried. When she saw those guys team up against Osborne, she tightly clenched her fists.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She struggled to maintain composure and asked, &ldquo;Captain Paul, do you think Mr. Augustine can still shine in the third stage?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul chuckled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be tough. His ten opponents, at the weakest, are Class F martial artists. The strongest, Mark, hails from the second-ranked Mornic Security Company and possesses the skills of a Class E martial artist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;United as they are, unless Osborne has the strength close to a Class D martial artist, he won&rsquo;t stand a chance. It&rsquo;s likely he&rsquo;ll be defeated in an instant.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Paul spoke, Clarissa grew even more concerned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, Mark and his ten men finally engaged Osborne. Confidence and arrogance adorned their faces as they moved swiftly like beasts, launching fierce attacks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Martial artists, also known as super black belts, exceeded the pinnacle of ordinary achievements in major martial arts systems.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Achieving a black belt was considered the highest rank for most people, but surpassing it led to becoming a Class F martial artist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">To the layman, Class F martial artists were already terrifying, with strong physical abilities that could seriously injure someone with a single punch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">All ten assailants surrounding Osborne were martial artists.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mark himself was a Class E martial artist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Their combined might was terrifying, their attacks relentless, enveloping Osborne like a tightly woven net, sealing off all avenues of escape.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Osborne remained completely unruffled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mark and his cohorts were undoubtedly formidable, but compared to Milo, who had attacked him just two days prior, they paled in comparison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Milo was a Class C metahuman, and his strength was on par with that of a Class C martial artist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If Osborne could hold his own against Milo, why should he fear these opponents?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With composure, he activated Satan&rsquo;s Eye.</p><div class="pagination">
