  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We, the Lord League, are willing to submit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Eliot uttered those words, Eddie froze, disbelief washing over his features. He looked at Eliot with disappointment, then turned away, leading the group of Prophet Alliance warriors to distance themselves from him, as if to draw a line in the sand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they glanced back at Eliot, their eyes were filled with icy contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the remaining members of Lord League let out a collective sigh of relief upon hearing their leader's declaration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't want to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trapped in a dire situation with only about sixty of them left, surrounded by thousands of warriors from the Dark Deity Legion, Pantheon League, and </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, submission seemed to be their only path to survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Eliot spoke those fateful words, a newfound determination flickered in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the sake of survival and dignity, submitting didn't feel like a disgrace&mdash;not in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Nelson, the leader of the Pantheon League, burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eliot, you've made a wise choice!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The great Lord Malevolence is destined to rule </span><span>Celestara</span><span>! Sure, there are still pockets </span><span>of human resistance, but they're nothing to worry about. They'll be crushed by the Dark Deity Legion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if they somehow survive that, once Lord Malevolence returns, they'll be wiped out without a doubt. No one will escape!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're only leading humanity toward destruction!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But we, we're the smart ones. By submitting to Lord Malevolence first, we're not just saving the remnants of humanity&mdash;we're ensuring our strength grows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The vast cosmos holds countless worlds, many far more powerful than </span><span>Celestara</span><span>. As human deities, we lack the strength to venture beyond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Lord Malevolence can! By aiding him now, we'll be led into a glorious future among the stars!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only then can humanity carve its name into the annals of this universe!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, choosing to submit is undoubtedly the best decision! Those stubborn rebels resisting Lord Malevolence are the true traitors, leading humanity to its doom!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Nelson finished, Eliot felt a wave of relief wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded. "I see it the same way. From now on, we'll be comrades, serving Lord Malevolence with unwavering loyalty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emperor Dare from </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization chimed in with a grin, "Welcome aboard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time will prove we're the ones truly looking out for humanity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie could no longer contain himself. His voice rose in anger. "Shameless! You betray humanity, your own race, your beliefs, and then spin this grandiose tale to justify it? You're despicable, and believe me, you'll pay for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his outburst, Eliot, Nelson, and Emperor Dare all exchanged glances, their expressions shifting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nelson sneered, addressing Apocalypse Harbinger, "Hmph, even when faced with death, they remain stubborn!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apocalypse Harbinger, these Prophet Alliance fools will never submit. Why not let us from Pantheon League handle them? I'll take care of every last one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't let such pests interfere with Lord Malevolence's grand plans!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apocalypse Harbinger merely smiled, a glint of amusement in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need for you to dirty your hands. I never intended for the Prophet Alliance to survive; I just need Lord League to take care of them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned his gaze back to Eliot. "Since Lord League has chosen to submit, I trust you won't mind helping me eliminate this pesky Prophet Alliance, will you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the words, Eliot felt a pang of guilt gnaw at his conscience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Lord League had enjoyed a cordial relationship with the Prophet Alliance in the past, and he and Eddie had been friends since the Age of Gods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he was being asked to carry out an act of betrayal against his friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the cold glare from Apocalypse Harbinger left no room for hesitation. Eliot knew he had to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was his initiation, his testament of loyalty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gathering his resolve, Eliot looked at Eddie and said, "Eddie, why be so stubborn? You must realize that in the face of Lord Malevolence's overwhelming power, we human gods stand no chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Continued resistance will only lead humanity to annihilation. Why not submit to Lord Malevolence? By becoming his vassal, humanity can not only survive but also grow stronger under his guidance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Eddie, won't you reconsider and submit too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie's face contorted with fury, and he spat at Eliot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My foot! Eliot, I rue the day I ever knew you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To think I once considered you a friend is revolting!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Betray humanity and submit to Lord Malevolence? Not a chance! If you must, then do your worst!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
