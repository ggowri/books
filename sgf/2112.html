  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the Fusion Vessel was stabilized, the next step in the merging process became astonishingly straightforward for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he had to do was integrate the space elemental essence and the dark elemental essence into their respective lotus bases.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This process felt almost effortless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elemental essence was intangible forces; only he could sense and control them. First, he focused on moving his space elemental essence toward one of the crimson lotus petals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Osborne could take further action, the petal began to assimilate the essence on its own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fusion happened swiftly, and he soon realized that nothing had changed drastically; his space elemental essence remained under his control, and he was still able to utilize his spatial power as easily as ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deep breath, Osborne now turned his attention to the dark elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost immediately, the second crimson lotus petal began to meld with his dark elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was when he felt it&mdash;a shift in energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two elemental essence, which should have been distinct and separate, started to swirl together within the Fusion Vessel. With the help of an inexplicable force, these two entirely different powers began merging rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A low hum resonated through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne noticed something startling. Both his space and dark elemental essence seemed to vanish, replaced inside the vessel by a completely new essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simultaneously, he felt a surge of unfamiliar strength welling up within his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This new power was born from the fusion of spatial energy and dark energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In some respects, it was akin to a diminished version of Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet even a diluted form of Sacred Power surpassed pure spatial or dark energies by a considerable margin. This Sacred Power possessed both spatial and dark properties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne realized he was looking at something truly remarkable&mdash;Sacred Power essence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sacred Power essence? Did I really succeed?" he whispered, pure elation flooding through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sacred Power essence was the mark of an Empyrean Sacredness warrior. It formed the very foundation of their being, their only source of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And here he was, merely an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King, already holding Sacred Power essence, thanks to the unique capabilities of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, his Sacred Power essence couldn't compare to that of an Empyrean Sacredness warrior&mdash;there was still an enormous gap between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But one thing was certain. His Sacred Power essence was vastly stronger than the space and dark elemental essence he had before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Sacred Power essence, he could wield spatial power and dark power and even launch direct attacks using the merged Sacred Power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sacred Power! Sacred Power!" Osborne murmured, raising his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a rich gray energy materialized in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This gray energy was his Sacred Power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could flicker and collapse space like spatial energy, and it carried the destructive force of dark energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, Sacred Power was incredibly formidable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Merging two different types of power didn't just add their strengths; it created something exponentially greater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne summoned his Sacred Power, transforming it into a blade, and coupled it with divine power to form a shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thrust the Sacred Power blade toward the divine power shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the shield forged from divine power shattered as easily as cutting through a piece of fragile paper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock coursed through Osborne as he stood there, dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Osborne's cultivation level was only Ascension Two, his divine power was remarkably potent. When compared to even an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King, his divine power held its ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, his divine power defenses were formidable enough that an ordinary Ascension Five Supernal Deity King would struggle to break through them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here he was, witnessing the Sacred Power blade effortlessly tear through his divine power defenses!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kind of attack surpassed the full strength of a typical Ascension Five Supernal Deity King, and all Osborne had done was tap into a fraction of his Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sacred Power! What incredible offensive strength!" he exclaimed, the excitement bubbling up inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of contemplation, he decided to test the defensive capabilities of his Sacred Power. He transformed it into a shield while shaping his divine power into a blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then struck the Sacred Power shield with all his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his astonishment, Osborne's divine power blade failed to pierce the Sacred Power shield even after dozens of strikes. It wasn't until he delivered a hundredth strike that the shield finally cracked, overwhelmed by the sheer force of his attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Wow! The defensive power of Sacred Power is astonishing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My divine power has mutated after absorbing the energy from Bloodstrike Orb, giving it incredible corrosive effects. Back when I was at Ascension One, I could slowly erode the divine power defenses of an Ascension Six Supernal Deity King with my divine power alone..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was left in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strength of Sacred Power exceeded all his expectations, making his divine power seem pitiful in comparison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And this is just a diluted version of Sacred Power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but wonder just how powerful the Sacred Power of an Empyrean Sacredness warrior truly was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "Now, I can easily use Sacred Power to perform Divine Ascendance Techniques related to darkness and space, such as Spatial Oblivion Slash, Dimensional Maw, Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes, or even Eclipse War Armor! The power of these techniques will multiply, perhaps even tenfold, thanks to Sacred Power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For instance, my Eclipse War Armor! When cast with dark power, its defensive capabilities lag behind Bloodwrought Armor. But if I use Sacred Power, the defense of Eclipse War Armor will not only match Bloodwrought Armor but could even surpass it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even an Ascension Six or Seven Supernal Deity King would find it difficult to break through my Eclipse War Armor when enhanced by Sacred Power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From now on, Sacred Power will be my primary means of combat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a sense of satisfaction with the strength of his Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a shame that my current Sacred Power is merely a fusion of spatial and dark energies. If I could also integrate thunder, physical strength, soul power, divine power, or even the essence of Satan's Eye and Death's Stare, then my Sacred Power would become even more formidable and terrifying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but feel a surge of anticipation, hoping that his Fusion Vessel would soon yield more bases, allowing him to merge even more Sacred Power into his power essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With some time left, I should really familiarize myself with this newfound Sacred Power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne realized he had already achieved his goal for this retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The magnitude of his power increase was far beyond what he had initially imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he just needed to get comfortable with his skyrocketing strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two days passed swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ten-day retreat he had agreed upon with Alfreda had come to an end, but Alfreda was still deep in her own training. Osborne hesitated, deciding not to disturb her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed Alfreda was also at a critical juncture in her cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, on the twelfth day, a surge of energy erupted from Alfreda, filling the air with an overwhelming force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda shouted, excitement radiating from her, "Finally, I've broken through!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My plant elemental essence has reached level ten, putting me on the brink of becoming a quasi-Empyrean Sacredness warrior!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My cultivation level has finally ascended to Ascension Six!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My power has skyrocketed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alfreda turned to Osborne, her eyes sparkling with excitement and a fierce determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you dare take me on?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
