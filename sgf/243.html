  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it really be a blood diamond?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's breath </span><span>quickened,</span><span> his excitement palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew all too well the legend of the blood diamond. After all, a century ago, the War of Madness sparked by these very diamonds had reshaped the power dynamics in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather's rise to dominance over the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, becoming the underground ruler of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, was deeply connected to that war.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood diamonds first emerged a hundred years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, the mine belonged to an ancient family known as the Sinclair family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A miner from the </span><span>Sinclairs</span><span> stumbled upon a fist-sized blood diamond deep within the mine. This diamond was not only of the highest quality but also imbued with a strange power. Absorbing its energy could dramatically boost one's power level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sinclair family soon discovered nearly a hundred of these high-quality blood diamonds in their mine. With the newfound strength from these gems, their power surged to match even the most formidable of old families in Newport City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But their meteoric rise drew attention. News of the blood diamonds leaked, causing an uproar across </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Offers of hundreds of billions, even trillions, poured in to buy the mine or individual blood diamonds, all of which were rejected by the Sinclair family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The conflict over these treasures led to the War of Madness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sinclair family, who had stood for a millennium, was annihilated. Nearly sixty percent of </span><span>Rosmandi's</span><span> martial masters and power masters fell in that war.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> emerged victorious and took control of the mine, their losses were severe, and they never found another blood diamond, leaving their strength diminished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> were soon overthrown by the Godfather, who took over </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> but also failed to find any more blood diamonds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Believing the blood diamonds were exhausted, the Godfather sold the mine for 15 billion ten years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was eventually acquired by the wealthy Chevalier family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the past decade, the Chevalier family had been mining the site, but they, too, had come up empty-handed regarding blood diamonds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Osborne had barely started looking and had already found one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His breath came in shallow gasps, disbelief etched across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe it's just a regular red diamond, not a blood diamond after all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne set to work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands, covered in the yellow glow of Devil's Light, dug into the rock effortlessly as though the hard stone were mere clay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within moments, he had carved out a tunnel about fifteen feet deep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the blood-red diamond came into full view, Osborne felt a surge of strange energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a blood diamond! It really is! This unique power, there's no way an ordinary red diamond would have it. This has to be the legendary blood diamond!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's breathing grew more rapid with each passing second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was acutely aware that, a century ago, people had been willing to pay a billion just for a single blood diamond, only to be turned away by the Sinclair family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A single blood diamond was worth a billion, even dozens of billions!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath, trying to steady himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see what makes a blood diamond worth so much. Why is it so fiercely sought after, even by Class A masters?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne focused his ocular energy on the blood diamond, extracting it with precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held it up to his eyes, scrutinizing it closely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aside from its striking blood-red hue, this diamond was clearly of the highest quality&mdash;perfectly clear and almost devoid of any impurities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet its true value lay in the strange power it contained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The peculiar energy seemed to seep through his pores, instantly making his entire body tingle with pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could almost feel a tremendous force beginning to coalesce within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the soul of powers!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned. He hadn't even started actively absorbing the diamond's energy yet. Just the aura emanating from the diamond was enough to make his soul of powers begin to consolidate rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne exclaimed, his voice tinged with awe, "What kind of power is this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The effects are staggering. My soul of powers, which has been elusive for so long, is starting to solidify just from absorbing a fraction of the blood diamond's energy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overwhelmed by the sensation, Osborne wasted no time and actively began to draw in the blood diamond's power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the complete form of his soul of powers manifested&mdash;a towering, robust silhouette with no visible face but a strange, silver-glowing eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Osborne's soul of powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the manifestation of his soul of powers, Osborne had finally crossed into Class B metahuman territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally, Class B!" Osborne murmured to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel his strength surging to new heights. If he were to face Derek again now, Osborne was confident he could defeat him within three moves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps even with a single, decisive blow!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Derek's soul of powers might not withstand his full force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is incredible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a rush of exhilaration as he experienced the transformation in his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Remarkably, he had only used a tenth of the blood diamond's energy so far.</span></p><div class="pagination">
