  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne murmured to himself and didn&rsquo;t think much about it. He then found a corner and sat down to wait quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tonight&rsquo;s auction was divided into two stages. One was a charity auction, and another was a treasure auction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The charity auction hadn&rsquo;t begun yet, but numerous prominent figures from Mayby City were already gathered, quietly discussing among themselves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When they saw Osborne entering through the VIP passage, their eyes lit up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, they did not recognize him and did not dare to approach him, only quietly discussing and trying to find out who he was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne ignored them, as his sole purpose for being here was to bid on the longevity herb for Anastasia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">From his conversation with Debbe earlier, he had learned that two longevity herbs would be auctioned tonight, which eased his mind considerably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now, Osborne just needed to win the bids for both longevity herbs, and Anastasia would be saved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was willing to give up everything to save Anastasia, even if it meant spending all of the millions of dollars in his account and becoming penniless again. No matter who competed with him, he would fight to the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">While thinking about this, Osborne began to practice The Breath of Celestial as he waited for the auction to officially start.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just then, the members of the Caldwell family and the Ashford family finally entered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They saw Osborne in the corner but did not dare to trouble him, as they were still unclear about why he had VIP status and did not want to act rashly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley stared intently at Osborne and asked with a grim expression, &ldquo;Is that the loser Osborne?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Wesley thought about how Ophelia had once been Osborne&rsquo;s wife, sharing a bed and having intimate moments, he felt a deep resentment toward Osborne. He would only feel at ease if Osborne were dead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Ophelia saw Wesley&rsquo;s expression, she could roughly guess what he was thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She nodded and said, &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s Osborne, my ex-husband. But don&rsquo;t worry. No one except the Caldwell family knows about our marriage. I will make sure the Caldwell family members keep it a secret.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley&rsquo;s expression softened a bit, but he soon snorted and questioned, &ldquo;What if Osborne decides to tell people himself?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia was taken aback and frowned. &ldquo;He&hellip; he probably won&rsquo;t say anything. From what I know of him, he&rsquo;s not the type to spread such things.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Oh, really?&rdquo; Wesley didn&rsquo;t believe her and responded. &ldquo;Before you guys got divorced, he willingly stayed in your shadow and didn&rsquo;t tell anyone about your relationship. But now that you&rsquo;re divorced, are you sure he won&rsquo;t say anything?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia frowned and lost confidence in her own words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley said, &ldquo;Ophelia, I don&rsquo;t want our families&rsquo; union to become a topic of gossip. If you can&rsquo;t ensure his silence, I will handle it my way. Only a dead man can keep a secret,&rdquo; he declared, his words brimming with menace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia opened her mouth as if to persuade him otherwise. However, after thinking about the importance of the Caldwell and Ashford family union, she just nodded in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make sure he leaves Mayby City and never comes back,&rdquo; she stated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley shrugged and said nothing more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As more people arrived, the news that Osborne was a VIP of the Draco Group began to spread among the prominent figures at the event. Many of them finally mustered the courage to approach him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Mr. Augustine, I am Timothy Watson, the head of the Watson family. We specialize in hotel and restaurant services. Here&rsquo;s my business card and a 50% VIP discount card for Watson Haven. Please accept it. When you have the time, I&rsquo;ll make sure to give you a warm welcome.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Mr. Augustine I am Jenny Carter, the heir of the Carter family. Here&rsquo;s my business card. Our family business focuses on transportation. I hope to have the opportunity to cooperate with you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Mr. Augustine, I am&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">All the prominent business figures and affluent individuals of Mayby City crowded around Osborne, each vying to introduce themselves and present their business cards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne felt somewhat helpless. He had already mentioned that he was just an ordinary person, not a notable figure, but these people didn&rsquo;t believe him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was because they knew that an ordinary person wouldn&rsquo;t be in this event, an ordinary person wouldn&rsquo;t be a VIP at Draco Auction House, and an ordinary person wouldn&rsquo;t have Debbe personally accompanying them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">These prominent figures were very shrewd and didn&rsquo;t believe Osborne&rsquo;s explanation. They knew that any advantage from a VIP could be highly profitable for them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">So, he simply stopped explaining and accepted every business card handed to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Some beautiful and alluring women even discreetly gave Osborne their hotel room keys, which he also took to prevent them from bugging him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Ophelia and Wesley saw this, they looked very displeased, their faces showing clear signs of jealousy and resentment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In their view, Osborne was just a nobody, yet with a fake VIP status, he was more admired than they were, surrounded by so many important figures. How could they not be jealous?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Right then, Wesley&rsquo;s phone rang. After answering the call, his eyes lit up, and a sneer appeared on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He chuckled mockingly, &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s how it is&hellip; Ophelia, it turns out that loser&rsquo;s VIP status is indeed fake. He just got lucky and received a VIP experience card.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;VIP experience card?&rdquo; Ophelia asked.</p><div class="pagination">
