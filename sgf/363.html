  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a cabin on a mountain almost 1,200 yards away from the Paltrow family's port in the Yougster, Dampston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the window of the cabin, one could see the Paltrow family's port.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade Paltrow was standing in front of the window, looking in the direction of the port with a highly solemn expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the door was pushed open, and Yaron Luther and Shawn Walker walked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wade, what's going on? What happened to the Ghost Ship?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yaron's fiery voice sounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air around him seemed to be much colder than in other places. Snowflakes condensed out of thin air and slowly fell to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wade, tell us!" said Shawn coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yaron, Shawn, the Ghost Ship has been destroyed. No one survived!" said Wade with a grim expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yaron was shocked. "What did you say? They hid long ago, and metahumans from our three ancient families guarded them. There were nine Class A- metahumans in total. How could they be wiped out?</span><span> </span><span>Could it be that a master has taken action?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn asked, "Who did it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yaron and Shawn both looked gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade shook his head. "I don't know who did it, so I hurried to find you to discuss the following arrangements.</span><span> </span><span>All I know is that the Ghost Ship dispatched five Class A- metahumans as planned to attack the Augustine family's Alisa Ship hundreds of miles away the night before yesterday.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But until now, the Alisa Ship is still floating on the sea and has not been affected too much. The five Class A- metahumans of the Ghost Ship were all dead. Only one person who did not participate in the battle drove the skeleton ship back here.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, a few hours ago, I suddenly lost contact with </span><span>it</span><span>. I immediately rushed over to check. But I saw that everyone disappeared, and even the traces were cleaned up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Wade finished speaking, Yaron and Shawn were angrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be the Augustine </span><span>family</span><span> did it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade shook his head. "No way! We are all clear about the strength of the Augustine family. If the Augustine family tried to destroy the Ghost Ship silently, Isaac must do it himself. But according to our intelligence, he has not left the Augustine Estate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it's not the Augustine family, who could it be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade frowned, "I don't know! They </span><span>left no traces behind</span><span>. I can't find any clues."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yaron and Shawn looked at each other and were both shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked serious. "</span><span>So</span><span> what are you going to do next?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade said seriously, "Nothing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yaron and Shawn were surprised. "What about our plan? You know why our three ancient families put aside our grudges and reached an agreement! The Augustine family is only our first target. If we can't even destroy the Augustine family, what are we doing together? How can we occupy Dampston?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade said calmly, "We can't be so hasty to occupy Dampston! There are nine ancient families in Dampston. Our three families are indeed the strongest. But once the news leaks out and the other six families join forces, it will be difficult for us to fight against them.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The most important thing now is to wait and see what happens! We must figure out who destroyed the Ghost Ship and who is targeting us. We need to find out whether they know our plan before we continue to act!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, we can't do anything now.</span><span> </span><span>We can only wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yaron and Shawn looked at each other. There was some reluctance in their eyes, but they finally nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that it is the only way!</span><span> </span><span>Fortunately, the Augustine family is already weak. Even if we don't take action, they won't be able to hold on for long. They can't recover their former strength!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You need to investigate it as soon as possible!</span><span> </span><span>If we can't even destroy the Augustine family, there's no need for us to join forces," said Yaron coldly.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he turned and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn </span><span>uttered</span><span>, "Wade, the alliance was initiated by the Paltrow family. You should </span><span>devote </span><span>more and investigate the matter as soon as possible. We don't want to wait too long!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he also walked out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reaching the door, he suddenly stopped and added, "By the way, I heard that Alexander is about to be a Class A master. Congratulate him for me. Once he becomes a master, I will definitely congratulate him in person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Shawn left quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade was still standing in front of the window, looking at the port in the distance. After he was sure that Yaron and Shawn were far away, he suddenly snorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two bastards. You throw everything to the Paltrow family and want to reap the benefits.</span><span> </span><span>Do you really think that the Paltrow family wants to share the benefits of Dampston with you? After Alexander becomes a master, the Paltrow family's real plan will be launched!</span><span> </span><span>By then, even you will be destroyed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dampston will belong to the Paltrow family in the future. The Paltrow family will become the only overlord of Dampston!</span><span> </span><span>Just wait and see!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After muttering, Wade turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he disappeared, a bolt of lightning suddenly appeared and hit the cabin accurately. It instantly turned into coke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Wade didn't notice that a beautiful woman slowly walked out from the shadows shortly after he left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stroked her smooth chin and looked in the direction the three had left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should I help him clear up some obstacles?</span><span> </span><span>The trials Godfather set up for him are becoming more complex and troublesome. How much time will it take for him to complete all the trials by himself?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's too troublesome!</span><span> </span><span>I can't wait any longer!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
