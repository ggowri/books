  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra looked at Osborne worriedly. Osborne won easily this time and didn't even have any external injuries. But Kendra was still worried whether he had internal injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa also looked at Osborne with a weird expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long while, she finally said, "Good job. But don't be proud. They are just Class A- metahumans. Class A- metahumans are all losers. The real masters won't pay any attention to them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "I know. I won't be proud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, I want to take these two away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They killed Allen, the head of the Augustine family. I promised to bring them back and hand them over to the Augustine family for execution. The others are all your experimental subjects."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded and waved her hand, saying, "No problem. Take them away. I will find someone to help you clear the traces so that no one will find out that you did it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Isa in gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I'll go back to the Alisa Ship first. I'll come to you later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa opened her mouth and wanted to say she didn't want him to come to her. But she didn't say it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just waved her hand in annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne did not notice Isa's abnormal behavior. He used the strong wind to pick up Webster and Evan and flew to the Alisa Ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, this place was closer to Pinchide City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ghost Ship had been destroyed, so the Alisa Ship would no longer be in danger. Osborne could directly return to the Augustine Estate in Pinchide City without going back to the Alisa Ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne still chose to return to the Alisa Ship because he didn't want to be suspected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Paltrow family, the Walker family, and the Luther family had lost many metahumans because of the complete collapse of the Ghost Ship. They would definitely investigate who had done it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they found out that Osborne left the Alisa Ship and returned to the Augustine Estate during this period, they would suspect him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Osborne had to return to the Alisa Ship before dawn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only people who knew that he had left the Alisa Ship were Yulissa, Ryan, Nathan, Jacob, and Layla. If the news still leaked out, the traitor in the Augustine family must be one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hours later, Osborne finally returned to the Alisa Ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the sky slowly got bright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa didn't sleep the whole night. Two combat robots guarded her, and she couldn't even leave the room. She could only stay on the sofa, worrying about Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't stand up until the door was opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne coming back safely, she was immediately pleased. But when she saw Webster and Evan Osborne grabbed, she was suddenly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, who are they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said calmly, "They killed your father. His name is Webster, the leader of the Ghost Ship, and also a member of The Wise Order of the Paltrow family. The other one is Evan, a member of The Wise Order of the Walker family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne threw the two in front of Yulissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I promised you that I would capture your father's murderers alive and hand them over to you. Now I have done it. You can do whatever you want with them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Did they kill my father?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Webster?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evan?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Members of The Wise Order of the Paltrow family and the Walker family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa's body trembled. Fear appeared in her eyes. She knew very well what the Paltrow family and the Walker family represented in Dampston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, the urge for revenge overwhelmed her fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lip and looked at the two angrily. She then attacked them madly, venting the pain in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa's mother had died of complications during childbirth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been raised alone by her father, Allen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But these two bastards had killed her father!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa had sworn to find the murderer and avenge her father, even if giving up everything, even her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, The Wise Order of the Augustine family had decided not to support her revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all had thought she was just a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Osborne actually brought the murderers back and handed them over to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could she bear it any longer? She cried and vented her anger and hatred on Webster and Evan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at her and couldn't help but sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long time, Yulissa finally stopped because she was tired. Webster and Evan, who were lying on the ground, had long lost their human form. There was not a single piece of skin intact on their bodies. They looked extremely miserable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they were not dead yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Yulissa decided to hand them over to The Wise Order of the Augustine family for execution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Allen was not only her father but also the head of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family should execute the murderers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa was tired. She suddenly threw herself into Osborne's arms and hugged him tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for catching them so that I could avenge my father! Thank you for everything you have done for me. Everyone treats me like a child, but you are the only one who takes me seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you. Thank you so much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa cried, and her tears instantly wet a large area of Osborne's clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could only pat her back gently to comfort her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only after Yulissa fell into a deep sleep did Osborne carefully carry her to the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to leave. But he found that Yulissa was holding his sleeve tightly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
