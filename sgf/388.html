  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the transformation, Osborne's energy and blood ball resembled a dazzling ruby, radiating a powerful blood-red light with faint purple flashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a purple thunderbolt!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the energy and blood ball seemed to have completely completed its transformation and rushed into Osborne's dry body, causing rapid changes to take place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His dry muscles began to plump up once more while his wrinkled skin regained elasticity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a few moments, Osborne's body had returned to its original vitality from its withered state, but his transformation was not over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His muscle definition became more pronounced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His skin grew more resilient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After half a day, all these changes finally ended. At that moment, Osborne, who was naked, looked like a flawless statue without excess fat. His perfection was evident from every angle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart pounded fiercely, resonating with a rumbling sound akin to thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood in his veins surged wildly like a mighty river or sea running with a gurgling sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, all the cells in Osborne's body gushed out a red light, enveloping his entire body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the martial art aura!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was exclusive to Class A martial masters, achievable only through the condensation of their entire body's energy and blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the martial art aura, Osborne became a true Class A martial master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally opened his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his confusion, he quickly grasped the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I succeeded!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I actually made it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Class A martial master!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have become a Class A martial master!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was exhilarated beyond measure. Sensing the formidable power coursing through his body, he couldn't contain his excitement. The whole world seemed to have become different and clearer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His life has leaped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His soul also underwent a transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally ascended to Class A and became a master worldwide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took him a long time to calm down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank goodness for the Breath of Celestial! Without it, I would have perished. Its mystical power has surprised me. Only as a Class A martial master can I fully harness its effects."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep, long breath, like a whale sucking in water, drawing all the air from his room. Simultaneously, he found the power within his body intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Breath of Celestial is an ancient cultivation method from Glacium. Now, I have truly entered the realm of the first level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Every breath I take can boost my strength by about ten percent! But don't underestimate it. In a battle where strengths are evenly matched, this ten-percent increase can decisively sway the outcome, determining life and death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, this is only the effect of the first level of the Breath of Celestial!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are nine levels in total!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At the first level, one breath boosts my strength by ten percent! At the second level, it is twenty percent! It jumps to forty percent at the third level and eighty percent at the fourth level! Moving to the fifth level doubles my strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I can achieve the fifth level and increase my strength by twice, it will be incredibly terrifying! And reaching the sixth level quadruples my strength. The seventh raises it eightfold, and the ninth multiplies it twentyfold.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At the peak of the ninth level, my strength surges a hundredfold with just a single breath!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A hundredfold!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was thrilled, looking forward to practicing the Breath of Celestial to the ninth level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, any martial artist at his level would likely perish from a poke of his little finger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that was very difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne swiftly dismissed the thought. The ninth level of the Breath of Celestial was still far beyond his reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he needed to do now was to continue to enhance his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have become a Class A martial master. Therefore, it is impossible to upgrade my level in a short period. But in this state, I'm still not capable enough to rescue Clarissa from the Paltrow Estate!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So next, I have to go to Isa and improve my fighting skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, how long did it take me to reach Class A this time? I hope it was not too long!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly glanced at the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pondered, "It only took two days! How quick! I expected it to be at least seven days! Doesn't that mean today is exactly when the Maritime Auction starts?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Maritime Auction, organized jointly by the Augustine family and the Draco Group, was of immense scale and spanned a full seven days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logically speaking, no one would dare to cause trouble at an auction hosted by the Draco Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there were always exceptions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly realized that the Draco Group might not be able to scare everyone, such as the Aberrants!</span></p><div class="pagination">
