  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The main auction venue was set up on the Alisa Ship, while bidders on other cruise ships could only bid online through the Draco Group's virtual equipment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, no one would pay a high price to auction jewelry based on just a few photos without a close look and appraisal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why the first three days of the jewelry display were especially important.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A special operation team would take all the jewels to be auctioned to other cruise ships in small boats for the guests to observe and appraise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, they would bring the jewelry back to the Alisa Ship for the actual auction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There could never be any accidents in this process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once something happened to them, and the jewelry was lost or robbed during the transfer, the auction could not be held successfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will the Aberrants attack while the jewels are being transferred? Or could there be anyone among the passengers who would be greedy enough to rob them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought that everything was possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the transfer of the jewelry was handled by the Draco Group, so Osborne was relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just in case, Osborne opened the Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the plan, the special operation team was now transferring all the jewels from the Alisa Ship to the Stellar cruise ship, where the guests on the Stellar cruise ship would observe and appraise the jewels closely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two cruise ships weren't far from each other, only about 1.2 miles apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had at most five minutes to complete the transfer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a thick fog appeared on the sea, but it could not hide from the Satan's Eye of Osborne, and he easily found the special operation team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were six ships and about forty men in total, each of them armed and rapidly breaking the waves as they approached the Stellar cruise ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, they arrived at the Stellar cruise ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything went smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that the jewels had all been transferred to the Stellar cruise ship, and that there had been no accidents in the process, Osborne was finally relieved that he had put away Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He returned to his room and continued to cultivate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's physical quality had already advanced to the level of Class A martial masters, and he wasn't likely to have a big breakthrough in a short time. Osborne focused his cultivation on power again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first thing he had to do was to integrate the metal elemental essence into the Devil's Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The metal elemental essence was the seventh elemental essence Osborne had gotten, and once he successfully integrated it, he would possess the blue Devil's Light at level six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the process of integration would be incredibly difficult and dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hadn't dared to integrate them because he was afraid that he couldn't withstand it physically. After all, when he integrated the Devil's Light at level five, his body had almost broken down. If he didn't have the blood diamonds, he would have already died at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Osborne had been a Class A martial master, his physical qualities were many times stronger than before, and all of his life levels had been greatly enhanced, completely different from before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne could finally integrate the metal elemental essence into the Devil's Light at level six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne had guessed, his current body could completely withstand the power of integrating the Devil's Light at level six, so he could easily finish the integration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The color of his Devil's Light transformed from a light cyan to a light blue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the blue Devil's Light at level six!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was satisfied. It would be a huge boost to his power with the leveling up of the Devil's Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, there were no enemies for him to test.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the next three days, Osborne locked himself in his room. He used Satan's Eye to observe the special operation team while absorbing the blood diamonds to boost his soul of powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His soul of powers had reached the height of ninety-nine yards a long time ago, and he was just a little bit short of reaching one hundred yards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The achievement of one hundred yards was the opportunity for him to become a Class A Power Master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the process from ninety-nine yards to one hundred yards was incomparably slow and difficult for Osborne. He had already absorbed the energy of three blood diamonds, but his soul of powers remained at ninety-nine yards, only becoming more skillful and real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hadn't reached the opportunity for a breakthrough yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't get anxious. Even if his soul of powers reached one hundred yards right away, he wouldn't become a Class A Power Master right now, and he had to wait for the auction to end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three days passed quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the plan, the special operation team would soon transfer all the jewels from the Voyager cruise ship two miles away to the Alisa Ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This would be the last transfer of jewelry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, all the jewels would be auctioned off on the Alisa Ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The jewels had been transferred more than twenty times in the past three days, and Osborne had opened his Satan's Eye each time to observe them secretly, but there had been no accidents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was gradually reassured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought the Aberrants weren't going to rob the jewels during their transfer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, still using his usual Satan's Eye, stared into the darkness at the special operation team, thinking that he would be able fine as usual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was at this moment that the unexpected happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dozen men suddenly appeared on the deck of the Voyager cruise ship. They looked down at the special operation team and put the boxes with the jewels on the boat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, they made their move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Powerful energy fluctuations erupted from each of their bodies, and one of them just gently waved his hand, and a huge wave was instantly lifted from the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, all six small boats from the special operation team were engulfed by the waves.</span></p><div class="pagination">
