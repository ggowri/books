  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression hardened dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You mean to tell me that the gods who didn't completely die, including the Dark Deities, will all awaken?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt the weight of the situation pressing down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The star power in the air was so dense that it felt like it was seeping into his body, even without him trying to absorb it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne realized that even if he didn't actively cultivate, his power would gradually increase, and it wouldn't be long before he reached the upper limits of Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, he might become a deity himself soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was highly likely that there would be a surge of powerful individuals emerging on the Blue Planet in the near future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what truly sent a chill down his spine was the thought of the gods and Dark Deities who had been severely injured in the great war among the gods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With such a rich influx of power, their strength would recover rapidly. Recovery was always quicker than training!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's voice turned serious as he asked, "So, during the divine war, were there many gods and Dark Deities who survived?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa replied calmly, "Quite a few! But I can't say exactly how many.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, they're gods&mdash;they have their own ways of surviving. Some, like the God of Time, enter reincarnation and wait for their new bodies to recover. Others, like the God of Star locked away in the Augustine family's dungeon, may have had their physical forms destroyed, but their Divine Souls endure. Once they regain power, they can reshape their Divine Bodies and restore their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've seen the God of Star, haven't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, then asked, "What about those five god corpses controlled by Gerardo? Can they come back to life too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa responded, "Of course! But their Divine Souls are long gone, leaving only their Divine Bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if they receive power, regenerating a Divine Soul won't be easy. And without memories, they wouldn't be the same gods anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If someone were to control them, they could easily turn to evil!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned again; concern etched on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa continued, "But the real danger lies with the Dark Deities! Their vitality is stronger than that of ordinary gods, and they're far more aggressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is going to bring trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's hope these Dark Deities don't cause too much chaos! Come on, let me show you the changes happening in the world!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa grabbed Osborne's hand as they descended from the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They landed on a small, desolate island.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was barren, with only a few scraggly trees, but Osborne could see that under the starlight, these trees were growing at an astonishing pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this rate, the island would soon be transformed into a lush jungle, with tiny saplings turning into towering trees bursting with greenery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of this was thanks to the star power, which had increased a hundredfold or thousandfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, they ventured into the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne noticed that the fish and shrimp were now incredibly lively, moving faster and growing at an unprecedented rate. Every creature in the water seemed more agile and fierce than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The underwater vegetation was also thriving wildly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The changes were happening at breakneck speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that was just the beginning. Isa then led Osborne to an ordinary city, where they hovered above a hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, patients were lined up to check out with their ailments miraculously healed! They watched in awe as people who had once been bedridden stood up, full of life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even those diagnosed with terminal illnesses were recovering rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The plants inside the hospital were also growing uncontrollably, with roots breaking through the earth and tree canopies obscuring the building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire world was transforming at an astonishing pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At this rate, entire cities might get swallowed by the jungle!" Osborne's brow furrowed deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa simply smiled, "Isn't that wonderful? The environment will become better than ever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained silent, weighing his worries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He feared how quickly-paced these changes might overwhelm the average person and what disasters they might bring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But eventually, he decided not to dwell on it. This transformation was happening globally. At first, people might panic, but eventually, they would adapt and become used to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ordinary people would gradually awaken their power, becoming metahumans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "When everyone becomes a metahuman and wields power, the world might descend into chaos without even Dark Deities getting involved. But someone will have to step up, like governments around the world..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression grew grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't tell if such drastic changes were good or bad for the world, but he knew his own power couldn't alter the course of events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, he figured he had to let things take their natural course.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa said, "Let's go. We need to check on the God of Star. I promised him I'd help reshape his Divine Body. Now's the time to fulfill that promise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Isa led Osborne to the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The estate was undergoing a startling transformation. Of the Augustine Estate's nine peaks, only Mount Celestial Reach and Challenge Peak remained untouched, while the rest were being overrun by wild growth.</span></p><div class="pagination">
