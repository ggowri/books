  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their reinforcement is here already?! That's fast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star's expression turned incredibly grave, but instead of halting, she accelerated her actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a thunderous roar echoed, rolling in like a storm. The Augustine family's Junior Deities felt their blood surge uncontrollably, their faces turning pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all looked towards the southern sky, astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next second, a figure sped towards them with terrifying velocity, aiming directly for Joseph and his companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! Trying to save them from me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dream on! I'm not stupid enough to let you rescue them, only to have them gang up on me again! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, the God of Star unleashed her power. Countless rays pierced through Joseph and his companions, instantly dissolving their bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph and his group, who had momentarily shown excitement and hope at the sight of the Deschanel Clan's Transcendent Deity warrior, were frozen in the next second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling their bodies dissolve rapidly, they tried to speak but found no chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, they were all dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a grave expression, the God of Star faced the southern sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A figure finally stopped about half a mile away from the God of Star, his face gloomy and menacing as he looked at the completely dissolved bodies of the five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're looking for death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you not hear me when I told you to stop?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Transcendent Deity warrior of the Deschanel Clan glared at the God of Star. He was a middle-aged man, strikingly handsome but with a cold, fierce glint in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star remained calm. "If I told you to stop, would you? So why should I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon Deschanel barked, "Because I am Eamon Deschanel of the Deschanel Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you kill five Superior Deity elders of my clan in front of me? I don't care who you are; you're as good as dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, Eamon attacked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star snorted, "Step back! A battle between Transcendent Deity warriors is not something you can interfere with. Even the aftershock of our fight could severely injure or kill you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry and find Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There might be more than one Transcendent Deity warrior in the Deschanel Clan. I can't hold him off for long! Get Osborne to figure something out, or not even I can save the Augustine family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the God of Star charged forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fierce battle between the two Transcendent Deity warriors erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star transformed into a blinding light, while Eamon unleashed his divine power like a raging tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer terror of the battle made it clear, even without the God of Star's warning, that Sebastian and Anastasia had to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were Junior Deities, after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing a Superior Deity, they might hold their ground for a while, but against a Transcendent Deity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their Divine Bodies were too fragile!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, what do we do now? God of Star told us to find Osborne! But even if Osborne isn't in seclusion, what can he do?" Anastasia frowned deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they had suspected the Deschanel Clan might have a power beyond Superior Deity, witnessing it firsthand was shocking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a Transcendent Deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And God of Star had suggested there might be more than one in the Deschanel Clan. How could they possibly stand against such power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Osborne were here, what could he do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In everyone's mind, he was only a Junior Deity, after all. In the face of a Transcendent Deity warrior, he was as weak as an ant. What hope did they have?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian watched the fierce battle between the God of Star and Eamon with bated breath, grinding his teeth as he barked orders, "Maybe it's time we prepare for a run for our lives!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, get ready to bolt at a moment's notice!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And send someone to inform Osborne; I'd rather not disturb him while he's in seclusion, but we're at the brink of extinction. We have no choice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd nodded in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tensions were palpable as everyone swiftly prepared for the worst. The thought of God of Star faltering against the Deschanel Clan's onslaught sent shivers down their spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luck seemed to be on their side, as Osborne possessed formidable spatial power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only they could rouse him from his meditative state, they might stand a chance of fleeing to some obscure corner the Deschanel Clan wouldn't easily scout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, that hope was abruptly shattered when a grim report reached them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? A potent energy barrier surrounds Osborne's chamber? It's impenetrable and prevents us from even attempting to awaken him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's face darkened with dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Osborne's spatial power, their escape route was effectively sealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dire implications for the myriad Augustine family members hung heavily over them. How many of the tens of thousands could possibly survive such a cataclysm?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's visage mirrored the collective despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, the skies to the south crackled with fresh waves of potent energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deschanel Clan's reinforcements had arrived. The already dire situation now spiraled beyond all hope.</span></p><div class="pagination">
