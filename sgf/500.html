  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Bryce in disbelief, thinking he must have misheard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bryce wants to give the Trident of Poseidon to Clarissa? Why? The Trident of Poseidon is the legendary weapon of Poseidon, a true divine artifact. Bryce was only called the Supreme Overlord because of the Trident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, without the Trident of Poseidon, Bryce's power was merely Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Bryce possibly give away the Trident of Poseidon? If it were me, I would never do such a thing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was also shocked, holding Poseidon's Trident with a bewildered expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Osborne for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned and asked, "Bryce, did you drink too much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce grinned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think the Trident is too precious? Am I out of my mind to give it away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Bryce said seriously, "Don't worry. I know what I'm doing. In fact, I am reluctant </span><span>to part with the Trident of Poseidon because it has made me so powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now, I must give it away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because someone told me that if I wanted to break through, I had to give it up. Only by relinquishing my dependence on it could I truly push my limits and become the Supreme Overlord."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, "Then you could give it to your sister Kendra. After you break through, it will still be yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce shook his head with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First, Kendra's extra energy is unique. She cannot use the Trident of Poseidon, so giving it to her would be a waste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Second, if the Trident were with Kendra, I could retrieve it at any time, which wouldn't serve its purpose. I would still subconsciously rely on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Third, and most importantly, this is why I want to give it to Clarissa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was confused. "What reason?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce's expression became serious. "Because Clarissa is a </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span>. Fate is the most mysterious thing. Everyone's fate seems predetermined, yet it appears mutable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I give it to the </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span>, I believe the Goddess of Fate will look after me even more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Bryce laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt speechless. But after considering it, he nodded. "Then thank you. We will temporarily keep the Trident of Poseidon for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce quickly nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took another glance at the Trident, his eyes filled with reluctance, but he still averted his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should leave here quickly. I need to deal with the battlefield. I cannot let anyone find out Chris and Bruce were killed by you, or you will be in trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for how to use the Trident, I will send it to you later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was somewhat touched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, he said nothing more, just replied, "Thank you. We will remember your kindness and repay it in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took Clarissa and drove away in the yacht.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce watched the two disappear, gradually revealing a sad expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Trident..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce shouted in reluctance, then gritted his teeth and began to handle the surrounding battle traces, leaving behind his power fluctuations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to leave, a figure suddenly appeared in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce was startled. Upon realizing it was Isa, he immediately adopted a respectful demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lady Witch, why are you back again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa answered, "I never left. You are clever to have given the Trident to the </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce's eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just took a gamble. Could this act really benefit me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa chuckled, "Of course, and greatly. However, it's not the kind of benefit you think. You'll know when the time comes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, you did well. Go back and refine properly. Do not get involved in the upcoming war with </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>. At least, don't participate until you break through Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope the next time I see </span><span>you,</span><span> you will be a in Class S expert."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Isa turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce suddenly asked, "Lady Witch, do you know the </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span> is Osborne's girlfriend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa stopped in her tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned her head and coldly looked at Bryce, saying, "So what if I know? None of your business. I think you need a lesson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Isa kicked Bryce into the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice continued, "Although the </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span> is also his girlfriend, I am his chief girlfriend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, Isa had disappeared without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce emerged from the </span><span>water,</span><span> his face filled with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mumbled, "Chief girlfriend? This world is truly crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Osborne really is a genius."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce revealed an envious expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, Osborne and Clarissa finally returned to the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their return, </span><span>Dampston</span><span> was about to undergo a complete transformation.</span></p><div class="pagination">
