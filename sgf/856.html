  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, invitations from the Augustine family were being dispatched to major superpowers around the globe, and the reactions varied widely.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Most superpowers had little familiarity with Osborne, and their immediate response upon receiving the invitation was a chorus of confusion.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who on earth is Osborne?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why on earth is the Augustine family hosting an Honor Quest Ceremony for him? Have they lost their minds?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they scoured the Godson Rankings, they found themselves puzzled, unable to locate Osborne's name.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, disbelief washed over them.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A person who hasn't even made it onto the Godson Rankings is planning to hold an Honor Quest Ceremony? Is this some kind of joke?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They sprang into action, sending out teams to dig up information on Osborne. Speculations flew that he might be a secret prodigy cultivated by the Augustine family, someone who had never publicly showcased his abilities, hence his absence from the rankings.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, the results of their investigations left them even more astonished.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's achievements began to surface&mdash;like his impressive victories in the Augustine family's Branch Bloodline Competition, where he had defeated Sam and David, earning the title of prospective heir while still only Class A.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then there was the time he had lucked out in the heir selection process, clinching the top spot and becoming the Augustine family's first heir; even then, he was merely Class AA.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The superpowers were left dumbfounded as they processed Osborne's background and accomplishments.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just half a month ago, he was a Class AA?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now he was set to host an Honor Quest Ceremony?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was absurd!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Almost everyone in the superpowers thought the Augustine family had truly lost their marbles, planning an Honor Quest Ceremony for a Class AA heir.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Such an event would surely turn into a public spectacle of humiliation!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, since the Augustine family had sent out invitations, they felt obliged to attend. The younger generation of powerhouses, who had just returned from Tethynia, were gearing up for another trip to Rosmandi.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, this time, most of them were heading out with a sense of morbid curiosity, eager to witness the spectacle unfold.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, in Rosmandi, the secluded Lambert family's residence, Stuart held up the invitation from the Augustine family, unable to contain his laughter.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Rhett, Vivian, come check this out!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Augustine family is throwing an Honor Quest Ceremony for their first heir, Osborne, and they've invited us! Can you believe it?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He doubled over with laughter.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This Osborne was just Class AA half a month ago! Even if he has some talent, scraping by to break into Class AAA in such a short time would be a stretch!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hosting an Honor Quest Ceremony for someone like that? Please! I could wipe the floor with him and snag the divine artifact along with that massive 500 billion reward!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Stuart finished, Rhett and Vivian joined him, their expressions a mix of surprise and skepticism.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett said, "Is this a prank or something? Sure, the Augustine family is the oldest clan in Rosmandi, but their younger generation is a mixed bag, lacking real strength! They're not even on par with us.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Honestly, the only one from the Augustine family who has broken into Class AAA is Vincent, and not a single one has made it onto the Godson Rankings, not even close!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivian looked puzzled.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are they really throwing an Honor Quest Ceremony for this Class AA Osborne? There must be some mistake!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett's expression turned serious as he replied, "Stuart, Vivian, don't underestimate Class AA! Have you forgotten about Axell? He was just Class AA, too! Without him, we would have faced serious humiliation in Tethynia!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart and Vivian exchanged glances, a shiver running through them at the mention of Axell.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart said, "But that's different! Axell is a true genius! He was strong even at Class AA! What's Osborne? He doesn't hold a candle to Axell!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if Axell were to host the Honor Quest Ceremony, it wouldn't be enough. It would turn into a spectacle of disgrace. An Honor Quest Ceremony is meant to challenge the world's top talents, and Class AA simply can't handle that kind of brutal gauntlet.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Cuthbert, ranked thirty-sixth in the Godson Rankings, couldn't even manage fifty consecutive wins.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anyway, I think the Augustine family has lost their minds. This Honor Quest Ceremony is bound to be a disaster! Even though we have a decent relationship with them, there's nothing we can do but watch the show."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A smirk of amusement played across Stuart's face.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett shook his head, choosing to remain silent.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Aleena walked over, her expression icy and severe.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stuart, do you even know who Osborne is?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart looked puzzled. "Of course I do. He's the new heir of the Augustine family, right? Is there something else I'm missing?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aleena's voice was cold. "I didn't want to tell you this, but I didn't expect you to mock Osborne and prepare to watch his downfall!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since you're so keen to laugh at him, let me set the record straight.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne is actually 'Axell.' The Axell who went with you to Tethynia last time was actually Osborne in disguise! He fought for you, avenged you, and even risked his life to cover for you.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So you're making fun of him?!"</p><div class="pagination">
