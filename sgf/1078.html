  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally returning to the Augustine Estate, Osborne was met with a scene of utter devastation. The remnants of battle littered the ground&mdash;ruins of what had once been a thriving stronghold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bodies were sprawled everywhere: members of the Augustine family, members of other factions, and most disturbingly, countless clones from the Aberrants that he recognized all too well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face paled as horror sunk in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything Wesson had warned him about was coming true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The great conflict had erupted, and the Augustine family had suffered catastrophic losses, leaving the area in shambles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anastasia had, for some reason, remained behind at Mount Celestial Reach, holed up in one of its safe houses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of that, given the circumstances, was agonizing to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could a simple safe house really withstand the Class S liked Gerardo?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic gripped Osborne; there was no time to waste. Osborne took off toward Mount Celestial Reach as if the very wind were urging him forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, don't let anything happen to her! Anastasia, you absolutely must not get harmed! I went through so much trouble to heal your strange illness! We were finally on the verge of leading a normal life, so please, you must stay safe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's strides were swift and purposeful, and before he knew it, he was standing at the threshold of Mount Celestial Reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, a chill swept over him as he sensed two overwhelming powers within&mdash;one he knew all too well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Gerardo!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Disturbingly, both forces were located near Anastasia's safe house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what made his heart race in fear was the absence of her energy signature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His color drained away, a gnawing dread creeping into his veins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, this can't be happening! Anastasia wouldn't be in trouble! She's safe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne repeated to himself, wild disbelief fueling his run toward the entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he approached the safe house, he spotted Gerardo and Armstrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo had three deep gashes on his neck, healing rapidly, but his icy gaze was locked onto Osborne, brimming with malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne ignored Gerardo's presence, focusing solely on the safe house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, the sight that greeted him froze him in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nothing remained but a dark pool of blood seeping into the corner, stark against the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body trembled uncontrollably, rage and sorrow battling within him, and his eyes blazed red as he turned to face Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted, "Gerardo! Where's my sister!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was low and seething, each word dripping with an intensity that threatened to erupt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sister?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo raised an eyebrow in surprise before wearing a sinister smile. He feigned a regretful shrug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you've returned too late! Your sister? I killed her! You see, she had this peculiar ability to release her power in defense, and I was caught off guard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gestured to the injuries on his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So naturally, I had to retaliate. I not only took her life but ensured her body was completely obliterated, leaving no trace for anyone to find.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had no idea she was your sister! If I had known, I would have preserved her body so you could see her one last time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's world tilted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind raced as the enormity of the words sank in. "Anastasia... Killed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By Gerardo?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She's gone, just like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaking, he swayed as despair tightened its grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was consuming the lie without noticing the clues hidden beneath Gerardo's triumphant taunts, failing to realize that the marks on Gerardo's neck were too severe to be from Anastasia's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne had completely lost his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One thought echoed relentlessly in his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia is dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Memories of their time together flooded back, each one more vivid than the last. He remembered the day he was just ten years old, bullied at the orphanage, and how he had run away into the streets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Starving and weak, he scavenged for food, his stomach growling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne found himself rummaging through a dumpster, fighting off a stray dog for scraps. At last, he managed to snatch a filthy bread from the dog's jaws. He was so hungry that he didn't care about the grime; he took huge bites, desperate to fill his empty belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, out of the corner of his eye, Osborne caught a glimpse of something that made his heart stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There, amidst the trash, were two bright, pleading eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were Anastasia's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lay buried under a pile of garbage, her tiny frame almost completely hidden, except for those wide, yearning eyes that were fixed on him&mdash;or rather, on the bread he clutched tightly in his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, something inside Osborne softened. Despite his own hunger, he felt an overwhelming urge to help. Without a second thought, Osborne tore off half of the bread and handed it to the starving little girl before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From that moment on, he gained a sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten-year-old Osborne, now with five-year-old Anastasia by his side, embarked on a life of wandering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They found shelter under bridges when they were tired and scoured dumpsters when hunger gnawed at their insides. Whenever someone bullied Anastasia, Osborne was there to protect her fiercely. And each time Osborne faced trouble, Anastasia would unleash her inner lioness, charging into the fray to defend him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weren't blood siblings, but their bond was stronger than that of many who shared the same bloodline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Years passed, and Osborne eventually went to college. But then, just when life seemed to settle, tragedy struck. At only thirteen, Anastasia fell ill with a mysterious disease.</span></p><div class="pagination">
