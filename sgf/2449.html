  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took out the Warfare Scythe again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though the Magma Devourer was dead, its body remained incredibly tough. After all, it was a Silicon-based Lifeform, so its body was far harder than that of a Carbon-based Lifeform.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It is said that in the depths of the universe, the bodies of the most powerful Silicon-based Lifeforms are incredibly tough. Even the explosion of a massive star cannot cause any damage to their bodies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With just their bodies, they can roam freely across the universe, ignoring almost all warriors' attacks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Magma Devourer is naturally not that terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But cutting its corpse with an ordinary Sacred Artifact is like using a dull knife to cut leather. While it&rsquo;s possible, the process would exhaust a person.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the Warfare Scythe is different.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After fusing with the Necrosnake's fangs, its sharpness exceeded Osborne's expectations. With a slight effort, it sliced through the Magma Devourer's body as if cutting paper.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the Magma Devourer's body was too massive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Marrow Crystal was tightly fused with its body. Osborne couldn't extract it directly using Satan's Eye's ocular energy, so he had to slowly cut through its body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Using Satan's Eye, it still took him ten minutes to finally extract the Marrow Crystal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a dark red crystal the size of a human head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On it, Osborne sensed intense energy fluctuations. The moment it appeared, he felt all the pores on his body open up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The power of the Marrow Crystal had an incredibly strong pull on his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not bad, such a large Marrow Crystal. If you fully absorb it, it&rsquo;s enough to push your body to the advanced Sacredness Level, maybe even further."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial stood on Osborne's shoulder at this moment, looking at the Marrow Crystal and nodding in satisfaction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very happy at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though his body reaching the advanced Sacredness Level wouldn&rsquo;t make him as powerful as the Magma Devourer, it would still be a significant boost to his strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the stronger his body, the greater his power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And his physical strength had already merged into Sacred Power. The stronger his physical strength, the stronger his Sacred Power would be.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The body of the Human Community may never compare to Silicon-based Lifeforms, but the advantages of the Human Community are unmatched by Silicon-based Lifeforms! I just need to maximize my strengths and compensate for my weaknesses as much as possible, and I can become a top warrior."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stored the Marrow Crystal into Satan Space and let Satan's Eye absorb it for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the energy of the Marrow Crystal was incredibly dense. Even with Satan's Eye helping Osborne absorb it, it couldn't be fully absorbed in a short time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wasn't in a hurry and continued dissecting the Magma Devourer's corpse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, collect the Magma Devourer's shells and feed them to the Warfare Ancient Tree! They are incredibly tough and excellent materials for crafting supreme Sacred Artifacts. The Warfare Ancient Tree will break them down, extract their essence, and integrate it into your Warfare Shield."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, your Warfare Shield will be sturdier with enhanced defense! It might even directly upgrade to a Superior Sacred Artifact. In the future, breaking through to become a Legendary Sacred Artifact won't be too difficult."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial directed Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt delighted. He quickly collected the Magma Devourer's shells and fed them directly to the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In addition, the Magma Devourer's flesh and bones also belong to the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This flesh carries fire attribute power, which the Warfare Ancient Tree can extract and integrate into the Bloodwrought Bow, enhancing its power and level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to Primordial, with the Magma Devourer's flesh and bones, Osborne's Bloodwrought Bow will soon become a Mid-grade Sacred Artifact, carrying even stronger fire attribute power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, take out all his Energy Vortex!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Primordial continued to command, "The Energy Vortex of Silicon-based Lifeforms is a treasure. It can be integrated into comprehensive Sacred Artifacts like warships, palaces, or thrones to enhance energy output efficiency, directly optimizing speed, defense, and power!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"These Energy Vortexes can be integrated into the Ascending Sacred Sanctum with the help of the Warfare Ancient Tree! This way, the repair speed of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum will be faster, and once it's fully restored, it will become even stronger."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt excited once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he ignored his fatigue and extracted the Energy Vortexes from the Magma Devourer's body one by one, handing them directly to the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the Warfare Ancient Tree became the busiest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, it was very happy because the materials from the Magma Devourer's body not only benefited Osborne but also greatly enhanced itself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, the Magma Devourer was dismantled by Osborne until only two massive eyes were left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were like two massive red gemstones.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And they were treasures as well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial suggested, "Merge them into the Ascending Sacred Sanctum! Combined with those Energy Vortexes, these two eyes can unleash incredibly powerful attacks!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne complied.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When everything was over, he was so exhausted that he could barely lift his arms. The Magma Devourer's body was simply too massive, and even with the Warfare Scythe, cutting it apart wasn't easy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Finally done!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Magma Devourer, as a Silicon-based Lifeform, is truly full of treasures! But it&rsquo;s all thanks to the Warfare Ancient Tree; otherwise, it wouldn&rsquo;t be easy to make use of these treasures. Except for the Marrow Crystal, everything else needs the Warfare Ancient Tree&rsquo;s help to be utilized."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne looked at the Warfare Ancient Tree, feeling very happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hanging on the Warfare Ancient Tree were the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, Solar Battleship, Warfare Shield, Warfare Scythe, and Bloodwrought Bow, among other Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were all clearly growing stronger rapidly at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne murmured, "Now, I just need to wait for the zone duel to end!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he left the Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He found Leroy and Clara, tossing each of them a Dimensional Bag.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before they could speak, he said, "Each Dimensional Bag contains the corpses of one million Ice Beetles! Don't refuse me just yet. The Magma Devourer is a Silicon-based Lifeform, and every part of its body is a treasure, highly valuable! However, it's useful to me, so I can't share it with you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Therefore, I&rsquo;m compensating each of you with one million Ice Beetles. I hope you won&rsquo;t find it too little."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy and Clara both pressed their lips tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They didn&rsquo;t want compensation because they hadn&rsquo;t contributed at all to taking down the Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this time, Osborne's attitude was firm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is what you deserve! If you&rsquo;re unwilling to take it, then let&rsquo;s part ways. We won&rsquo;t act together anymore!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, Leroy and Clara fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, they put away the Dimensional Bag.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One million Ice Beetles could be exchanged for two billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, bringing their total earnings infinitely close to three billion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought this should be enough to ensure Clara and Leroy both surpass Brenda, pushing her out of the top three in the zone duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sat cross-legged and began to rest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, a mighty voice suddenly echoed in every corner of the Abyssal Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"All participants, listen up!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Zone duel ends early! All participants, gather at the Cosmic Translocator immediately!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
