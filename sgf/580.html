  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew gave a faint smile. "Why would you say that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Simply because Vincent, Owen, and Emma think you're no threat, while I see you as a major one. That's why I took action against you early.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that reason enough for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Matthew in surprise, deeply eyeing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew's frankness somehow made Osborne dislike him a little less.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I were Matthew, I would do the same," he thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, using tactics against a rival was completely normal. It would be foolish to just watch a competitor grow stronger and eventually become a threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such people weren't suited to be the head of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of place is the dungeon? Why does everyone in the Augustine family fear it so much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew laughed. "It seems you've accepted that I targeted you. That's good. Flexibility and resilience are true skills, and now I'm even more wary of you! If I don't completely break you now, you might become my biggest rival in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes, ignoring him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew then continued lightly, "Do you know what solitary confinement is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Of course."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Solitary confinement was a disciplinary measure within the military for errant soldiers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many soldiers were terrified of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Firstly, the conditions in solitary were harsh, often only 32 to 43 square feet, so cramped one couldn't stand upright or lie down flat, severely restricting movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the intense feelings of hunger and profound loneliness were what made solitary confinement most dreadful. For humans, who were social animals, it was a severe mental torment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many have even suffered mental breakdowns because of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew smiled faintly. "The Augustine family's dungeon is essentially a large solitary confinement cell! But don't think it's any less terrifying because it's bigger. In fact, our family's dungeon is even more horrifying than any solitary cell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because it's a world of decay and silence! There, there is nothing but continuous psychological assaults!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A world of decay and silence?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing but continuous psychological assaults?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That does sound quite terrifying."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew smiled faintly. "Once you experience it yourself, you'll understand. I hope you can withstand it. Just don't go mad. If that happens, the Augustine family would lose a talent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're worried I can't handle it? Then why punish me for a whole month?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew shrugged, "Just want to test if you have any other tricks up your sleeve!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can manage to get out early, you obviously have means. But if you're stuck there for a month, it means you're out of options. Even if you go mad, I won't be too upset."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted coldly. "You really do think of everything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No choice. The Augustine family is a huge family. If I want to be the first heir and eventually lead the main family, I have to think ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew sighed. "Despite being Rosmandi's oldest family, the pressure on us is immense. Other nations and ancient families match or even exceed the Augustine family in strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I become the head of the Augustine family, I will make it the most powerful family in the world!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Matthew's eyes sparkled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was surprised, having not expected Matthew to harbor such aspirations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly felt that Matthew might indeed be the right person to lead the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had the strength, vision, tactics, and aspirations!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Setting aside their rivalry, Osborne had to admit he respected Matthew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, they were destined to be rivals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had to become the first heir of the Augustine family and had to defeat Matthew and all the young members of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, your ambitions are commendable," Osborne finally said, "but I must tell you, you won't become the first heir of the Augustine family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew asked in surprise, "Who do you think could become the first heir of the Augustine family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, pointing at himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew looked even more surprised and then laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not bad, you're as confident as I am. I was right to target you regardless of everything. It's definitely the right move!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a pity you're too weak now. Otherwise, I'd really like to see you as my biggest threat and use more tactics against you. It would be so interesting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait until I get out. I'll get my revenge! Whatever you do to me, I'll do right back at you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I look forward to it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew said with a smile, "A strong opponent makes me stronger, and only the strongest can lead the Augustine family to greater glory!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be waiting for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Matthew and Osborne high-fived as if making a pact, a sense of mutual respect in their expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go. We've reached the dungeon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First, experience the horrors of the dungeon! If you can't withstand the dungeon, you're not fit to be my rival."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, they reached a dark doorway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Behind the door, Osborne sensed a dreadful presence.</span></p><div class="pagination">
