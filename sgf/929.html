  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Everett and Rumen, two top-tier Class S powerhouses, uniting to lay siege to the Augustine family, Osborne found himself in a tight spot. Their combined strength was far beyond anything he could handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given his current abilities, venturing outside the Augustine family's territory would be nothing short of reckless; danger lurked at every turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His only hope now rested on the shoulders of the God of Star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This once-mighty deity, though now reduced to a fractured divine soul, had proven capable of injuring Rumen and scaring both him and Everett off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it hadn't been for that intervention, Osborne would likely be dead, and the Augustine family would be facing annihilation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determined, Osborne made his way to the dungeons, keeping the existence of the God of Star a secret from Wesson and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, he stood before the ethereal being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star said, a smile gracing his features, "You've come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I take it you're here to ask for my help. Unfortunately, I can't do much for you. Right now, my power is less than one ten-thousandth of what it once was. The best I can do is scare them off, but actual combat? That's out of the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I tried to forcefully act against them, I could completely dissipate. Even if you do get rid of them, the League of Divine Descent and the Eityreia Organization would likely send in stronger reinforcements. That could make things even graver for the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To truly resolve your family's troubles, you'll have to rely on yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a lump in his throat, momentarily silenced by the God of Star's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Even he can't help me at all?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Biting his lip, Osborne asked, "How am I supposed to solve this? My strength is way too inadequate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star chuckled. "That's why you need to strengthen yourself! Sure, you may not be their match right now, but once you break through to Class S, they'll think twice before coming after you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When the time comes, even if you can't take them down, you'll be able to cause them plenty of trouble. Teaming up with the others from the Augustine family, there's a good chance you can drive them back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes sparkled with intrigue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, that hope dimmed almost instantly as a grim reality set in. "But breaking through to Class S isn't exactly a walk in the park. I just recently moved up to Class AAA! Even with all the talent in the world, there's no way I can quickly make that jump."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star smiled gently, "Well, it may not be as tough for you after all. For most, transitioning from being an ordinary human to becoming a Class S Lesser God is a monumental hurdle; even the most gifted individuals can stumble there. But for you, my friend? It might just come naturally."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's shock was palpable. He thought, "Breaking through to Class S will be easy for me? How have I never known that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star said, "Don't forget about your Fatebearer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fatebearer? Are you talking about Clarissa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart raced as a recollection sparked. Isa had told him that once he reached Class AAA, he could tap into the enormous fate power residing within Clarissa. By harnessing that energy, Osborne could undergo a significant transformation, possibly even breaking through to Class S directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne was filled with exhilaration. "How could I have forgotten about the fate power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to rush off to find Clarissa when an unfortunate thought struck him. She was still only Class AA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa had also mentioned that the fate power was crucial for Clarissa. Until she broke through to Class AAA, it was best not to let her lose access to that power, as it could significantly impact her future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow, deep in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "If I want to harness Clarissa's fate power to break through to Class S, I'll have to wait until she reaches Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how long will that take?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family is in a crisis, and I can't afford to wait that long!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the God of Star spoke up again, a smile on his face. "Osborne, bring the Fatebearer to me. In no more than seven days, I can help her break through to Class AAA. Once that happens, you'll be able to use her fate power to reach Class S."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart soared at the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, a flicker of doubt crossed his mind as he looked at the God of Star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait a minute, God of Star. How do you know all this? I never mentioned that I needed Clarissa to break through to AAA first before I could tap into her fate power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star hesitated for a moment, a hint of embarrassment flashing across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to tell Osborne that it was all advice from "Ms. Night," but he held his tongue, opting for a safer route.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, you see, I'm a god&mdash;I know everything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then," Osborne said, not wanting to dwell on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His excitement bubbled over. "I'm going to get Clarissa right now!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
