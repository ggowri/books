  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin walked towards his luxury car with a disdainful swagger, never looking back at the chaos he left behind. A real man never second-guessed his actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was confident that Osborne had been turned into a sieve by his subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had brought out such a large force just to deal with two people. It was a sheer waste of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to his surprise, a cacophony of screams erupted suddenly. These screams came from different people, indicating they couldn't be from Osborne and Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That could only mean... his own men!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin quickly turned to see what was happening, and to his horror, he saw his subordinates falling one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood in the distance, as calm as ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bullets rained down on him, only to stop abruptly in mid-air and then dart back faster, finding their mark in the bodies of Kevin's men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, hundreds of his subordinates were down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The survivors were now in a panic, all seeking cover behind trees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even so, the bullets flying back seemed to curve, piercing one by one those who hid behind cover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shrill and desperate screams echoed through the small forest. The hundreds of men Kevin brought were all shot down in a short time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin stood </span><span>alone,</span><span> his eyes wide with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew he was still standing not because he was formidable but because Osborne had chosen to spare him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Metahuman! You're a metahuman!" Kevin shouted in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was also a metahuman, but his power was far from as terrifying as Osborne's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled mockingly, "Do you still think it's a waste of time now? Your men seem quite useless. I haven't even exerted myself, and they're all down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he casually plucked a bullet suspended in front of him from mid-air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding the bullet, he stared at Kevin's forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, Kevin felt the breath of death and trembled violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, you can't kill me! Do you know who I am? I am from a branch of the top aristocratic Pluto family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The real background of our Hummingbird Gang is the Pluto family. We serve the Pluto family!" Kevin shouted in desperation, "Since you are a metahuman, you must know the Pluto family, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's smile widened. He had spared Kevin to learn the truth about the Hummingbird Gang's affiliations. Now that he had his answer, he immediately chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The top aristocratic Pluto family? The Hummingbird Gang has such formidable backing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin, thinking Osborne was intimidated, regained some of his composure and said with some pride, "In fact, the Hummingbird Gang's connections are even more powerful than you think. Otherwise, how could we act so boldly in </span><span>Pinchide</span><span> City?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so?" Osborne raised an eyebrow. "How do I know if what you're saying is true? Call the head of the Pluto family and have him come to redeem you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin hesitated for a moment before nodding and making the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay! I'll call him now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he hung up the phone and said calmly, "He says to wait. He'll be here soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gestured for Kevin to approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's not wait idly. Tell me all the evil deeds the Hummingbird Gang has done. Be thorough, or your fate will be dire."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin's face darkened. "I'm from the Pluto family..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Osborne pulled the trigger. The bullet struck Kevin's thigh, causing him to scream in agony and collapse to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never expected that even after invoking the might of the Pluto family, Osborne would still dare to shoot him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm giving you five seconds! Speak up or face my bullets," Osborne said coldly, counting down. "Five! Four! Three!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin's face twisted with indecision and dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before Osborne could finish counting, he fired again, hitting Kevin's other leg and eliciting an even more piercing scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you shoot when you only counted to three?" Kevin demanded, furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged. "I felt like it. Got a problem with that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With another shot, he hit Kevin's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will you talk?" Osborne asked again coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin, gritting his teeth against the pain, looked at Osborne with terror as if gazing upon a demon. He knew that if he didn't speak up soon, more bullet wounds would be added to his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll talk! I'll tell you everything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Kevin gave in, spilling all the atrocities committed by the Hummingbird Gang. As he spoke, Osborne's expression grew increasingly grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hummingbird Gang's crimes were even more heinous than he had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drug trafficking and smuggling were just the tip of the iceberg. Worse still were human trafficking, slave control, forcing women into prostitution, and even the trafficking of human organs...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These horrors occurred daily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You people deserve to die!" Osborne's voice was as cold as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he was aware of the world's dark underbelly, the extent of this cruelty still surpassed his expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To the Hummingbird Gang, ordinary people were not human beings but slaves, tools for making money, and even incubators for their organs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were nothing less than demons!</span></p><div class="pagination">
