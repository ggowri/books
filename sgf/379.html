  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's sudden appearance surprised everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd murmured, "Alexander is here, too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was said that he has become a Class A Power Master. When he broke through, bolts of lightning descended and even destroyed half of the Paltrow family's mountain!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard that his explosive power is extremely terrifying, and he is in seclusion to consolidate his power. Once his power is stabilized, his strength will far exceed that of an ordinary Class A Power Master!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He actually came here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at Alexander. Alexander was not tall and strong but rather somewhat feminine, like a scholar, but no one dared to look down upon him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was only 28 years old, but he was already the youngest Class A Power Master in Dampston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strength had surpassed 99% of the older generation of masters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lightning symbol on Alexander's forehead represented his extraordinary power. Some people said that he was the reincarnation of the God of Thunder, while others said that he was the Son of Thunder, carrying the power of the God of Thunder, so when he broke through, the lightning symbol appeared on his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at him with serious expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander was calm. He walked out of the crowd and looked at Osborne, who was standing behind Isaac.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was also looking at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Alexander showed up, Osborne had already noticed him. There was faint lightning fluctuation on Alexander, and it was unstable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a moment, Osborne knew that the young man was Alexander, who had just become a Class A Power Master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander did not show up, and Osborne just looked at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He activated the Satan's Eye and carefully observed Alexander. He could feel the terrifying energy in Alexander's body, which definitely exceeded Isaac's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not stable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even so, it was terrifying enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac had been a Class A Power Master for more than forty years. Alexander had just made a breakthrough, but his strength had already surpassed Isaac's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "Is this genius?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was solemn, and his judgment of Alexander's strength became clearer than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade and some people of the Paltrow family had been ready to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's plan had been completed. He killed Brad, Yohan, and Lauren, weakened the Paltrow family's strength, and puzzled its judgment in figuring out who killed them. Then, the Paltrow family had no way of attacking the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything was going as smoothly as Osborne had planned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Alexander suddenly appeared and revealed his identity, which surprised Osborne. When he saw Alexander looking at him, he suddenly had a bad premonition, and his face turned solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was not afraid, staring at Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled, "You are Osborne Augustine, the new heir of the Augustine family, right? I heard that you are also Clarissa's ex-boyfriend. Is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone around him couldn't help but fall silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People from the Walker, Marion, and even Paltrow families all looked at Osborne in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had heard of Osborne, but none of them had seen him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they didn't know that Osborne was Clarissa's ex-boyfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in Dampston knew that Alexander would marry Clarissa, the Fatebearer of the Radcliffe family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their wedding would be held after Alexander stabilized his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was Alexander's fianc&eacute;e.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprisingly, Osborne was Clarissa's ex-boyfriend!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the crowd saw Alexander staring at Osborne coldly, they suddenly became excited, thinking that something interesting was going to happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said coldly, "You seem to have misunderstood something. I'm not Clarissa's ex-boyfriend!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, the crowd was disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought Osborne gave in and dared not admit it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was not surprising. Alexander was a Class A Power Master, and Clarissa was his fianc&eacute;e. It was expected that Osborne would not admit that he was Clarissa's ex-boyfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not shameful to admit defeat to Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the people from the Augustine family couldn't help feeling disappointed when they heard Osborne's denial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered with a contemptuous look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Osborne continued, "I'm not Clarissa's ex-boyfriend. We have never broken up, and I'm her current boyfriend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surroundings fell into a dead silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the Augustine family instantly became excited, and then they worried about Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They saw Alexander's cold face and began to worry about Osborne's safety. Isaac stood in front of Osborne in a protective posture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's face was ice-cold, and the unstable power around him began to fluctuate even more violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the void, tiny streaks of lightning appeared and swam rapidly on Alexander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers were scared, and they stepped back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander stared at Osborne, who had a calm face, and said in a cold voice, "You are so bold! Don't you know that Clarissa is going to marry me? I asked Yohan and Lauren to warn you to stay away from Clarissa. It seems that you didn't take it seriously."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help laughing when he heard that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, his face turned serious, and he said disdainfully, "Why should I listen to you? Who do you think you are, asshole?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
