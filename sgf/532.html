  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Arrogant!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Impudent!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Both Henry and John snapped at Osborne, their anger palpable as they glared at him, feeling thoroughly insulted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, you're incredibly arrogant! According to our records, you're only twenty-five and have just reached Class A, right? You think you're worth us teaming up against?" Henry's voice was dripping with scorn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We don't want to bully you. Just pick your opponent and don't waste our time," John added sharply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne shrugged nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, if that's how it is, then let's get this started with you first. It won't take much time anyway," Osborne said, pointing at John.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A smug smile spread across John's face. He turned to Henry and said, "Henry, looks like you're out of luck. I'll teach him a lesson he won't forget, beat him half to death, and get some payback for Evelynn."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Henry snorted, saying, "What a load of luck."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Henry stepped back to the spectator stands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On Arena Number Nine, only Osborne and John remained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">John's face was twisted into a contemptuous smile. "Osborne, I'm nearly ten years older than you. I didn't want to pick on you, but your arrogance is something else. You even dared to mess with Evelynn from the main bloodline. I guess I'll have to use my advantage and put you in your place."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne remained calm. "Can we skip the small talk and get on with it? I'd rather not waste any more time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">John huffed, "If you want to get beaten so eagerly, I'm more than happy to oblige!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, a bright light flared from John's left eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Five white star-like points appeared, marking his Satan's Eye at level five.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne observed calmly, saying, "Level five Satan's Eye, impressive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, how much elemental essence have you absorbed? What level is your Devil's Light?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">John sneered, saying, "Since you're asking, I might as well tell you so you don't think you're unprepared after losing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've absorbed three types of elemental essence&mdash;wind, water, and fire! My Devil's Light is level two!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">John's expression was one of smug satisfaction as if he were flaunting his power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was taken aback, thinking to himself, "What's there to brag about?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just three types of essence and a level two Devil's Light?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If I told John that I've absorbed seven types and have a level six Devil's Light, he'd probably freak out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Osborne kept this to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't even want to use his Satan's Eye against John.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Calmly, he said, "Not bad. Now, you can make your move. Oh, and I should mention, I'm a martial artist, so my punches pack a real punch. Be careful."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">John scoffed, saying, "Is that all you've got? Pathetic! You have no idea how powerful a level two Devil's Light is! But then again, I've heard that the Augustine family from Dampston can't even activate Satan's Eye anymore, so your ignorance is understandable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now, brace yourself!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">John's body was enveloped in a burst of orange light, signifying his level two Devil's Light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So what if you're a martial artist? So what if you're strong? You won't even get close to me&mdash;I'll defeat you with ease!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, John made his move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His level two Devil's Light shot out, rapidly forming a gigantic fist that smashed toward Osborne's chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne felt the surge of energy from John's attack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne thought to himself, recognizing John's power, "Impressive strength! No wonder he's bold enough to stand up for Evelynn and take me on. Seems he's already Class A+ and probably not far from Class AA. Still, that won't be enough!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a heartbeat, Osborne's martial art aura flared, effortlessly countering John's Devil's Light attack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Devil's Light was extinguished against the brilliance of Osborne's martial art aura, causing only a minor ripple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">John was stunned by the sight, his eyes wide with shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Osborne wasn't about to give John time to recover. He propelled himself forward, his legs pushing off the ground. Like a released arrow, he sped towards John.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Watch out," Osborne said with a faint smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, he charged in with Spiral Force, his fist flowing towards John's chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">John's face hardened in a split second, but he didn't panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His Satan's Eye flared, projecting an illusion directly into Osborne's mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're done for!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">John sneered, confident that the illusion would disorient Osborne and leave him vulnerable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But as John prepared to press his advantage, he realized with horror that Osborne seemed completely unaffected. The fist in John's vision grew rapidly larger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the next instant, John was sent hurtling backward, blood spewing from his mouth as he flew over one hundred yards, crashing heavily into the rocks at the edge of Arena Number Nine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A dull thud echoed as John slammed into the rock wall. The solid rock remained unmoved while John's body slowly slid down, eventually coming to a stop with his head lolling to one side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was out cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne looked on with a calm smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that it? I haven't even exerted myself, and you're already down? How boring."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He then turned his gaze to Henry in the stands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne called out, waving at Henry with a smirk, "Your turn now! I hope you're a bit tougher than him&mdash;don't disappoint me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Henry's face darkened instantly, his expression a storm of rage and apprehension.</p><div class="pagination">
