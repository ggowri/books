  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Realm intertwined with space and time? Something you can't touch?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo was taken aback, genuinely perplexed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he was a top-tier Class S warrior, there were hardly any peers at his level who could even grasp a Level Four Realm. He himself was still stuck at the peak of Level Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The concept of a Level Five Realm was entirely foreign to him, and no one had ever bothered to explain it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! You can't touch it, at least not with our current level of strength. We're trapped in his Realm, and the only way out is if he disperses it himself or runs out of power to maintain it. Otherwise, we're stuck here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, if we can't even touch his Realm, how could we possibly shatter it? Only a deity, someone whose power can pierce through space and time, could break a Level Five Realm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter how many of us join forces, we'll never be able to break this Level Five Realm. It would just be a colossal waste of energy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Armstrong finished speaking, Gerardo's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He watched the Augustine family members flee in haste, his fists clenched in anger. Among the escaping crowd, he could sense Sebastian's presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian was clearly unconscious, hidden away in a box, being carried off by several elders of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Gerardo fumed, his rage boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armstrong said, a calm smile on his face, "Gerardo, no need to rush!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've already won! If the Augustine family wants to escape, let them. It just means we'll have to spend a little more time and effort tracking them down and finishing them off!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The underground world of Rosmandi now belongs to you! The major powers within Rosmandi have either bowed to you or been wiped out. What's left are just these stragglers&mdash;kicked dogs, if you will. If you kill them all, it might even be a bit dull! Why not let them live for now? Let them escape, and later, you can toy with them like a cat playing with a mouse. Doesn't that sound more entertaining?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Armstrong's words, Gerardo let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>True, the Augustine family was in disarray and fleeing, which meant he had technically won this battle. But until he personally eliminated Sebastian, he felt an unsettling itch in his gut that he couldn't shake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then there was Osborne, who still hadn't shown up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mere thought of Osborne darkened Gerardo's mood even further. Osborne was a little monster, and after his transformation in the Human Slave incubator, he had become even more terrifying. Just thinking about him made Gerardo uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed to wipe out the entire Augustine family, and fast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then could he find some peace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo scoffed, saying, "Armstrong, you seem to know a lot about Level Five Realm. I'm curious how long do you think this one will last?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armstrong smiled, "Don't worry, it won't be long!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That 'remnant god' over there has very little power left. If he had the strength to take us out, he would have done it already. Since he can't finish us off, he can only maintain this Level Five Realm for a limited time...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One hour!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One hour?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo frowned, contemplating the implications, "An hour is plenty of time for the Augustine family to make a clean getaway. But escaping my grasp? That's just wishful thinking!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's a shame I can't contact the outside world from within this Level Five Realm. I could have commanded the thousand Class S clones I have on standby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their help, not a single one of the Augustine family would escape!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for now, all I can do is wait&mdash;wait for this Level Five Realm to fade."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep within the dungeons of the Augustine Estate, the God of Star's essence was in turmoil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His remaining soul flickered like a dying ember, and his power had yet to recover. After being injured by the revived Dark Deity, he had grown even weaker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the most critical blow had come from Isa, who had taken his light elemental essence and given it to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, maintaining the Level Five Realm that trapped Gerardo and his companions was the limit of his capabilities. Any thought of launching an attack against them was simply out of the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sighed heavily, "Once upon a time, I was a true god. And now, I can't even handle a few Lesser Gods. What a sad state of affairs!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you need to hurry back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All I can do is buy your friends and family here for an hour. After that, I'll be out of power. If you're not back by then, they won't stand a chance against the hunters on their trail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And I won't be able to help anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As God of Star spoke, his gaze shifted to a figure not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa remained unconscious, but the energy surrounding her was shifting. Massive Divine and Demonic Wings unfurled, enveloping her like a cocoon, and a terrifying power brewed within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star's eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So that's it! After breaking through to Class AAA, she hasn't awakened because she's undergoing a transformation. She's on the verge of advancing to Class S!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
