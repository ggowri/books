  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't win!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yaron looked extremely embarrassed and reluctant, and he had already retreated from Osborne as much as he could, and so did others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a gloomy expression, Shawn gritted his teeth and said, "Either he or we will die today! And after we die, all forces in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> must submit to him in order to survive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People from other families were startled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yaron clenched his teeth and said, "When will the support from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> arrive? If they don't show up soon, we will all be slaughtered by Osborne." He finally stopped beating about the bush and asked directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn looked grim and shook his head. "I don't know! But according to the agreed time, they should have arrived!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Yaron cursed angrily and quickly dodged to the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne did not stop because he knew the four ancient families had gained the help of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> before they struck him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never dared to underestimate the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next thing he needed to do was to kill or disable those people so that he could deal with the real battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing his punch, Shawn and the others fled frantically and had no guts to take this overwhelming power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered. "Clarissa, protect yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa nodded and spread out her huge wings without hesitation, holding the Fate Staff to defend the incoming impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, Osborne finally took action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He left the yacht for the first time during this period, casually tearing apart the space. Then, he appeared behind a Class A martial master from the Walker family three hundred feet away through Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the space fluctuation behind, that man was startled, but it was too late to dodge Osborne's attack since he could exert the extra energy so fast. Osborne had already punched his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's body exploded directly in the air, and his flesh and blood scattered on the sea, attracting countless fish that were not afraid of wind and tides to eat his dead </span><span>body ferociously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne did not stop and walked into the dimensional rift again. The next second, he appeared from behind a master of the Luther family and knocked him to pieces with a punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn warned the rest of his coordinators, "We can't disperse! He has spatial power and can travel through dimensions! Everyone </span><span>gather</span><span> together and use your power to defend yourselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn shouted and gave orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next second, he couldn't keep being a calm commander. He felt the fluctuation of space behind him, but Osborne in the distance had already disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Osborne had stood behind him. Clenching his teeth, Shawn didn't attack but used all his power to defend his back and rushed forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, a terrifying force hit his back, and he immediately vomited blood. Fortunately, Shawn defended in time and rushed to dissipate part of the force, making him survive from being punched apart like others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even though he escaped for now, he did not relax at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before his body stopped rushing forward, he suddenly felt a spatial fluctuation in front of him. A dimensional rift formed almost instantly, and Osborne walked out of it and blocked his way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wore a disdainful sneer and looked at him with satire. "Nice try, but you still have to die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne punched him in the chest. Shawn tried desperately to dodge but failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!!" Shawn screamed madly and felt death was approaching him. A terrifying force seemed to emerge from his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was Shawn's soul of powers!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His soul of powers sensed that Shawn was facing a life-and-death crisis, so it took the initiative to embody itself and protect its master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Osborne moved too fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Shawn's soul of powers could shape itself, Osborne punched him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And his body exploded in a blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A </span><span>top Class</span><span> A Power Master, who could soon get the breakthrough of Class A+, was beaten to death by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yaron, who had run far away, saw Shawn's end and gasped in fear. He and others no longer cared about saving Wallace and fled as much as he could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't win!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was invulnerable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn was already the strongest among them, but he was still easily killed by Osborne. If the fight continued, they would definitely be wiped out here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think you can get away?" Osborne sneered and suddenly opened Satan's Eye, fixing his eyes on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, all of them felt a heavy pressure, like a mountain pressing down on them. They seemed to be stuck in a swarm and couldn't keep running away anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne used mind control to restrain them from escaping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't even think about it. Just die here!" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered and started slaughtering. The people from four ancient families were all in collusion with the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The final requirement of Osborne's fifth test of succession was to kill them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as he could complete the task, his fifth test would be almost complete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne flashed behind Yaron and punched the panicked Yaron into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With another crushing sound, he killed Emery in the same way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a massacre.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, all his enemies became minced fresh.</span></p><div class="pagination">
