  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne could easily see the flaws in the so-called "evidence." After nearly a century of living, how could Wesson not see through it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His anger flared as he confronted Rumen. "How shameless can you be, Rumen?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those wearing the Augustine family attire aren't even from our family&mdash;they're just your hired goons, aren't they? You're after the rare metal mines of the Draco Group, and now you're staging this charade to find a chance to strike at us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elders of the Augustine family echoed Wesson's outrage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shameless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen merely scoffed, saying, "You call it a charade? The people who took my daughter were wearing your family's attire. They are your people!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't hand over my daughter, don't blame me when things get ugly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a surge of power erupted from him, sending shockwaves through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson's expression hardened, but he stood his ground. "Rumen, I won't deny your strength&mdash;you're a top-tier Class S powerhouse! If you go all out, none of us in the Augustine family can stand against you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if you think that'll make us beg for mercy, you're sorely mistaken! If you want a fight, then we'll give you one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sudden clap of his hands, Wesson summoned eight figures from the buildings behind him. Eight women emerged, each radiating an aura of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened as he recognized one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hernandez!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His grandfather's maid, Serena, looked even more formidable than before, her strength seemingly renewed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled at Osborne, her confidence palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, it's great to see you again. Your growth is astonishing; in just a few months, you've reached this level of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now's not the time for catching up, though. We'll chat once we've dealt with these intruders."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena's gaze turned icy as she focused on Rumen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced at the other seven women beside Serena, sensing their immense power&mdash;some even stronger than Serena herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three of them were undoubtedly Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thrill of excitement coursed through him, but Rumen's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've heard that Sebastian took in eight maids, each with exceptional talent and strength. So, you must be them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't expect you to be this powerful! Three Class S? Six top-tier Class AAA? Impressive, but do you really think you can stop me? That's downright laughable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you refuse to hand over my daughter, then let's fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen's gaze turned steely as he looked at Wesson and the three Class S women. "Everett, I'll take care of these four Class S fighters. You handle the rest of the women and the Augustine family elders. Sound good?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett smirked. "Just a bunch of Class AAA trash. I can handle them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perfect, then let's get to it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Rumen launched himself into action, unleashing four beams of light aimed at Wesson and the three Class S women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces shifted to shock as they quickly braced themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All four were pushed back a step, their expressions grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen laughed coldly. "Let's take this fight to the skies so we don't turn the Augustine Estate into rubble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he shot upward like a rocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson exchanged glances with the three Class S women, all of them nodding resolutely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather, stay alert!" Wesson called back to Osborne before he and the three women shot into the sky after Rumen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were going to attack Rumen, but Osborne's heart sank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their numbers, he wasn't optimistic about their chances. Rumen's power was overwhelming, and four against one might not be enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wanted to assist Wesson, pulling on the Thundergod Gloves and gripping the Volt Hammer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, three figures stepped into his path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were Scarlett, Bradley, and Marlon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rage burned in their eyes, which were filled with hatred and murderous intent. Enclosing Osborne, they declared, "Osborne, your opponents are us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"On the arena, you defeated us, shamed us, now it's our turn for revenge! We'll defeat you, kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they spoke, their hands clenched mighty divine artifacts, and a surge of power enveloped them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted, saying, "You? Looking to take revenge on me? I won against you on the arena, and I'll win again here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting a moment, Osborne lunged forward, intent on swiftly dispatching the trio before moving to support Wesson and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Volt Hammer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a mighty swing of the Volt Hammer, bolts of lightning crackled and crashed toward Bradley, who stood in his path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlett, Bradley, and Marlon were at the pinnacle of the younger generation, but among them, Bradley was the weakest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne aimed to take him down first to create an opening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His plan was sound, but the trio wasn't about to give him the chance. In an instant, three powerful Realms enveloped him, trapping him in a cage of power.</span></p><div class="pagination">
