  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour slipped by in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star had reached his limit; his body was becoming almost transparent, as if he were on the verge of vanishing from existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a heavy heart, he knew he had to retract the Level Five Light Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From here on out, it's all up to you. I can't help you anymore. Whether you survive or not is in your hands now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the God of Star sank down into a meditative pose, and the Level Five Light Realm dissipated in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo, witnessing this, couldn't help but let out a cold chuckle. He ordered, "After them! Find them and wipe them out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't rush in himself; instead, he unleashed his power, sending it probing toward Challenge Peak and Mount Celestial Reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excitement flickered in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "A god in a weakened state... If I could capture him, I wonder if I could turn him into my Human Slave. It's worth a shot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family is definitely hiding something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few centuries ago, they were just another ordinary superpower. But ever since they moved here, their strength has skyrocketed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then there's the Godfather's scepter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its power is unmatched! It's even more potent than a top-grade divine artifact&mdash;probably on par with a supreme divine artifact!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But here's the catch: the Godfather's scepter only shows its true strength within the Augustine Estate. Outside of it, it's just an ordinary top-grade divine artifact!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This means the Augustine family must have a secret!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, let's dig a little deeper..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's power swept over Challenge Peak, but he found nothing. In the dungeon, there was a fortress, blocking any energy from seeping through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustrated, he reluctantly shifted his focus to Mount Celestial Reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he froze in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, there are still people here? That energy... it's strong. Class S level! Let me go check it out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo locked onto Anastasia's presence and sped toward Mount Celestial Reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Armstrong hadn't left either. He sent his men to hunt down the fleeing Augustine family and other factions while he remained behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw Gerardo rushing toward Mount Celestial Reach, he followed suit without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Sin, the moment the Level Five Light Realm vanished, he had already led a group of Eityreia Organization assassins using Stealth Art to pursue the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fueled by rage over Osborne's murder of his wife and daughter, he vowed to eliminate everyone connected to Osborne without a moment's pause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hunting was their specialty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that very moment, nearly two thousand miles away from Newport City, a desolate island in the middle of the ocean erupted with violent winds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gales whipped up the waves, sending them crashing outward in furious circles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire island trembled under the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying force suddenly erupted from the island, dark clouds rolling in overhead, flickering with lightning as if doomsday had arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thunderous sounds erupted from the island, rhythmic and pulsating, like the beat of a heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each rumble, a wave of sheer power surged forth from the ground, echoing the island's ominous energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the sound of Osborne's heartbeat! After four grueling days of relentless effort, Osborne finally shattered the elusive Class S barrier that had seemed just within reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the barrier crumbled, a powerful transformation began to unfold within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt himself ascending!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body and soul surged with energy, both in a state of upheaval and metamorphosis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An overwhelming sense of euphoria washed over him, flooding his senses with pure bliss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This transformation and elevation lasted for a full hour before it gradually subsided. The storm clouds that had gathered above the island dissipated, the lightning ceased its furious dance, and the island returned to its tranquil state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly snapped his eyes open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A brilliant light shot forth from his gaze. His left eye glowed with the eerie radiance of Satan's Eye, a soft blue hue illuminating the surroundings, while his right eye gleamed with the iconic glow of Medusa's Gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A piercing brilliance emanated from his right eye, striking the surface of the sea. In an instant, the water began to change, transforming into stone before his very eyes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sat frozen in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel it; he had ascended from Class AAA to Class S, experiencing monumental enhancements in every aspect of his being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne hadn't anticipated that after breaking through to Class S, his right eye would undergo such a bizarre transformation, granting him the power of Medusa&mdash;the ability to petrify anything in his sight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the unique power of Medusa!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be the result of Gerardo's cultivation serum? Did those concoctions contain the heart's blood of Goddess Medusa, triggering this mutation in me?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
