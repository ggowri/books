  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Empress Kira disappear, Primordial let out a sigh of relief. "I take back my earlier praise. Damn it! You actually pushed me to the edge."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial felt a bit helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Empress Kira had already disappeared. He could control his body to return to the center of Osborne's Soul Current Ocean. But after hesitating for a moment, he didn't dare to do so because he was afraid.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Empress Kira was too terrifying. If he forcibly moved his body to the center of Osborne's Soul Current Ocean, the next time Empress Kira woke up and discovered what he had done, she might kill him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hadn't grown up yet. But even if he devoured all the other World Tree offshoots and became the innate World Tree, he still might not be able to defeat Empress Kira.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial quickly figured it out and said, "Forget it, this woman is too terrifying. I won't argue with her. I'll just stay on the edge. It won't affect me too much. Anyway, as long as I can remain in Osborne's Soul Current Ocean, it's fine."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, Osborne gained a lot this time. Empress Kira used her power to heal his physical injuries. Not only did this prevent his body from being destroyed, but it also solidified his potential. In the future, his potential might be even greater."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Also, Empress Kira actually linked Osborne's Satan's Eye with his Soul Current Ocean. From now on, Satan's Eye can draw power from the Soul Current Ocean for energy replenishment and grow as the Soul Current Ocean improves, even controlling the vast soul power within it to launch Soul Attacks."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"His gains this time are immense."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial couldn't help but marvel at Osborne's incredible luck. In a situation where severe injury or even death was certain, he still managed to have Empress Kira save him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, not only was he fine, but he also gained immensely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was unaware of the outside situation. He only wanted to push Satan's Eye to its full potential to continue Time Retrace and see what had happened in the past.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment Empress Kira linked his Satan's Eye with his Soul Current Ocean, Osborne suddenly felt everything change. The world before his eyes seemed clearer, and performing Time Retrace became much easier for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His Satan's Eye leveled up!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn&rsquo;t bother figuring out why this happened. He just felt incredibly happy because a stronger Satan's Eye meant he could continue retracing time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could now surpass the thousand-year mark and continue retracing time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Continue!" Osborne activated the power of Satan's Eye. Instantly, the scenes before him flickered again, and he saw images from even further back in time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>1010!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>1020!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>1050!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, the scene Osborne saw changed. He spotted a figure near Michelle's tomb.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when Osborne saw clearly what those people were doing, his eyes instantly turned blood-red, and a terrifying killing intent erupted from him. "You deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne saw a group of people appear near Michelle's tomb, led by a noble and beautiful woman.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was too familiar with this woman because she was Callista, the queen of the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was Weston's biological mother and the instigator of Osborne and Michelle's tragic fate in their past life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the scene, Callista coldly led her people to Michelle's tomb. After staring at it for a long time, she suddenly waved her hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her lips moved slightly, but no sound came from the scene. However, Osborne could tell from her lip movements that she was saying, "Dig it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, several of Callista's guards stepped forward. They first dismantled the tomb's formation and then began digging up Michelle's tomb.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The scene made Osborne's body tremble violently. "It's her! So it was her!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clenched his teeth. He didn't even notice the blood dripping from the corner of his mouth, as anger and killing intent nearly consumed his sanity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "The one who leveled my mother's tomb is Callista. Why did she do that? What gives her the right to do that?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>My mother is already dead. She has been buried for fifty years. Why would Callista bring people to level her tomb? Why?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What grudge was there between them? Why, even fifty years after my mother's death, would Callista still refuse to let her go and come to level her tomb?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne's heart was filled with killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the scene, Callista's guards dug up Michelle's tomb. Then, they unearthed a coffin and directly carried it out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Callista personally smashed the coffin lid.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne closed his eyes, tears streaming down his face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "My mother has been dead for fifty years. But Callista dug up her tomb and even smashed the lid of her coffin."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hatred felt tangible, causing Osborne's power to surge uncontrollably, as if on the verge of losing control.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could barely suppress the hatred and killing intent in his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Callista were right in front of him now, even knowing her immense strength and that he was far from being her match, he would still strike without hesitation to kill her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But unfortunately, Callista wasn't here. So, Osborne could only suppress the killing intent and hatred in his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He opened his eyes again and continued watching those scenes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne was stunned again because he suddenly realized that after Michelle's coffin was opened, there were no remains of Michelle inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The coffin was empty!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the footage, Callista was also shocked. Then, she angrily smashed the coffin into pieces, her eyes filled with killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Callista said something to the people around her, then turned and left directly, while the others quickly filled in the excavated tomb.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, the footage disappeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What&rsquo;s going on?" Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Callista and her people leveled my mother's tomb and dug up her coffin. But there were no remains of my mother in the coffin. Where are my mother's remains?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's face turned extremely grim. There was only one possible explanation for this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Callista came to level Michelle's tomb, someone had already dug it up and taken Michelle's remains.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who was it?" Osborne gritted his teeth. If he wanted to uncover the truth, he had to keep tracing back in time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this time, it was fifty years after Michelle's burial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He just needed to trace back another fifty years, and everything would become clear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne wasted no time and continued with Time Retrace. Time rewound year by year. However, Osborne didn't see anyone come to pay respects to Michelle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the scene he saw finally changed again. Osborne showed an expression of disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "How could this be? How could this be? No! This is absolutely impossible!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's face looked terrible. At this moment, he saw the scene of Michelle being buried after her execution 1,100 years ago.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the scene, he could clearly see Michelle's remains lying quietly in the coffin, then being buried in the tomb.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this is absolutely impossible!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "From the time my mother was buried in the tomb to fifty years later when Callista brought people to dig it up, no one had touched my mother's tomb, no one had paid respects to her, and no one had excavated her tomb. So, how did my mother's remains disappear?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne clenched his fists tightly, his expression utterly bewildered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "My mother's remains vanished inexplicably."</span></p><div class="pagination">
