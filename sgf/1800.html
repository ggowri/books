  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zoe's soul power attacks were always intertwined with melody.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before she unlocked her elemental powers, her singing could effortlessly ensnare anyone who heard it. The longer she sang, the more potent the effect became.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only those significantly stronger than her could hope to break free from her influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was why she often shattered her enemies' Soul Current Oceans with the power of her song.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this time, Zoe didn't sing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After channeling Osborne's immense soul power, she simply uttered a single syllable. Instantly, a horrific scream erupted from Caesar as he clutched his head and collapsed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With just that one sound, Zoe had already breached Caesar's Soul Current Ocean!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The agony of his torn Soul Current Ocean sent him into a frenzy of pain, his mind spiraling into chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sight left everyone around them utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The impressive results weren't just due to Osborne's powerful soul power; it was also a testament to Zoe's extraordinary method of attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, even with such formidable soul power, Osborne posed no real threat to Caesar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, under Zoe's control, that same soul power transformed into a lethal weapon, rendering the late-stage Deity King completely defenseless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Wasting no time, Zoe unleashed another soul power attack, fearing that Caesar might still have some fight left in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He screamed again, blood streaming from his ears, eyes, and nose, confusion clouding his gaze as he twitched on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Done! It's over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt Zoe's soul power retreating from his Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But then, he noticed Zoe sway slightly, nearly losing her balance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He rushed to steady her; concern etched on his face. "Zoe, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zoe smiled and shook her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm fine, Osborne! It's just that your soul power is so overwhelming that controlling it took everything I had. I'm a bit drained, but I just need a moment to recover."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing that, Osborne let out a sigh of relief. "I'm glad you're okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all turned their attention to the crumpled figure of Caesar, a mix of satisfaction and cold amusement on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had witnessed firsthand how strong Caesar was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had created eight Spatial Clones to surround him, launching a relentless assault, yet nothing had fazed Caesar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His formidable Supreme Sovereign's Armor had rendered him nearly invincible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Caesar's own strength was no joke either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As one of the Five Brilliant Scions of the Paramount Supreme Clan, he ranked among the top five young talents in the clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even without the armor, only Osborne had a real shot at defeating him; even Anastasia wouldn't have been confident in taking him on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And yet, such a powerful foe had been taken down so easily!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's strip him of that Supreme Sovereign's Armor! Zoe, from now on, it's yours to use! Your elemental power is soul-based, and you're most vulnerable when enemies get close after your soul power attacks fail. With that armor, you won't have to worry about getting hurt anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As for the rest of us, we'll figure it out later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone nodded in agreement. Zoe was indeed the one who needed the Supreme Sovereign's Armor the most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bryce hurried over to strip the armor off Caesar, handing it to Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, what do we do with this guy? He's still alive!" Bryce asked, glancing at Caesar's battered form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne replied coolly, "We kill him, of course!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's one of the Five Brilliant Scions of the Paramount Supreme Clan, so taking him out will ensure that our Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings become known throughout Celestara!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At his words, Bryce's excitement was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll take care of this! I've had it up to here with those arrogant Paramount Supreme Clan members. They're just like us, part of the Human Community, yet they act like they're above everyone else! What are they so proud of, anyway?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Bryce grabbed Caesar by the collar, lifting him off the ground with one hand while brandishing the Supreme Malevolence Sword in the other, ready to sever Caesar's head from his shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caesar, sensing the impending doom, suddenly snapped back to reality. But with his Soul Current Ocean shattered, he was in no position to fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Terror flooded his eyes as he looked at Bryce, feeling the murderous intent radiating from Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"W-what are you doing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm Caesar! One of the Five Brilliant Scions of the Paramount Supreme Clan! I'm a direct descendant of the esteemed Lord Malevolence! If you harm me, you're all dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No one will save you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bryce scoffed, a derisive smile spreading across his face. "Caesar, huh? Even now, you think you can threaten us? It doesn't matter if you're just Lord Malevolence's descendant or even his own son... Today, you're as good as dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he raised the Supreme Malevolence Sword high above his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Please! No! Don't kill me! I can give you Celestial Crystals! I can offer you Miracle Elixirs! Just let me go, and I'll give you anything!" Caesar began to plead desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bryce's laughter echoed, filled with delight as he looked down at the pitiful figure of Caesar begging for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, the mighty Paramount Supreme Clan can grovel, too! Too bad it's too late for that! Time to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a swift motion, Bryce swung the sword down, and Caesar's head flew high into the air, severed cleanly from his body.</span></p><div class="pagination">
