  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix was now certain he had attacked with all his might. He treated Osborne as an opponent on the same level as himself, but his attack seemed laughable in front of Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne easily neutralized his attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Impossible!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix gritted his teeth and said, "I am Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, and you are merely Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection. We are both super geniuses, how could I not be your match?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix launched another attack. Osborne calmly dodged again, then instantly appeared in front of Hendrix, looking at him with a cold sneer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix's expression changed drastically.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, Osborne had displayed incredibly powerful close combat skills, so Hendrix dared not let Osborne get close. As he hurled the Supreme Sacred Artifact in his hand at Osborne, he immediately prepared to flee.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But unfortunately, he was too slow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne reached out and grabbed his neck, then lifted Hendrix into the air.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hendrix, you disappoint me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered at Hendrix and said, "After over a thousand years, is this all the improvement in your cultivation level? With this level of strength, you still want to kill me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix looked at him in terror.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Osborne gripping his neck, he felt the breath of death. He burst out with strength, trying to struggle, but found that the terrifying power from Osborne's palm directly suppressed his efforts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His strength was no match at all!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix grew even more terrified, but with his neck being gripped, he couldn't even speak and could only look at Osborne with pleading eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "This is just the beginning, and you're already begging? But do you think begging will work? If begging worked, how would I have suffered such humiliation and torment from you over a thousand years ago in my past life? If begging worked, why would I come seeking revenge on you now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, his hand slowly tightened its grip.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix's eyes widened as he felt death approaching, his heart filled with fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne quickly let go.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He smiled and said, "You think I would kill you? Dream on! How could I let you die so easily? I said I would break your leg bones bit by bit, shatter every bone in your body, and then crush your skull..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Want to die? Not that easy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Osborne struck one of Hendrix's legs with his other hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A clear sound of bone breaking echoed. Hendrix's body trembled violently in pain, his face pale as paper, letting out painful whimpers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I remember, back then you broke my leg just like this! You were laughing so happily at that time. Did you ever think that one day, I would break your leg like this too?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered, "Hold on, this is just the beginning!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Osborne struck again, breaking Hendrix's other leg. But this was far from over. Osborne then proceeded to slowly break every single bone in Hendrix's body, from his limbs to his spine, and finally to his skull...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But even so, Hendrix still didn&rsquo;t die.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn&rsquo;t because, as an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, his vital essence was incredibly strong, but because Osborne was using the power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to heal him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Hendrix's bones were broken, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity immediately healed them, only for Osborne to break them again, repeating the cycle in an endless torment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes were blood-red.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, scenes of being humiliated and tormented by Hendrix in his past life flashed through his mind. He was determined to return that humiliation and torment a hundredfold to Hendrix!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How do you feel?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix's clothes were soaked with sweat. He was held mid-air by Osborne, his eyes filled with despair, as if completely broken.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Osborne said calmly, "Prince Hendrix, why aren't you speaking? Oh! I forgot, you can't talk right now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, he tossed Hendrix to the ground like throwing away trash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix struggled to lift his head and rasped, "Osborne, you bastard, if you have the guts, just kill me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered at the words, "Kill you? How could I! My revenge has just begun! Are you feeling utterly hopeless now? Back then, I was hopeless too, but no one spared me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How about you apologize to me first?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix's eyes were filled with pain. Seeing the mocking expression in Osborne's eyes, he angrily said, "Osborne, damn you! Don't think you can humiliate me! No matter how you torture me, I won't apologize to you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're just a bastard, a damn bastard! If I had the chance again, I would still humiliate and torture you mercilessly! My only regret is not killing you with my own hands back then, not crushing your soul to pieces!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I had known this day would come, I should have destroyed you completely, leaving you no chance for revenge!" Hendrix growled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne laughed and said, "Regret it? Too bad, it's already too late! Don't worry, I won't make the same mistake as you. I will completely kill you, crush your soul, and leave you no chance for revenge!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But before that, keep enduring my torment!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Osborne began breaking Hendrix's bones bit by bit from bottom to top, then used the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to heal his injuries.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix's eyes were filled with despair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that moment, he suddenly erupted. However, he didn't attack Osborne but instead lunged fiercely toward a severely injured astral projection in the distance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered coldly and did not stop him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That astral projection was instantly blasted to death by Hendrix.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Hendrix's aura began to rapidly expand and erupt. His cultivation level unexpectedly broke through from Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection to Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness in an instant!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling the immense power, Hendrix couldn't help but burst into laughter, then coldly stared at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, you deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You really deserve to die! How dare you torture me. But you didn't know, I was just a step away from breaking through to become Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, did you? Finally, I found the opportunity, and I finally broke through!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, I am already Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The humiliation you just gave me, now I will make you pay tenfold, a hundredfold!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get ready to die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix's eyes were filled with boiling rage. Having broken through to Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, his strength had skyrocketed, and so had his confidence. He was determined to torment Osborne brutally and take his revenge!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he wanted to see fear, regret, and panic on Osborne's face, but unfortunately, he saw nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression was calm. He smiled and said, "Congratulations on breaking through your cultivation level and becoming Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness! Also, congratulations on regaining your confidence... so I can make you despair once again!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne instantly launched an attack on her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix shouted angrily, "Get lost! I am now Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness. You're no longer my match! Now, it's my turn..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Hendrix could finish his words, his body was suddenly sent flying and crashed heavily to the ground. He was completely stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, he was enveloped by Osborne's power and had his throat grabbed again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness? Is it that powerful?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just keep feeling the despair!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne began breaking Hendrix's bones over and over, as if he would never stop.</span></p><div class="pagination">
