  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The owner of the whip was an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King. His cultivation level was the same as Osborne's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, his whip was caught in Osborne's hand. However, no matter how much strength he unleashed, he couldn't pull the whip back, as if it were welded to Osborne's palm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He panicked immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who are you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't answer. He just stared at the man with bloodshot eyes, as if he were about to devour him. In that instant, a terrifying killing intent engulfed him. Immediately, he felt terrified, and his body began to tremble violently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You, you..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne growled, "You deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That roar was like a beast's growl. His body was trembling violently. At this moment, he could no longer suppress his anger and yanked the whip fiercely. The man couldn't hold onto the whip and let go voluntarily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Osborne swung the whip fiercely, lashing it toward the man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In a panic, the man immediately tried to dodge but couldn't avoid it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The whip struck his head fiercely, causing it to burst open like a watermelon. His blood and brain matter splattered everywhere.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, this was not the end.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne's anger gave him immense strength. Then, he forcefully lashed the man's body, causing it to explode.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, a terrifying crack appeared on the ground, extending deep into the resource-bearing planet's interior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne's killing intent still hadn't diminished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stared at those dozen Frenetic Storm Warband members; they had been beating and torturing his parents&mdash;they were the culprits!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You all deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The whip was just an ordinary Apex divine artifact. Under Osborne's terrifying outburst of power, it shattered instantly with a loud bang. But before that, the bodies of those dozen Frenetic Storm Warband members had already been whipped to explosion by Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's terrifying power left them without even intact corpses, only the tiniest fragments of flesh and blood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire canyon was cracked open by the immense force.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the fifty-plus slaves looked on in terror as Osborne killed over a dozen Frenetic Storm Warband members with just two lashes, feeling utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he had no time to pay attention to them. He quickly rushed to Theodore and Vivienne, checking their injuries.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Good, you're not dead yet!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne trembled, frantically channeling the power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity into Theodore and Vivienne's bodies. Instantly, they began to recover rapidly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their horrific wounds healed rapidly, and the whip marks vanished quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the blink of an eye, their injuries were healed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Theodore and Vivienne felt they had recovered. They quickly exchanged a glance, their eyes filled with surprise and confusion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially seeing Osborne trembling all over with tears streaming down his face, they felt even more puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, Vivienne said, "Th-thank you for saving us!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's body trembled again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stared fixedly at Vivienne's face at this moment, feeling his heart ache sharply because her face was covered with dense scars, left from a long time ago. They appeared extremely hideous and ugly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had no idea how these scars came to be.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He only felt heartache for Vivienne because she was his mother.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching her cautiously thank him, he only felt as if his heart was being clenched.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Theodore shielded Vivienne behind him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's strange behavior made him a bit worried and terrified. He thought Osborne was going to hurt Vivienne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked, "Who, who are you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What do you want to do?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Theodore. This was his father, a weary-faced middle-aged man. Despite the fear in his weathered eyes, he still tightly shielded Vivienne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All these years, they have suffered!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and forced a smile. His voice trembled slightly as he replied, "You, you are Theodore Augustine and Vivienne Augustine, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted to make a final confirmation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Theodore and Vivienne exchanged a glance, utterly surprised that Osborne actually knew them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, they found Osborne's behavior too strange.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes were filled with tears, and his body was trembling violently, seemingly out of excitement rather than fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Theodore and Vivienne didn't feel any threat from Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She stepped forward and replied, "I am Vivienne Augustine. Do you, do you know us? What do you want from us? And why are you crying?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Seeing you cry, I don't know why, but I suddenly feel so sad."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vivienne suddenly started crying too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne started trembling even more. He could no longer control his emotions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He shouted, "Mom!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he shed more tears.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vivienne was completely stunned, standing there helplessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Theodore was stunned too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at Osborne in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne called Vivienne "Mom."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a long time, Vivienne finally came to her senses. She asked in a trembling voice, "W-what did you just call me? You called me Mom? I-I'm not your mother!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head. "No. You are my mother! I am your child, Osborne Augustine! You are my parents!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vivienne and Theodore were stunned again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They exchanged a glance, suddenly remembering something, then looked at Osborne in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You... you are our child?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The child from Blue Planet?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded vigorously, crying as he said, "Yes! I am the child you had on Blue Planet! Mom, Dad, I finally found you! I'm sorry, I came too late!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, he felt himself tightly embraced by Vivienne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she burst into loud sobs. Theodore also teared up instantly, holding Osborne and Vivienne in his arms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, they all felt the bond of blood between them, which made them even more emotional.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, you're alive!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're alive!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vivienne eagerly stroked Osborne's face, feeling overjoyed. "I thought you died over twenty years ago! You're alive! This is wonderful, you're alive!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a dozen figures suddenly descended into the canyon.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They are members of the Frenetic Storm Warband.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their aura was incredibly powerful. They were all Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?! Someone escaped from here!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among them, the leader coldly said, "You lowly slaves dare to escape? If you surrender obediently now, you can suffer a little less!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Otherwise, you will all die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vivienne and Theodore immediately stopped crying, their faces showing fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh no, it's Magnus Watts!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, leave here quickly! Magnus is an advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior! Now, he's the strongest in the Frenetic Storm Warband! Don't worry about us. Just go!" Vivienne shouted anxiously, shielding Osborne behind her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, she felt despair.</span></p><div class="pagination">
