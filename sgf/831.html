  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Who was Helios Thornberry?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was the unrivaled titan atop the Quasi-Divine Rankings, and his name was etched in gold by the Prophet Alliance.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was, without question, the mightiest warrior to walk the earth.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though classified as S-class, his prowess eclipses that of Marvin Williamson, surpassing even Sebastian and the King of the Aberrants.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aged over two centuries, Helios had not graced the world with his presence for many a year. Yet, his existence was an undeniable truth, and his legacy continued to ripple through the ages, sending shivers of reverence across the globe.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Thornberry family, hailing from Marcelin, was not just any divine family. They were the mightiest divine family on the earth.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the behest of the illustrious Thornberry family, the League of Divine Descent came into being. The Thornberry family, with its deep roots and venerable heritage, stood as one of the triumvirate of permanent members within this celestial coalition.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumen Thornberry, the formidable patriarch of the Thornberry family, not only led his storied family but also held the prestigious position among the five deputy leaders of the League of Divine Descent. His power was vast.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's visage was a mask of solemnity.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Beyond the formidable prowess of the Thornberry family, Osborne was well-acquainted with Marlon, a figure whose affections had turned towards Clarissa. Osborne had noted Marlon's name on the illustrious Godson Rankings, and fate had granted him a glimpse of this enigmatic figure at the Honor Quest Ceremony for Cuthbert.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ranked 40th on the Godson Rankings, Marlon was second only to Cuthbert among the younger generation.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With the fall of Cuthbert, Marlon rose, unrivaled and supreme. His attendance at Osborne's forthcoming Honor Quest Ceremony was not just expected. Indeed, all signs pointed to Marlon as the ultimate contender to clash with Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne looked sullen.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why don't you leave this place?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony coldly demanded, "Osborne, the Fatebearer is beyond your reach! She is but a woman. Would you risk the ire of the Thornberry family for her sake? Would you plunge the entire Augustine family into despair for her?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony sneered, "Osborne, you are not without merit. Though your name does not grace the Godson Rankings, you are the first heir of the Augustine family of Rosmandi. With your status and strength, any woman would be within your grasp.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do not offend those you cannot afford to for a woman beyond your grasp! Do not invite your own demise for the fleeting affection of a woman!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony's words were laced with menace.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne scoffed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It is you who invite your own demise!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He declared with a frosty expression, "Release Clarissa. For the sake of the Thornberry family and Helios, I will show you mercy. Apologize to Clarissa, and I will let you go!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony was taken aback and gaped at him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She mused silently, "Had I misheard?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne knew of the Thornberry family and my great-grandfather, yet he dared to speak to me thus? Did he demand me to release Clarissa and make an apology?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was Osborne mad?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was he out of his mind?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I was the beloved daughter of the Thornberry family, and my brother was destined to inherit our legacy. My father, not only the patriarch of our esteemed family but also a deputy leader within the League of Divine Descent, commanded respect and authority. And then there was my great-grandfather, a colossus warrior, who had dominated the Quasi-Divine Rankings with his unparalleled strength for nigh on two hundred years.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I had never once apologized in my nearly thirty years of life.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The greatest challenge I had faced was learning to walk.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The most profound agony I had ever endured in my existence was none other than coffee!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Osborne presented me with a choice: release Clarissa and offer her an apology. Only then would he consider granting me freedom!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A shadow of gloom enveloped her features.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, you're playing with fire, seeking your own doom! Since you fail to recognize the path to your own salvation, do not fault me for my harshness! Even if you stand as the foremost heir to the Augustine family of Rosmandi, I'll kill you. And your family will not muster the courage to seek vengeance upon me!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Leave!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony launched a fierce assault to strike Osborne's chest.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a casual flick of his wrist, Osborne shattered her offensive.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ranked 398th on the Godson Rankings, Ebony was no minor figure, outranked by only forty or fifty among the younger generation. If Osborne met Ebony just half a month prior, he might have found himself outmatched against her. Even if victory were within his grasp, it would be a hard-won victory that demanded the revelation of numerous secret strengths.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet now, Osborne remained icy, not granting Ebony even the slightest hint of respect.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had faced stronger foes, including Abner, Cuthbert, and Mose from the Eityreia Organization, who ranked higher than Ebony on the Godson Rankings.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Osborne had killed them all.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, in these recent days, his prowess had surged dramatically, and he had also mastered the art of Explosive Force from Isa.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In his eyes, Ebony was but a trivial adversary.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With effortless might, he shattered Ebony's offensive, prompting an immediate shift in her demeanor.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You do possess some strength!" Ebony conceded.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But you are still no match for me! Feel the might of my Solar Realm!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, Ebony unleashed her Solar Realm, ensnaring Osborne within its blazing embrace.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ten scorching suns, radiating fearsome power, enveloped him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You must die!"</p><div class="pagination">
