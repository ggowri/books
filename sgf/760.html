  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, let's get one thing straight," Aleena said, her voice dead serious. "We gotta figure out how far this Eityreia bunch is willing to take this. Is it just a few loose cannons like Roger, or is the whole gang gunning for us Lamberts?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If it's just a handful, we might be able to handle it. We could say sorry, maybe pay 'em off. But if that doesn't cut it... Well, we Lamberts might keep to ourselves, but we're no pushovers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now, if the entire Eityreia gang's coming after us, we're in deep trouble. Saying sorry won't mean squat, and if it comes to blows...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We're toast."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett's fists tightened. "This is all on me. If it comes to that, just hand me over. I won't let the family take the heat for my mess."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aleena snapped, "Don't be stupid! We Lamberts don't throw our own under the bus. You're the oldest of our bunch. Don't ever say crap like that again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett hung his head, looking like a kicked puppy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aleena softened slightly. "I'll find a way to reach out to Roger and see what's really going on. I'll try to smooth things over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If that doesn't work, I'll go to the patriarch and have him deal with Eityreia Organization directly. We'll figure something out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No matter what, the family will protect you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"For now, just be careful. Stay within the Williamson family estate. Don't give them a chance to get at you. As long as we're here, Eityreia Organization won't dare make a move. Once this blows over, we'll be in the clear."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett, Stuart, and Vivian nodded, the weight of the situation evident on their faces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne and Emma exchanged a look but kept quiet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was a battle between the Lambert family and Eityreia Organization, and they were just caught in the crossfire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They didn't have the power to intervene, and they weren't about to try.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Saving Stuart had already been a stretch for Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There wasn't much more he could do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once the Williamson family's ceremony was over and they were back to their real lives, this whole mess would no longer be their concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, everyone, get some rest," Aleena said, waving them off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There's nothing more you can do right now. The family elders will handle it. Tomorrow's tournament should be interesting. There'll be a lot of people aiming for the Godson Rankings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Rhett, stay sharp! You're the strongest of our generation and the hope of the Lambert family. Tomorrow, give it everything you've got and secure a spot on that list."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett nodded, determination hardening his expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry, I'll give it my all tomorrow and make it onto that list!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Aleena dismissed them, and everyone slowly dispersed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Osborne stepped into his room and was about to close the door, Emma slipped in swiftly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne frowned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Aren't you supposed to be resting? What are you doing in my room?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma giggled. "I came here to rest, obviously! You wouldn't be so cold-hearted as to kick me out, would you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before he could respond, she threw her arms around his neck, clinging to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her eyes sparkled with affection, and she leaned in with puckered lips, clearly asking for a kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne sighed and gave her a look of mild exasperation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a wave of his hand, the air around them seemed to shimmer slightly, as if the entire room was suddenly cut off from the world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's smile widened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Come on, give me a kiss."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without waiting for a reply, she grabbed his face and planted a kiss on him, full of enthusiasm but lacking finesse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she finally pulled back, Osborne shook his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, you've had your kiss. Now, go back to your room. I need to focus on my training. You saw how strong those people were today. Every one of them is a serious contender.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In a little over twenty days, Godfather is going to host a ceremony for me, and all of them will be my competition. If I don't improve, that ceremony could turn into a complete embarrassment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He gently tried to usher her out, but Emma pouted, clearly displeased.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Seriously? You're that eager to get rid of me? Admit it, Osborne, you don't really want me here, do you? You didn't even kiss me back properly. You don't want to be with me, do you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her eyes started to well up, and her voice quivered, making her look even more pitiful.</p><div class="pagination">
