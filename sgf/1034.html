  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Bryce's help, Osborne found it even easier to kill their enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The twenty-six Class S clones had been fighting Bryce for some time, and though they were all still standing, they had wasted quite a bit of their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truth was that Bryce's only role had been to use his battered body to wear them down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne swung his Volt Hammer, a storm of crackling lightning surrounding him as he smashed down on the enemies one after another, killing them outright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he began to relish the feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt the Volt Hammer was more suited for this kind of assault than his Axe of Strength. The recoil as he struck his foes sent adrenaline surging through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne killed one enemy after another quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce was stunned by the efficiency of Osborne's onslaught. He poured every ounce of his strength into taking down a single weakened Medusa Queen, barely managing to do so, only to realize that Osborne had already taken out five or six enemies in the time it took him to get one!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speechless, he threw himself back into the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of enemies dwindled rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, there were only seven left, nineteen Class S clones were killed by the two of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they called it teamwork, the reality was that Osborne had eliminated sixteen of them, whereas Bryce had only managed to kill three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This realization left Bryce feeling defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "No way! I'm a Class S warrior! I'm older than Osborne! There are sixty enemies, and I can't just take credit for only three kills. If this gets out, I'll lose all my pride. How embarrassing would that be? I need to take down at least ten!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fueled by desperation, Bryce saw Osborne about to finish off a Wolf King and shouted, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, hold up! You've done enough. Let me handle the last seven! Stay back and rest!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Osborne's Volt Hammer hovered above the Wolf King's head, ready to strike, he stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tide of battle had already turned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With only seven Class S clones left, even if he stepped back, Bryce should be capable of handling it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! Go for it, Mr. Clarkson!" Osborne said, stepping aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce was ecstatic. "You got it, buddy! Just sit back and watch my show!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he charged forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce's strength was formidable; after all, he had once ranked in the top ten of the Godson Rankings, surpassing the likes of Marlon, Scarlett, and Cuthbert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he had broken through to be a Class S, his power was anything but ordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, power depended on who one was up against.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to an average Class S, Bryce was impressive&mdash;taking down ten Class S clones would be an easy case.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But compared to Osborne, it was entirely different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially now that Osborne had transformed after his martial art aura evolved. </span><span>Fighting ordinary Class S clones was a breeze for him; as long as he wasn't surrounded by more than thirty, he felt invincible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even against top-tier Class S foes, Osborne could hold his ground for a significant time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce was extraordinary, a genius in his own right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne? He was practically a monster!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Bryce finally had his chance to shine, hitting the remaining seven Class S clones relentlessly until they were coughing up blood. Before long, he had already taken down three of them, and he couldn't help but burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This feels amazing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the kind of battle I live for! As long as you're not stepping in to overshadow me, I feel unbeatable! Let's go, let's go, let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce was absolutely thrilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Bryce fought with Osborne by his side, he couldn't help but feeling being useless. He had managed to take down just one of the Class S clones, while Osborne had already taken five or six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when he faced the threat alone, a surge of confidence washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing against seven Class S clones, Bryce felt invincible, a true warrior in the heat of battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce thought, determination settling in, "From now on, I'll never team up with Osborne again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's a whole different breed, and I can't compete!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground trembled as Bryce single-handedly obliterated all seven clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of triumph flooded him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Finally, I've bagged ten! Sure, there's still fifty left from the total sixty, but at least I've got a respectable count now&mdash;can't be too ashamed of that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his chest puffed out in pride, Bryce made his way over to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wrapped his enormous arms around Osborne and exclaimed, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't thank you enough for showing up when you did. If you hadn't saved me, I'd have ended up as the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' Human Slave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clapped Osborne's back with enough force to resonate through the air, each thud echoing like thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, towering at over six feet three inches, found himself nearly dwarfed by Bryce, who was even taller.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the patting seemed jovial, he could feel an undercurrent of vindication.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied, shaking his head with a smile, "Hey, Mr. Clarkson, no need to thank me! Remember, back when I was in a tight spot, it was you who pulled me out of the fire. I'd probably be dead long ago if it weren't for you! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Let's get going! Kendra is waiting for us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne began to absorb the surrounding blood energy.</span></p><div class="pagination">
