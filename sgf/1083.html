  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Gerardo wasn't just pretending to be injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was genuinely hurt!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second divine corpse he had fused with was that of the Minotaur, a choice that might have worked wonders against others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Typically, even those stronger than him would struggle to penetrate his defenses, which were so formidable that even the most refined Point Blank Force would have a hard time breaking through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But unfortunately for him, Osborne was not just anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had learned both Deadly Force and Explosive Force from Isa, specifically tailored to counteract powerful defenses like Gerardo's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the refined level of mastery he had achieved in both techniques, Osborne was a force to be reckoned with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo was in for a rude awakening. He had never encountered anyone who could wield those techniques with such skill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed they were Isa's exclusive high-level martial art techniques, and even Gerardo, who had lived nearly a century, was clueless about their intricacies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, he was caught completely off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now transformed into a Vampire, Osborne unleashed the Breath of Celestial, channeling the power of his right leg's Divine Bone. The sheer force behind that kick was terrifying. Even with the Minotaur's essence coursing through him, Gerardo couldn't withstand it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sickening explosion, half of Gerardo's body erupted, and he lost an arm, leaving him in a pitiful state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he was not dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to his fusion with Goddess Medusa, Gerardo had an astounding recovery ability. Even with half his body blown apart, he could tap into her divine power to heal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the pain was excruciating, and he let out a horrific scream. "Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes turned bloodshot as he glared at Osborne, his mangled body rapidly sprouting flesh in a desperate attempt to heal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne wouldn't give him a moment's respite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fury and murderous intent he had kept bottled up surged forth uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted, "Gerardo! You killed my sister, and now I'm going to kill you for her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne charged forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's relentless assault came crashing down on Gerardo. Injured and desperate, Gerardo could only focus on defending himself and dodging the onslaught. When he couldn't evade, he was forced to confront Osborne head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with each clash, his injuries worsened rather than healed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cries of agony grew more desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Gerardo was completely overwhelmed. Osborne had the upper hand in strength, speed, and recovery. Gerardo tried to fight back, but the sheer gap in power rendered his efforts futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was being utterly pummeled!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for his fusion with the Minotaur and Goddess Medusa, granting him top-tier defenses and recovery, any other Class S warrior would have likely been killed by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's frenzied attacks were a cathartic release of all his pent-up anger and hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's condition deteriorated with each blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, a flicker of fear crossed Gerardo's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic set in as he realized he wanted to escape. In a desperate move, he tore open a Dimensional Space, hoping to use interdimensional travel to flee, regroup, and return even stronger to take revenge on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But sadly, he couldn't pull it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's spatial power, while still not quite on Gerardo's level, had improved significantly. The gap was no longer as vast, and at such close range, he wouldn't let Gerardo slip away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the dimensional rift started to form, Osborne shattered it with a single blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's face turned even gloomier. Since Osborne had ascended to Class S, his spatial power had surged. Even if Gerardo had once been able to escape, now that option was off the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "What am I going to do? I can't win a fight, and I can't escape! Am I really going to die here today? I won't accept that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst the fray, Gerardo caught a fleeting glimpse of Armstrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armstrong was watching from a distance, his face a mask of shock, not just at Gerardo's fusion with two divine remains but also at the terrifying display of Osborne's prowess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These guys are freaks!" Armstrong thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he was a top-tier Class S warrior, Armstrong was certain that neither Gerardo nor Osborne were within his reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Gerardo on the brink of collapse, Armstrong hesitated for a moment before preparing to make his escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, Gerardo spotted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo shouted, "Armstrong! Are you just gonna stand there and watch?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help me! Together, we can take him down! Are you really going to let me die here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armstrong ignored the plea, fleeing even faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's face contorted with anger. "Armstrong, think carefully! You've already made an enemy of the Augustine family. If you don't take him out now, he'll only grow stronger. He'll come for you to wipe out your Thornberry family and the League of Divine Descent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry up and help!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you help me kill him, I can give you cloning technology!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
