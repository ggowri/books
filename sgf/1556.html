  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fabian and Gilbert's faces turned ashen. They were up against Darren, a late-stage Deity Overlord, and even at their peak, they wouldn't stand a chance against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, battered and bruised, they realized they might not even escape with their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Desperately, they shouted, "You can't kill us! We're warriors of the Wild Bull Clan and the Crimson Ironhoof Clan! Do you really think a lowly human like you can handle the wrath of our clans?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let us go, and we can bury the hatchet. We promise we won't come after you again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fabian shot a terrified glance at Osborne, recognizing that Darren, despite being a late-stage Deity Overlord, was entirely under Osborne's command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne didn't order their release, they had no hope of survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne grinned, an unsettling smile that sent chills down their spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You think threatening me with the Wild Bull Clan and the Crimson Ironhoof Clan is going to work? Ha! I have a little quirk&mdash;I don't respond well to threats. If you had begged for mercy, I might have considered sparing you. But here you are, still trying to intimidate me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're just digging your own graves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can't wait to see if the Wild Bull Clan and Crimson Ironhoof Clan will come looking for revenge over your pathetic selves!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Osborne's cold command hung in the air. Darren wasted no time and charged forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fabian and Gilbert's faces twisted in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How dare he? We've already mentioned the names of the Wild Bull Clan and the Crimson Ironhoof Clan, yet he still intends to kill us? Doesn't he fear the consequences?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But there was no time for second-guessing. They knew they couldn't match Darren's power, so they unleashed their remaining strength in a desperate attempt to defend themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They also called on the warriors from the Wolfe and Keynes families to join the fray, hoping to lessen the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, in the face of Darren's late-stage Deity Overlord prowess, the few Celestial Deity and Transcendent Deity warriors from the Wolfe and Keynes families were utterly outmatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The shockwaves from Darren's attacks left them battered, barely able to stand, let alone join the fight against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They could only watch in helpless frustration as their leaders were overwhelmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But soon, they wouldn't even have time to feel that frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From Spark Estate, a group of masked warriors surged forward, numbering in the dozens. All of them were Celestial Deity level, with most being late-stage or even peak Celestial Deity warriors. Without uttering a word, they charged straight at the warriors from the Wolfe and Keynes families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though their faces were hidden, the air around them was thick with a palpable, iron-willed aura. Their strikes were ruthless, each movement precise and efficient, a clear indication of countless battles fought together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the face of this elite force, the hundreds of warriors from the Wolfe and Keynes families were no match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were like blades of grass before a lawnmower, falling one after another with the relentless assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blood painted the path in front of Spark Estate, a grim testament to the violence unfolding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Onlookers from the various factions who had gathered to witness the spectacle were left in stunned silence. They watched in disbelief as Darren mercilessly overpowered Fabian and Gilbert while the masked Celestial Deity warriors wreaked havoc on the Wolfe and Keynes families. Shock and horror etched across their faces as they took in the brutal scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One onlooker exclaimed in disbelief, "This Spark of Blaze has so many warriors! They have a late-stage Deity Overlord and dozens of late-stage and even peak Celestial Deity warriors!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another added, "With that kind of strength, they could easily be considered a second-tier power in Wild Flame City. They'd rank among the best of those second-tier forces!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone interjected, "But why would they go so far as to destroy the Wolfe family and the Keynes family? Aren't they afraid of provoking the entire Wild Bull Clan and Crimson Ironhoof Clan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Confusion spread among the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Wolfe family and the Keynes family had already backed down, eager to resolve their grievances. In their view, the best course of action for Osborne would have been to let them go and settle the matter peacefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, that was how most factions in the Human Community would handle the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The power of the Human Community in Wild Flame City was undeniably weak, not to mention that the entire Human Community in East Zone was often bullied by the various clans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, surprisingly, Osborne seemed unwilling to let bygones be bygones and was instead intent on wiping out the Wolfe and Keynes families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Wasn't that asking for trouble?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The spectators shared puzzled glances, questioning Osborne's apparent disregard for the potential consequences from the Wild Bull Clan and Crimson Ironhoof Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, overhearing their murmurs from a distance, couldn't help but let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He mused, "Am I supposed to fear the Wild Bull Clan and Crimson Ironhoof Clan's retaliation?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the grand scheme of things, neither of them is particularly formidable, ranking near the bottom among the clans. According to my intel, neither has produced a Deity King warrior yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why should I be afraid?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If I let the Wolfe family and the Keynes family go, how would I establish my authority? So..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He ordered, "Kill them all! Not a single one is to be spared!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
