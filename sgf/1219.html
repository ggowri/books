  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne cast another glance at the thirty-six deities of the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, they were eagerly gathering information about the state of Blue Planet through Damian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The conversation had shifted to Newport City and the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Joseph Deschanel, if we want to dominate the world, our first target must be Rosmandi! It's one of the mightiest nations on Blue Planet, brimming with resources and a large population. Once we fully conquer Rosmandi, we'll have a steady supply of slaves and cannon fodder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right now, the ruling power there is the Augustine family of Newport City! They call themselves the first Ancient Family of Rosmandi, and their leader is known as Rosmandi's Godfather," Damian explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph simply smiled, his demeanor calm and unruffled. He asked, "And how strong is this Augustine family? What about this so-called Godfather of Rosmandi?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian said, flashing a grin, "Well, the Augustine family in Newport City has some solid strength, but honestly, they can't hold a candle to us! We've kept our true power under wraps, allowing others to believe that the Augustine family is the top dog in Rosmandi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even without ancestors lending your strength, I'm confident I could take down the Augustine family by myself! As for the Rosmandi's Godfather, he simply doesn't measure up to you guys. Still, I'll admit he has some impressive talent. Although we lack concrete intel, I'm certain he possesses the ability to overcome foes beyond his level. If he manages to break through and become a Junior Deity, he could pose some trouble for us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From what we estimate, he's been hard at work refining his Divine Bone and Divine </span><span>Flesh, preparing himself to forge a Divine Body and become a Junior Deity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian's words hung in the air, prompting a derisive chuckle from Joseph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A so-called genius who hasn't even made it to Junior Deity yet? What a joke!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This Augustine family hardly seems worth our time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I could send an Intermediate Deity over there, and they'd fold like a cheap tent! If they're smart and willing to become the Deschanel Clan's vassals, we might let them off the hook.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If not? We'll wipe them out without batting an eye!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly, the power players in this new world are a joke! Our biggest threats aren't the locals&mdash;they're those awakening Dark Deities!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, it's quite likely that other divine clans have methods to awaken early as well. If I'm right, that so-called League of Divine Descent you mentioned is probably a faction of some god's descendants!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need to establish our control over this world before they catch up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a determined glint in his eye, Joseph stood up, an aura of authority radiating from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got the lay of the land; let's kick things into gear! First, we handle the Beast Tide, then we take Rosmandi!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Joseph and his fellow deities prepared to depart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart raced, cold dread washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got to get out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Joseph and the others set off to deal with the Beast Tide, Osborne activated his interdimensional travel ability, quickly relocating to a spot just outside the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon members were still entangled in fierce combat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasted no time in giving orders. "Fall back! Gather at my side!" At his command, the Blood Demon members swiftly retreated from the chaos, regrouping around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's head back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne initiated interdimensional travel, leading over four thousand of his Blood Demon members back to the Augustine Bastion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he was sure they were secure, he turned his attention back to Hearin City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His decision to pull the Blood Demon members out wasn't taken lightly. He feared that if Joseph and the Deschanel Clan caught wind that they belonged to the Augustine family, they might target the Blood Demon without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood Demon was his ace in the hole&mdash;they couldn't afford any slip-ups.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battlefield now lay in ruins, with only the Ancient Families and wealthy clans of Hearin City left holding the line against the Beast Tide. The relentless onslaught of monstrous creatures surged forward, breaking through the defense as the Blood Demon's vital assistance had vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without the Blood Demon, the remaining forces struggled to hold their ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's happening?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are all the Blood Demon members from the Augustine family in Newport City suddenly pulling out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are they running away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have they given up on Hearin City?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic surged through the ranks of the Ancient Families and wealthy clans of Hearin City. Without the Blood Demon members holding the front line, they were left utterly exposed against the relentless Beast Tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chaos escalated quickly, leading to devastating losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear gripped them as they turned to flee, the cohesion of their forces unraveling before their eyes. The carnage wrought by the Beast Tide surged anew, threatening to engulf them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched the unfolding scene with a furrowed brow but refrained from intervening. He understood that the Deschanel Clan would soon make their move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to absorb the blood energy from here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon members have already taken down at least three thousand Class S Dark Exotic Beasts, not to mention the countless ordinary Dark Exotic Beasts and Ferocious Beasts. With millions of humans falling prey to this tide, the blood energy in this place is dense and potent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perfect timing&mdash;this will bolster the Blood Demon members. With this influx, the last thousand or so members should finally reach Peak Class S!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From there, it's only a matter of time before they forge their Divine Bone and Divine Flesh, breaking through to become true deities!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determined focus, Osborne glided through the parallel space, harnessing the rich blood energy that lingered on the battlefield. He sent it surging towards the Blood Demon members positioned miles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, inside the Augustine Bastion, those over a thousand Blood Demon members who hadn't yet achieved Peak Class S felt the awakening of power. They gathered together, ready to embrace the surge of energy&mdash;their breakthrough was imminent.</span></p><div class="pagination">
