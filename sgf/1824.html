  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pioneers of Starlight? Darren? Is that really you? How is this possible? I thought you all were wiped out by the Dark Deity Legion a year ago!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Connor Farnsworth, the leader of the patrol, looked utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren narrowed his eyes at him, suddenly recalling, "Connor! I can't believe it's you! You went from being a vice leader of the Pioneers of Starlight to the captain of the patrol? Hahaha, I didn't even recognize you at first! What a demotion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Going from vice leader to patrolman? That's just pathetic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren sneered, amusement dancing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Connor's expression darkened, anger flaring. "Darren! What does it matter to you? I'll be straight with you&mdash;your return changes nothing! This place now belongs to the Radiant Era Syndicate! We've evolved beyond what you knew!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't kid yourself. Even if just a handful of you Pioneers of Starlight have come back, it would be best if you all kept your distance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This base no longer belongs to you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you dare to act up here, you won't even know how you died!" Connor threatened, his tone dripping with menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren's face turned gloomy. He said with his voice icy, "Connor, are you threatening me? You think you're in a position to do that? A year ago, you were one of the vice leaders of the Radiant Era Syndicate, and I might have given you some respect! But now, you're just a patrol captain. You really think you can talk to me like that? Get out of my way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Darren unleashed a powerful aura around him&mdash;an unmistakable presence of a Deity King warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A year ago, Darren had been one of the vice leaders of the Pioneers of Starlight, at the late stage of Deity Overlord. Connor, also a vice leader back then, was stronger, at the peak of Deity Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Darren had ascended to become a Deity King warrior, while Connor remained just a peak Deity Overlord, having fallen from his previous rank to captain of a patrol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren had no reason to take him seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the overwhelming aura of a Deity King bore down on Connor, his face hardened dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Deity King!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Connor's expression soured, jealousy flashing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Darren, I can't believe you not only survived the Dark Deity Legion's onslaught but also broke through to become a Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But do you really think that just because you're a Deity King now, you can act however you want here? You're so naive! You have no idea how powerful the Radiant Era Syndicate has become!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if all of you here were Deity Kings, acting recklessly would be a death wish!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll give you one last warning&mdash;leave now, or you'll all die here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Connor stood his ground, not showing an ounce of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren couldn't help but laugh, a derisive grin spreading across his face. "Oh really? Let's put that to the test! Let's see just how strong the Radiant Era Syndicate really is! Now, get down on the ground!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Darren made his move, slamming his hand down in a swift motion, unleashing a massive divine power that crashed down on Connor and his patrol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you?!" Connor exclaimed in shock, attempting to dodge, but his speed was no match for Darren's Deity King prowess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the colossal divine power struck Connor and the rest of the patrol, sending them sprawling to the ground, blood spraying from their mouths as they struggled to comprehend what had just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden commotion drew the attention of many more members of the Radiant Era Syndicate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, hundreds, even thousands, of figures appeared in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they witnessed Darren slam Connor and his patrol into the ground, their faces hardened dramatically. A wave of fury washed over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone's causing a ruckus in the Radiant Era Syndicate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The roar of a thousand voices echoed, potent killing intent enveloping Osborne and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, everyone in Darren's group remained calm, showing no sign of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren stood at the forefront, a proud smirk on his face, and shouted, "Listen up, everyone in the Radiant Era Syndicate! I am Darren Pollitt of the Pioneers of Starlight! I'm back, and this is our base!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You Radiant Era Syndicate scoundrels need to get the hell out of here! Otherwise, you'll have a lot to regret!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice boomed like thunder, resonating throughout the entire camp, ensuring that everyone could hear him clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Radiant Era Syndicate exchanged glances, their expressions shifting. Then, they sneered in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What nonsense is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Pioneers of Starlight were wiped out ages ago! This place belongs to the Radiant Era Syndicate now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to live, get the hell out of here before our leader loses his temper! Otherwise, you'll all be dead meat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the thousands of Radiant Era Syndicate members surrounded Osborne and his team, their spirits ablaze, excitement and bloodlust in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold voice cut through the chaos. "Enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, a group of over a dozen powerful figures emerged from within the camp. Each one radiated immense strength, all of them Deity King warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At their forefront was a mid-stage Deity King.</span></p><div class="pagination">
