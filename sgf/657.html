  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, if Osborne retreated, the Werewolf Duke's sharp claws would tear the entire villa into pieces. Even the sturdy safe house could not withstand his claw attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Break!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could neither retreat nor hide, he could only fight head-on, punching, breaking most of the Werewolf Duke's attacks. However, a small part of the attacks still passed through his fists and hit his martial art aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hiss!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp blades penetrated the martial art aura. Although most of its power was consumed, it still left wounds on Osborne's chest, with blood flowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, the Werewolf Duke seemed even more excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He attacked faster and faster, as if he wanted to take advantage of the victory and kill Osborne here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked down at the wound on his chest. His face was grim. And he said coldly, "I can't defend myself. In that case, let's hurt each other!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Point Blank Force!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne changed his strategy and used Point Blank Force to exert his strength. Although this would allow the Werewolf Duke's attacks to penetrate his defense more often and leave injuries on his body, his attacks could also penetrate the Werewolf Duke's defense and injure the Werewolf Duke!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hiss!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body was covered with numerous tiny wounds, and the Werewolf Duke was not feeling well either. Osborne's </span><span>Point Blank</span><span> Force was so strong in penetrating power that it penetrated the Werewolf's defense again and again, leaving tiny penetrating wounds on Werewolf's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all bleeding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, both sides were soon covered in blood. The intense pain made the Werewolf raise his head and howl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What the Werewolf Duke could not accept the most was that his powerful recovery ability was actually inferior to Osborne's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After fighting for a long time, Osborne had lost a lot of blood, but the wounds on his body were recovering at a speed visible to the naked eye. Although his face was pale, he was not seriously injured at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the contrary, the Werewolf Duke had no time to recover from his injuries. He became weak, making it difficult for him to break through Osborne's martial art aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Werewolf Duke roared angrily and finally found an opportunity. He retreated to a distance, stared at Osborne angrily and unwillingly, and began to recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the fight continued, he would be seriously injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Werewolf Duke No. 9, you can't do it either!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that only I can deal with him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, the Tauren Duke came out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at the Tauren with a grim expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that these five people were ready to fight a round-robin battle. They made sure that Osborne could not escape, so they treated Osborne as a toy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted and said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because this was also a good thing for him. Otherwise, if the five rushed at him, he would not be able to defeat them, and most importantly, he could not escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that case, Clarissa would be killed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced at Clarissa's position with a solemn expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He now only hoped that Clarissa could complete the breakthrough as soon as possible! Only then could he find a chance to escape with Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, he could only buy as much time as possible for Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tauren Duke No. 7, be careful! This guy is a freak. His strength is not inferior to Titan Duke No. 7. His attack penetration is not inferior to mine. And his defense is not much worse than yours!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And his ability to recover is even stronger than all of ours!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Werewolf Duke reminded the Tauren Duke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Tauren Duke smiled, "Don't worry. I have seen through his strength. No matter how strong he is, he can't penetrate my skin! His </span><span>Point Blank</span><span> Force can penetrate your body, but it can't penetrate my skin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In short, he won't have any chance to beat me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, the Tauren Duke was already standing in front of Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boy, use your greatest strength to punch me first! Don't worry. I wouldn't defend or fight back. Go ahead. I want to feel it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, the Tauren smiled mockingly, which made people feel uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said sternly, "You don't defend yourself or fight back? I'm afraid I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Tauren Duke laughed as if he had heard a joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boy, if you have the ability, just do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, the Tauren Duke actually stood there, dissipating all his strength and even putting his hands behind his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Is this a conspiracy? Or is the Tauren really as confident as he appears? Does he think that I can't break his defense no matter what?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who cares? Since he asked me to hit him, I'll satisfy him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking, Osborne took action.</span></p><div class="pagination">
