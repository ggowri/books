  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kendra, which direction should we go?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne stood on the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, with only Kendra by his side.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This hunting operation made Kendra a crucial figure because she possessed special abilities.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as Kendra had seen someone, she could remember their emitted aura. No matter where they fled, where they hid, or even if they used treasures like the Sublime Concealment Orb to completely hide or alter their aura, they couldn't escape Kendra's tracking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kendra's power was the key to Osborne's confidence in successfully hunting.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Osborne's current strength could also track the enemy's aura, it was far inferior to Kendra's ability.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt that if Kendra were Frederick's person, they wouldn't need to run at all and could just wait to be caught.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, Kendra was his ally.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Kendra closed her eyes, seemingly sensing something. After a while, she spoke, "Osborne, those fifty-plus people have now scattered! But they're all to the east, and they seem to know we're hiding in the west, so they're searching for us like casting a net to catch fish!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing this, Osborne smiled and nodded, saying, "Can you sense which direction Frederick and Callista are in? We need to avoid them and stay as far away as possible!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This way, when we take action, they won't be able to rush over to support immediately!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kendra nodded and pointed in a direction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They're all over there!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and said, "Alright! Then let's deal with those farthest from them first!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne activated the Ascending Sacred Sanctum and quickly vanished from the spot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that his Ascending Sacred Sanctum has been fully restored.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the help of the Warfare Ancient Tree, the Ascending Sacred Sanctum regained all its power as a Supreme Sacred Sanctum, and all its Divine Marks were restored, making it even stronger than before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among all the Supreme Sacred Artifacts Osborne possesses, the Ascending Sacred Sanctum is arguably the strongest, second only to the Imperial Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Osborne's current cultivation level, he can fully wield the Ascending Sacred Sanctum to rapidly approach his prey at astonishing speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's prey totaled nearly thirty people.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These people all came out of the Skyfall Casket alive, including Quinn, Naomi, and the leaders of various sects.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They have one thing in common: like May, they all entered that eerie jungle, their Soul Current Ocean was invaded by the Soulbane Parasite, and they are already controlled by it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne plans to find them one by one, defeat and subdue them, then have Drum control the Soulbane Parasite in their Soul Current Ocean to take control of these people.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This will not only weaken Frederick's forces but also strengthen their own.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By the time of the final battle, their chances of victory will greatly increase.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, that person is just ahead!" Suddenly, Kendra said, pointing in a direction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately activated Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He clearly saw an old man, the sect leader of First-rate Power. However, back in Necropolis City, to survive, he had already sworn allegiance to Frederick and was now entirely under Frederick's command.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The old man's cultivation level was only at Common Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obviously, he didn't gain much in Necropolis City; otherwise, his cultivation level would at least be at Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My first hunting target is him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A trace of icy killing intent flashed in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His cultivation level was Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, one level lower than the opponent, but strength has never been solely determined by cultivation level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, Osborne couldn't have easily subdued May.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>May's cultivation level is at Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, far stronger than this elder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne did not rush to launch an attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew he was not facing a single enemy, but a group of enemies!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once he launched an attack, the opponent would definitely contact others immediately. The other enemies were not far away and would quickly come to support.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne moved a bit slower, he might get surrounded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he must be fast!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had to quickly take down and control the opponent before being surrounded! Ideally, he wouldn&rsquo;t even give them a chance to send a distress signal, silently dealing with and subduing the prey.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne began to think of a strategy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "The Dragon Binding Rope must be used! It can suppress the prey, leaving them unable to resist, making it easier for Drum to use the Demon Dragon to extract the Soulbane Parasite and control it, then let the Soulbane Parasite continue parasitizing the target to control them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Invictus Seal must be used too!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Invictus Seal can form the Invictus Field! With the strength of the Invictus Field, even a Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness cannot easily break through!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Apocalypse Bow can't be used...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My prey is too weak, and the Apocalypse Bow is too strong&mdash;just one arrow would kill them instantly! So, the Bloodwrought Bow and Warfare Scythe will be enough..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly simulated the battle in his mind to ensure he could defeat and control the opponent as fast as possible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But there's still a problem&mdash;his opponent is a Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior. Even if he's just a Common Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, without killing him, Osborne can't stop him from sending a distress signal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if he's fast, he might still get surrounded by enemies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne continued thinking, "I must find a way to stop him from sending a distress signal! Otherwise, even if I succeed, my location will be exposed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If the plan gets exposed, its effectiveness will be greatly reduced!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, he came up with an idea.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How could I forget this!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took out a massive pitch-black stone tablet, engraved with "Domain Suppression Stele"!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Activating the Domain Suppression Stele can suppress all energy flow within a million miles! Any being can only rely on physical strength, unable to use any other powers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes were filled with excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The enemy must use energy to send out a distress signal, but the Domain Suppression Stele can suppress all energy flow within a million miles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With energy unable to flow, the distress signal naturally cannot be sent out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And relying solely on physical strength is completely useless for other Human Community warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, among the same cultivation level, there are few races weaker than the Human Community in strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But </span><span>Osborne</span><span> is an exception.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His physical body was already incredibly strong, and after absorbing a trace of Primordial Energy, he became so powerful that even Primordial and Flash felt a bit jealous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the same cultivation level, even the physically strongest Silicon-based Lifeform may not necessarily be stronger than Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, the Domain Suppression Stele can exert its strongest effect in Osborne's hands.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Relying solely on physical strength, Osborne fears no one, not even Frederick, and can easily defeat him!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, the Domain Suppression Stele is merely a Supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Frederick's cultivation level is too high, already nearing Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, making Osborne worry that using the Domain Suppression Stele might not fully suppress him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "It seems I need to hang the Domain Suppression Stele on the Warfare Ancient Tree, letting it continue to enhance the stele's grade! It might be of great use in the future!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, my current opponent is merely a Common Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness. The Domain Suppression Stele will definitely work on him!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's do it this way!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne finalized the battle plan and immediately took action.</span></p><div class="pagination">
