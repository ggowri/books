  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce determination, Osborne launched a powerful punch forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive thunder dragon materialized, roaring as it surged toward Tobey. The moment Tobey saw it, his expression shifted to one of sheer terror. Myron and Sara had been severely injured by Osborne's thunder dragon and were still unable to rise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Tobey believed he was stronger than both of them, the thought of facing Osborne's thunder dragon head-on filled him with dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was an attack at the full level of a Deity Overlord&mdash;a level that was not easily withstood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, fear didn't paralyze him. Instead, he swung the Supreme Malevolence Sword and unleashed a fierce slash, enveloping himself in a powerful aura of divine power for defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, he underestimated the sheer might of Osborne's attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thunder dragon was far from something he could shatter; despite the formidable nature of the Supreme Malevolence Sword, its potential was limited against such a vast power discrepancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Tobey was still only at the peak of Celestial Deity, and he couldn't fully tap into the weapon's true capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To unleash its full power, one would need to be at the pinnacle of Deity Overlord or even at the level of a Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thunder dragon tore through Tobey's defenses with ease, sending him hurtling backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, his complexion turning pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After just one exchange, Tobey was utterly certain that he was no match for Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, seeing Tobey withstand his attack, Osborne swiftly activated the </span><span>Thunderform</span><span> Flash, rushing towards Tobey with lightning speed, intent on swiftly resolving the confrontation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey's eyes widened in alarm as he reacted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a frenzy, he reached into his Dimensional Bag and pulled out the Malevolence Airship, hurling it at Osborne with all his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Malevolence Airship expanded rapidly in the air, slamming down like a massive mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scowled and delivered a punch to counter it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massive recoil caused Osborne to stand firm, but the airship was propelled away harmlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his shock, the Malevolence Airship emerged unscathed, not even a scratch to be seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Osborne blurted, astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His attack had struck the Malevolence Airship directly and yet failed to shatter it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way a mere Ultimate Malevolence Airship could withstand such force!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A realization hit him like a thunderbolt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be...the Supreme Malevolence Airship?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bingo!" Tobey laughed, his confidence surging as he dived into the airship, which transformed into a vessel measuring several yards long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With ease, he stood on the deck, sneering down at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right! This is the Supreme Malevolence Airship! I must admit, you've got some serious strength, lowly human. Right now, I'm not your match. But if you think you can kill me or take my Supreme Malevolence Sword, you're dreaming!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With this airship on my side, what do you possibly have to challenge me? The defenses are so robust that even a Deity King's attack would have trouble getting through! What's more, this baby's got two main cannons and ten secondary ones!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You might be a Deity Overlord warrior, but even then, I wouldn't need to use the main cannons; just firing all ten secondary cannons will be more than enough to wipe you out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Prepare to meet your end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Tobey finished, ten cannon turrets emerged from the Malevolence Airship. He filled them with Essence Crystals, and the barrels began to glow ominously, radiating a terrifying energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt the pressure mount, his eyes widening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's some serious firepower! Just the secondary cannons alone are nearly on par with a Deity Overlord's might! A Deity Overlord would definitely be in for a world of hurt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet his composure remained intact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured to himself, "The Supreme Malevolence Airship, huh? I was just thinking about how to acquire one from the Artisan Institute. And here you are, practically handing it to me! If I kill you, both the Supreme Malevolence Sword and the airship will be mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he charged at the Malevolence Airship without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey's face hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! You're asking for it! Open fire!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ten secondary cannons swiftly locked onto Osborne, unleashing a torrent of devastating energy blasts. The sheer speed of the attacks was staggering&mdash;there was no escaping them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with his </span><span>Thunderform</span><span> Flash, Osborne wouldn't avoid the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead of trying to dodge, Osborne made a bold move&mdash;he simply didn't bother to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he invoked his spatial power and vanished from his spot, reappearing right in front of the Supreme Malevolence Airship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The barrage of cannon fire flew into empty air as Osborne's sudden appearance rendered Tobey's attack futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Tobey could process what just happened, Osborne landed a powerful punch on the Malevolence Airship, sending ripples of force radiating outward. Yet, against all odds, both the airship and Tobey remained unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It really can withstand a couple of attacks from a Deity King! With defenses like that, any Deity Overlord warrior would be left in despair. What a treasure!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His excitement was palpable, his eyes gleaming with ambition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it won't do me any good! I don't need to break through your defenses; I just have to kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a final, determined look, Osborne slipped into the parallel space.</span></p><div class="pagination">
