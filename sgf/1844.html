  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan's expression darkened as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow, surprised. "Your father is injured? What happened? Does he really need the white Miracle Elixir to recover?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan's eyes dimmed with the weight of his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not long ago, my father was caught in an ambush by the Dark Deity Legion at the border. The Hudson family's forces&mdash;thousands strong&mdash;were surrounded. To protect the others, my father and a few others used a forbidden technique from the Hudson family, draining their life force to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He was lucky to come back alive, but he's nearly spent. The only thing that can really help him now is the white Miracle Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unfortunately, our family is struggling. There are too many injured, and we've exhausted our supply of white Miracle Elixirs. My father isn't exactly at the top of the hierarchy in the Hudson family, and there are others who need the elixirs more urgently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My mother, sister, and I scraped together some Essence Crystals, hoping to buy a white Miracle Elixir for him, but with Kurt here, it feels hopeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He has deep pockets and won't let me get my hands on one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Tristan's gaze fell even further, a shadow of despair creeping into his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Without the white Miracle Elixir, my father's life force will dwindle until there's nothing left. And when that happens..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clenched his fists, unable to finish the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, mulling over the situation. "Using the Hudson family's forbidden technique drained his life force too much? It's not necessarily true that he needs the white Miracle Elixir. Both Hannah and I could heal him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't know Tristan well enough to offer his help outright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, the Hudson family might suspect ulterior motives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he said, "Don't lose hope! Kurt is just a man. He might not be able to snag the Miracle Elixir, either. Maybe the white Miracle Elixir will still find its way to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan sighed heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could that be..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bit his lip, his gaze locked onto the white Miracle Elixir on the auction stage, filled with longing and frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Kurt in the picture, he might have had a fighting chance with the Essence Crystals he had gathered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, it felt futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ladies and gentlemen, the Miracle Elixir auction is officially underway! These ten Miracle Elixirs have all been sourced from the Sanctum of Light, obtained from the Apocalypse Divine Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all know how challenging and dangerous it is to acquire these elixirs, not to mention the element of luck involved! Without further ado, let's start with the red Miracle Elixirs!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The opening bid for the first red Miracle Elixir is eighty Celestial Crystals, or eight thousand Ultimate Essence Crystals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the auctioneer's voice echoed through the room, a heavy silence fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one made a bid, but nearly every eye was drawn to Kurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now completely composed, Kurt basked in the attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled with an air of superiority, "Don't hold back, everyone! Feel free to bid! I, Kurt, am not the type to intimidate others. Miracle Elixirs are precious, and it's only natural that everyone wants them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go ahead and bid! I won't hold any grudges!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to sweep his gaze across the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of resignation hung in the air as everyone surveyed the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all knew Kurt too well. Despite his casual words, anyone brave enough to compete with him for the Miracle Elixir would surely face his wrath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The consequences of inciting his displeasure could be dire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Kurt was the son of a Supernal Deity King, a figure of considerable power within the Dukedom Level Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would dare challenge him at an auction?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected, no one stepped forward to place a bid, and Kurt reveled in the silence, a smug satisfaction washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he raised his bidding paddle and said, "It seems everyone here is my senior, and your cultivation levels are all higher than mine. If no one's interested in this red Miracle Elixir that can elevate your cultivation, then I won't hesitate. I need it for my own advancement! I bid eight thousand Ultimate Essence Crystals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words hung in the air as he cast a sweeping glance around the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd responded with nods of approval, eager to curry favor with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Baxter is already in the mid-stage of Deity King. Among the younger generation in Apocalypse City, there are few who can match his level! If he advances again, he'll truly stand out among his peers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Congratulations, Mr. Baxter!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Baxter, you embody the spirit of a Supernal Deity King!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flattery made Kurt beam with pride, and he graciously acknowledged their compliments with a few polite words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The auctioneer from the Luminous Commerce Center asked calmly, unfazed by Kurt's behavior, "Eight thousand Ultimate Essence Crystals! Is there anyone willing to bid higher?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eight thousand Ultimate Essence Crystals, going once!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eight thousand Ultimate Essence Crystals, going twice!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eight thousand Ultimate Essence Crystals, going thr&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the gavel was about to fall, a soft voice cut through the tension, freezing the auctioneer's hand mid-air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One hundred Celestial Crystals!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
