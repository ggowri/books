  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda was now more anxious than Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty-eight Element Gold Crystals&mdash;this was an enormous fortune. Even as a princess of the Nature Elf Clan, she had never seen so many Element Gold Crystals in one place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Nature Elf Clan had fallen from grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, even other Elf Royal Families found it hard to come by such wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mere thought of those twenty-eight Element Gold Crystals was enough to drive any elf prince or princess into a frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's breath quickened, her eyes sparkling with greed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on! Lead the way! If we get there late, we'll miss out!" Alfreda urged, her impatience palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her haste, she seemed to overlook a crucial question&mdash;how did Osborne know about the twenty-eight Element Gold Crystals in the first place?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps she hadn't overlooked it at all; she was simply too clever to dig too deep into Osborne's secrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Follow me!" Osborne replied, his urgency evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he didn't care much for the other Element Gold Crystals, those seven Spatial Gold Crystals were a different story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could break through Level Ten of space elemental essence, his power would skyrocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pushed himself to the limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the advantage of Satan's Eye, he didn't have to worry about being ambushed by Phantom Worms. He accelerated, covering the distance back to the main chasm in just over twenty minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Osborne found the branch of the chasm that his twenty-fifth clone had explored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground was littered with countless footprints.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression hardened slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda noticed the tracks too, her demeanor turning serious. "There are so many footprints&mdash;at least a hundred people have entered this branch! There's more than one exploration team in there, at least two!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, realizing the implications.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The teams that had entered the Umbra Earth had already suffered losses in the mushroom forest and weren't at full strength. Yet here, in this branch, there were at least a hundred people&mdash;two exploration teams at the very least.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He muttered, anxiety creeping in, "This could be a problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's hope these teams aren't too strong! Otherwise, we might be in for a tough fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the knowledge that at least two teams were inside, Osborne didn't hesitate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pressed on deeper into the chasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, his cultivation level had reached Ascension Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "My cultivation level has broken through to Ascension Two, and my power has increased significantly. I'm not afraid to confront an average Ascension Five Supernal Deity King head-on. As long as they're not as monstrous as Alfreda, I'm confident I can take them down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, I have the absolute forbidden zone as my trump card! If I unleash it at Ascension Two, I can suppress Ascension Five to Ascension Two, Ascension Six to Ascension Four, and Ascension Seven to Ascension Six!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That means, as long as my enemies don't have special means to counter my absolute forbidden zone, even if they're Ascension Six, they'll be brought down to Ascension Four and easily defeated by me, unless it's an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, I'm not equipped to handle an Ascension Seven! But even if they're an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King, after being suppressed to Ascension Six, it would be tough for them to kill me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these thoughts swirling in his mind, confidence surged within Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group entering the Umbra Earth consisted entirely of the younger generation, all under three hundred years old. The highest among them was Uriel, an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel was the only Ascension Seven present. The rest were at most Ascension Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that, as long as he didn't run into Uriel, Osborne had nothing to fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, being surrounded by multiple Ascension Six warriors would still pose a danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne pondered, he and Alfreda hurried deeper into the chasm branch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were getting close&mdash;very close&mdash;to the spot where the twenty-fifth clone had discovered the Element Gold Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a thunderous roar echoed through the air, pulling Osborne to a halt, his expression shifting to one of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exclaimed, "Someone's fighting up ahead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It must be those two exploration teams battling the Soulreaver Vine! But wait&mdash;it's been over half an hour, and the fight is still going? That Soulreaver Vine must be incredibly powerful to hold off </span><span>the </span><span>two teams for so long!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's surprise morphed into concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that the Soulreaver Vine is the biggest obstacle here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they crept closer, Osborne activated his Satan's Eye, finally getting a clear view of the situation unfolding ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes widened in shock, a fierce glint flashing across his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before him, over a hundred members from two exploration teams were engaged in a fierce battle against a bizarre plant covered in menacing thorns. The Soulreaver Vine, with its dark, twisting tendrils resembling whips, lashed out in every direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King would find it difficult to withstand a strike; a direct hit would shatter their divine power defenses, and if they didn't retreat quickly, the vines would ensnare them and drain their divine energy, leaving them lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Soulreaver Vine on par with an Ascension Six Supernal Deity King!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what truly astonished Osborne wasn't the Soulreaver Vine itself; it was the two exploration teams attacking it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading them were none other than Prince Desmond and Princess Monica!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Desmond and Monica were only at Ascension Four, hiding at a distance and directing their teammates from afar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desmond commanded, his voice cutting through the chaos, "Group Three, flank from the side!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Group Two, fall back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Group Five, hurry and assist Group Two!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Group One, hold your ground!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had to be said&mdash;while Desmond's combat abilities were average, his leadership skills were commendable. The two exploration teams, lacking any Ascension Six Supernal Deity Kings and only featuring a handful of Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings alongside several Ascension Fours, were holding their own against the Soulreaver Vine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the creature's formidable defenses and terrifying attacks, which could easily take down even a typical Ascension Six Supernal Deity King, Desmond and Monica's teams displayed remarkable teamwork under Desmond's guidance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Soulreaver Vine was struggling to gain the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this continued, the Soulreaver Vine would eventually be worn down to nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And those twenty-eight Element Gold Crystals? They would fall into the hands of Prince Desmond and Princess Monica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're almost there!" Desmond exclaimed, excitement bubbling in his voice as he and Monica locked their eyes on the Element Gold Crystals shimmering near the Soulreaver Vine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their breaths quickened, anticipation coursing through them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had faced terrible luck over the past two days in the Umbra Earth, losing nearly half their team in the mushroom forest and the Death Chasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with only about a hundred and twenty members left across both teams, they had yet to find anything of value.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, those twenty-eight Element Gold Crystals were within reach&mdash;just a Soulreaver Vine stood between them and their prize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could they not be thrilled?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go! Speed it up! That Soulreaver Vine is on its last legs; we need to finish it off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desmond's eyes sparkled with excitement.</span></p><div class="pagination">
