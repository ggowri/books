  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Training Base No. 6, there were a total of twenty instructors and five hundred students.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, there were three Class AA instructors and seventeen Class A+ instructors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the students, there were ten Class A, four hundred and thirty Class A-, and sixty Class B+ students.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them had mastered one or more advanced martial arts techniques and possessed the power to transform into blood clan vampires. Their strengths were not weak, and they could cooperate well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne had higher demands now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt that the strength of the entire Training Base No. 6 was still a bit unsatisfying, so he wanted to use blood energy to enhance all their strengths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing No. 1 trembling, Osborne smiled faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need to get so excited."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No. 1 spoke with difficulty, "Mr. Augustine, I-I'm not excited. I'm scared. This is the </span><span>power of the blood clan Ancestor, and I can't bear it. Its existence makes our blood boil."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly realized that the blood energy in the Blood Cross could cause immense pressure on transformed metahumans like No. 1.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waving his hand, he immediately calmed down the agitation in everyone's blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Distribute it. Each person will receive a drop of blood energy. How much improvement you can achieve depends on yourselves. If there is an opportunity in the future, I will distribute more to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne condensed five hundred drops of blood energy, feeling a slight emptiness in the Blood Cross' energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this did not affect the power of the Blood Cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could replenish it by devouring the blood essence of enemies in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No. 1 was extremely excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately summoned the leaders of various combat groups and began to distribute the blood energy, allowing them to absorb and enhance their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Buzz!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, a dense wave of energy surged on the training ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne saw that almost everyone transformed into blood clan vampires, and their aura rose significantly after absorbing the blood energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most significant improvement was seen in the seventeen Class A+ instructors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their cultivation base was already close to reaching Class AA, and with the help of the blood energy, their aura instantly broke through a critical point, reaching Class AA one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, all seventeen Class A+ instructors made it to Class AA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This situation greatly surprised Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected that blood energy would be so beneficial to these people, either. Just a drop of blood energy was equivalent to several years or even more than a decade of arduous cultivation for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After stabilizing their cultivation levels, the seventeen instructors were equally astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knelt on one knee in front of Osborne and thanked him loudly for granting them the blood energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waved his hand and observed the changes among the students.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were not as strong as the instructors, so they absorbed the blood energy at a slower pace. The first ones to absorb all the blood energy were the ten Class A students.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their aura also elevated to a higher level, with half of them directly reaching Class A+ and the other half coming exceptionally close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was once again amazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is truly amazing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the four hundred and thirty Class A- students, Osborne sighed inwardly, "They had failed to break through to Class A despite attempting it previously. It's fortunate enough that they survived, but they will have no opportunity in this lifetime to further advance and become true Class A masters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne suddenly discovered, to his shock, that one of the Class A- students' aura abruptly expanded, swiftly surpassing the Class A realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only he but even No. 1 and the other instructors were shocked as they stared at that person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Class A- students can still level up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did he just break through Class A?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hiss!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this situation, everyone present at this moment couldn't help but gasp, and their eyes became extremely confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Class A- students could continue to break through?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was something that had never happened before!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this wasn't just a coincidence or accident. Soon, a group of Class A- students began to break through one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After absorbing the blood energy, they broke free from the restraints of Class A- and became true Class A masters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Over four hundred masters?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hiss!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne couldn't help but gasp in astonishment. The improvement achieved was far better than his best expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the sixty Class B+ students entered the breakthrough state as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were also challenging the Class A realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Usually, this process would consume a significant amount of time, several days, or even more than a month, and the chances of failure were high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, these sixty Class B+ students nearly broke through the Class A barrier within just a dozen minutes and successfully became Class A masters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hiss!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne once again gasped in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the breakthrough of these sixty Class B+ students, all the students at Training Base No. 6 had broken through and became A-level masters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What on earth is happening?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was utterly bewildered. "Is this also because of the Blood Cross?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
