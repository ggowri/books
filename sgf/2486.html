  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne widened his eyes</span><span>.</span><span> </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Ms. Alba clearly knows something.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He also felt that this Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel was different from before. </span><span>T</span><span>wo glaring inconsistencies reinforced his hunch.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The first </span><span>was</span><span> the rules of the state duel and zone duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A significant portion of these competitions wasn't about pure strength; rather, they emphasized treasure-hunting abilities. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was e</span><span>specially </span><span>true for</span><span> the zone duel, </span><span>which</span><span> require</span><span>d</span><span> contestants to </span><span>directly </span><span>participate in a treasure hunt.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There </span><span>wa</span><span>s little direct confrontation between contestants. Therefore, the ones who st</span><span>oo</span><span>d out may not necessarily be the strongest. Instead, their ability to find treasures and their luck matter</span><span>ed</span><span> more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, this </span><span>wa</span><span>s obviously not normal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The second </span><span>was</span><span> that the contestants this time are stronger than those in any previous competition.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the end of the state duel, many people were saying that a large number of prodigies emerged in various states. Any one of them could have easily won in previous state duels. However, this time, they found it hard even to make it into the top five, such as Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson from Zephyr State.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They </span><span>had </span><span>fused three powers before reaching Empyrean Sacredness. In previous state duels, even having one such prodigy was already remarkable. Once they </span><span>attended</span><span>, they would </span><span>claim an effortless victory</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this time, several such prodigies appeared simultaneously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, this </span><span>wa</span><span>s not unique to Zephyr State. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I</span><span>n every region and every state, several prodigies ha</span><span>d</span><span> emerged. It's practically a gathering of prodigies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, in reality, it's not that there </span><span>were</span><span> more prodigies, but that many prodigies were unwilling to participate in previous Glorious Divine Kingdom Duels.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In their view, fighting in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel before reaching Empyrean Sacredness was a waste of time. It's better to focus on quickly improving their cultivation level and becoming a warrior at Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this time, many </span><span>were </span><span>clearly deliberately suppressing their cultivation level. They could have advanced to Empyrean Sacredness long ago but have been holding back just to participate in this Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obviously, the elders of these prodigies ha</span><span>d</span><span> heard some rumors and learned some secrets, which is why they had them suppress their cultivation level to participate in this Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was something hidden within the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne </span><span>had </span><span>previously speculated that the Glorious Divine Kingdom was preparing to explore that place, but he had no evidence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Osborne couldn't help but curiously ask, "Ms. Alba, what </span><span>is the secret behind</span><span> this </span><span>year</span><span>'</span><span>s </span><span>Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana smiled and said, "I can't explain </span><span>everything</span><span> right now. I can only tell you that in the next six months, </span><span>do</span><span> not raise your cultivation level. Even if you can advance to Empyrean Sacredness, you must not do so."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At the very least, you must wait until the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel is over."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Because after the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel ends, every</span><span> participant</span><span> will go to a mysterious place. This place is the greatest secret of the Glorious Divine Kingdom."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't know exactly where this place is. I </span><span>do</span><span> know it's very dangerous and holds countless benefits and opportunities. By then, not only will you enter that place, but I will too. In fact, all the supreme warriors of the Glorious Divine Kingdom will go in."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, only warriors below Empyrean Sacredness can enter the core area of that place. So, before going there, you must not </span><span>advance</span><span> your cultivation level. Otherwise, you'll miss the chance to enter."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing Adriana's words, Osborne looked extremely serious. He was now almost certain that the Glorious Divine Kingdom was about to explore that place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned deeply</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Glorious Divine Emperor, it seems you can't wait any longer. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, that place </span><span>wad</span><span> extremely dangerous. </span><span>He was</span><span> actually sending all the supreme warriors of the Glorious Divine Kingdom there. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Aren</span><span style="font-style: italic;">'t you afraid they might never return? </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Are you willing to risk</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> the foundation of the Glorious Divine Kingdom?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew that place, even better than Adriana</span><span> did</span><span>. After all, in his previous life, Osborne was a prince of the Glorious Divine Kingdom. Although he was just a despised and forgotten prince, he still knew many secrets of the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had heard of the mysterious place Adriana mentioned and knew it was called Necropolis City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Royal Family's</span><span> a</span><span>rchives contain</span><span>ed</span><span> records about Necropolis City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many years ago, Racial Convergence Planet was ruled by the Overpowering Dynasty. The rulers of the Overpowering Dynasty were extremely powerful and cruel, treating the beings on Racial Convergence Planet like slaves. All creatures on Racial Convergence Planet </span><span>suffered under their reign</span><span>, and the planet was like hell.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, Racial Convergence Planet was even called Dark Planet, a world shrouded in darkness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one could </span><span>oppose</span><span> the rulers of the Overpowering Dynasty until one moment when twelve supreme warriors suddenly appeared on Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were called the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet together launched a rebellion against the Overpowering Dynasty. In the end, with their immense power, they killed the rulers of the Overpowering Dynasty and destroyed the dynasty.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet, three belonged to the Human Community, one of whom was Solomon, the founder of the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Records about Necropolis City were also found in the materials left by Solomon.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The reason the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet were so powerful was because of Necropolis City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before entering Necropolis City, the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet were not considered supreme warriors. They obtained some kind of power </span><span>i</span><span>n Necropolis City, which greatly enhanced their strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Solomon did not mention the specific details.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He only warned the descendants of the Glorious Divine Kingdom in the materials he left behind</span><span>.</span><span> Never step into Necropolis City unless the kingdom faces annihilation</span><span>.</span><span> Necropolis City </span><span>wa</span><span>s extremely dangerous, especially </span><span>the</span><span> certain core area within it. Only those below Empyrean Sacredness c</span><span>ould</span><span> enter there; anyone </span><span>else </span><span>who enter</span><span>ed</span><span> w</span><span>ould</span><span> surely die.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, such warnings from Solomon could not stop his descendants.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the following years, Solomon's successors kept trying to enter Necropolis City, hoping to gain power from it and become as strong as Solomon.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in the end, their fates were all tragic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Almost no one could gain immense power from Necropolis City, but countless people died because of it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those who returned alive from Necropolis City could obtain some valuable resources and treasures. </span><span>After</span><span> multiple explorations, the Glorious Divine Kingdom gradually learned more about Necropolis City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eventually, the Glorious Divine Kingdom discovered that every ten thousand years, the deadly Spirit-Entombing Fragrance in Necropolis City would thin out, the strange creatures inside would</span><span> become less, </span><span>and </span><span>it would become much less dangerous</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this time, Necropolis City </span><span>would be</span><span> at its calmest and safest, making it the best opportunity to explore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obviously, this </span><span>opportunity had arrived</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's father in his previous life, Frederick, the Glorious Divine Emperor, was already at the peak of Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was just a step away from advancing his strength to become a true warrior at the Imperial Empyrean Sacredness level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, this step was too difficult.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick found it hard to become a warrior at the Imperial Empyrean Sacredness level. Even at the end of his life, he might not succeed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So now, Frederick couldn't wait any longer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't wait another ten thousand years. He had to go all out, </span><span>taking the advantage</span><span> to fully explore it and gain power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick wanted to reach Imperial Empyrean Sacredness!</span></p><div class="pagination">
