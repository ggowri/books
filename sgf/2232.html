  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela was a nervous wreck. There was a hint of worry in her eyes as she nervously awaited Anastasia's answer. She was deathly afraid that Anastasia would reject her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, Angela had sent everyone else away. If anyone had seen her like this, they'd have been floored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The normally cool and distant Angela was now looking at Anastasia with desperate longing, praying that Anastasia would say yes to being her disciple. It was a sight that no one could have ever predicted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia looked over at Osborne, seeking his advice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, he gave her an encouraging nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd been egging Anastasia on to show off her strength and potential for just this moment, knowing that having Angela as her mentor would be a game-changer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela was a real heavy-hitter, even among the Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her as Anastasia's teacher, Anastasia wouldn't just gain a powerful ally; her cultivation journey would also be a whole lot easier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Osborne could only provide her with resources.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When it came to the ins and outs of cultivation, he was stumped. He'd never reached Empyrean Sacredness in this life or the last, and he had no clue how to guide Anastasia on her path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure thing. Given Anastasia's natural talent, she might eventually manage to break into the Empyrean Sacredness realm all by herself and maybe even stand out among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that road would be full of needless detours and a whole lot of wasted time. Often, those insights that took her hours to figure out could be explained in a jiffy by a seasoned mentor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia was still a youngling. The fewer wrong turns she took, the quicker she could climb the cultivation ladder and set herself up for a brighter future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, getting her an Empyrean Sacredness mentor was a must-do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it wasn't just about Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was hoping that Angela wouldn't just take Anastasia under her wing but also give some TLC to Zoe, Kendra, and the others, guiding them along the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, Osborne said, "Ms. Olsen, hang on a sec! Why don't you check out the rest of our crew before you make up your mind? I reckon Zoe, Kendra, and Bryce have got a ton of potential! Maybe this time, you could think about taking on a few more disciples..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela paused, surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly realized that among everyone present, Osborne was the one calling the shots, and everyone was following his lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she felt his suggestion was a bit presumptuous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The bar's set pretty high for my personal disciples. Finding Anastasia was like winning the lottery. There's no way someone else here can make me go "Whoa".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">You telling me someone can take down a Wooden Golem three cultivation levels above their own, just like Anastasia did? No way I'm buying that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she still gave a nod. "Okay! I'll give it another shot. But listen up, my requirements for personal disciples are no joke! And I </span><span>ain't</span><span> looking to take on a whole </span><span>bunch. Before I met Anastasia, if they could beat a Wooden Golem two levels above theirs, I'd take them on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now... they </span><span>gotta</span><span> beat a Wooden Golem at least three levels above theirs to get me interested!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela figured her conditions would put Osborne off, but all he did was flash a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he turned to Zoe. "Zoe, you're first up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe nodded, her eyes ablaze with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gutsy move!" Angela remarked, waving her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the Wooden Golem's cultivation level settled at Ascension Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe took a deep breath, and a fire of resolve sparked in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get this show on the road!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deafening bang, the battle kicked off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's ace in the hole was her soul-based attacks, but when going up against the soulless Wooden Golem, her skills seemed to hit a wall. Add to that the Golem's cultivation level at Ascension Six, and right from the get-go, she was on the back foot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela watched the unfolding scene and couldn't help but shake her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's performance had already caught her eye. In the past, she would've been over the moon and itching to take Zoe on as a private disciple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with Anastasia setting such a high standard, Zoe seemed to fade into the background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was more, Angela was well aware that her time and energy were limited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking on too many disciples would only cramp her style when it came to teaching them properly, and in the end, it'd be a raw deal for Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as the fight wore on, Angela's expression started to change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her amazement, Zoe didn't go down in defeat against the Ascension Six Wooden Golem. Instead, after sizing up its strength, she slowly but surely started to turn the tables.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Zoe came out on top, having knocked out the Golem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela couldn't hold back a gasp, her heart pounding. Another prodigy who could leap three cultivation levels and take down her Golem!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the surprises just kept on coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila, Kendra, Bryce, Diana, and Hannah all took their turns. Even though each of them took a different amount of time, they too managed to defeat the Ascension Six Wooden Golem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this point, Angela was completely </span><span>gobsmacked</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at the seven of them, her eyes a blend of admiration and inner turmoil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their talent was out of this world!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the old days, just one of them would have made Angela's pulse race, and she'd have been all over the chance to take them under her wing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then again, her time and energy were in short supply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way she could promise to mentor seven disciples effectively&mdash;five, or even four, would be pushing it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Angela could take all seven on, but she knew that'd mean she couldn't give them the guidance they truly needed. That'd be a total waste of their potential, and she couldn't afford to be that reckless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bittersweet feeling of elation washed over Angela.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that running into so many gifted folks all at once made the decision-making process a real pain in the neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Olsen, what's your take on this?" Osborne asked, a smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela didn't answer right away. Instead, she shifted her gaze to Clarissa, Emma, Austin, Anita, and Isa. "How about you guys? Up for a try?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Osborne could jump in, Clarissa and the others shook their heads. "No thanks. There's no way we can go up against a Wooden Golem three cultivation levels above us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela couldn't help but let out a little laugh at their reply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As an Empyrean Sacredness warrior, she could easily tell their cultivation levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa, Emma, Austin, and Anita had all reached Ascension Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three levels higher than that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That meant going up against an Empyrean Sacredness Golem!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was zero chance they could pull that off. If they could, Angela wouldn't even be thinking about taking on disciples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But seeing that they weren't keen on becoming her students, she didn't push it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, Angela turned her attention to Anastasia and the rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, she gritted her teeth and announced, "You seven are something else! Seriously! I can't believe you're all from a small life-bearing planet! In the whole Mystic Sirius Sect... </span><span>no</span><span>, in the entire Tempest Fortress City, there are probably only a few with talent that can hold a candle to yours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'd love to take you all on as my personal disciples and pass on everything I've learned in my life! But unfortunately, I don't have the time or energy to guide all of you properly. Trying to take you all on would just squander your potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I'll only take..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
