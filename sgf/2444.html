  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and said, "Then you need to hurry. If the Magma Devourer returns to its lair, we'll be in trouble."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial didn't reply, just nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He can steal memories from other World Tree offshoots. Among them, one offshoot's memory contains a way to deal with the Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Primordial was using this method for the first time, so he wasn't very skilled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He needed to calculate the positions of all the silicon-based neural nodes in the Magma Devourer's body to identify a few key ones that were crucial yet located just on the surface.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those silicon-based neural nodes are the Magma Devourer's fatal weakness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as they can destroy those silicon-based neural nodes, the Magma Devourer will immediately lose its power or even die outright.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, this is not just the Magma Devourer's weakness but the weakness of all silicon-based lifeforms.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After mastering this method, Osborne can calculate the weakness of any silicon-based lifeform he encounters in the future and focus his attacks on those weak points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This way, he will be able to kill them more easily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne decided to learn this method from Primordial after returning. Although silicon-based lifeforms are rare, no one can guarantee he won't encounter them in the future.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every silicon-based lifeform has terrifying defense and immense vitality. Under normal circumstances, they are extremely hard to kill. If he masters this method, it will become much easier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, it's too late to learn this method temporarily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne can only hope that Primordial quickly identifies the Magma Devourer's weakness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Flash, let's not get too close to it. Don't rush to provoke it. When I make my move, you'll have your chance to fight," Osborne reassured the eager-to-battle Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash could only obediently slow down and follow behind the Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Primordial, are you ready?" After a while, Osborne couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the Magma Devourer had already ventured deep into the volcanic region, getting closer and closer to its nest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt very anxious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial replied, "Don't rush me. Almost! Give me ten more minutes."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ten minutes?" Osborne rolled his eyes. "At Magma Devourer's speed, ten minutes is enough for it to return to its nest. The environment there is perfect for Magma Devourer to fight. If that happens, killing it will become much harder."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then don't let the Magma Devourer go back," Primordial said quickly. "Find a way to provoke it, make it chase us, and stall for ten minutes."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Primordial's words, Osborne rolled his eyes again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne knew that Primordial had done his best. Now, he could only follow Primordial's words and find a way to provoke Magma Devourer, making it give up returning to its nest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What should I do?" Osborne looked at Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash also looked at Osborne, eyes full of excitement. Osborne instantly understood what Flash meant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said in surprise, "Flash, are you saying you can stall Magma Devourer, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash nodded vigorously, eyes full of anticipation, as if waiting for Osborne to order it to attack Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne frowned deeply, thinking, "Flash is indeed very strong, but it's only at primary Empyrean Sacredness and still in its juvenile stage. Although Magma Devourer isn't fully grown either, it's already at advanced Empyrean Sacredness, almost nearing Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Can Flash really stall Magma Devourer? With such a huge gap in their cultivation levels, won't Flash get crushed to death by Magma Devourer in one stomp?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was still hesitating, but Magma Devourer was already quickly approaching its nest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Knowing he couldn't hesitate any longer, Osborne gritted his teeth and said, "Alright. You'll go into battle."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But don't engage it head-on. It's best to provoke it and then toy with it using your speed. We just need to hold it off for ten minutes."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Flash nodded excitedly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne used his strength to support Clara and Leroy, then left Flash's back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Flash dashed out wildly, as fast as lightning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Flash let out an incredibly excited roar, instantly appearing in front of the massive Magma Devourer, staring excitedly into its eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, the Magma Devourer was enraged.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To it, Flash was just a tiny ant. But Flash not only dared to provoke it but also had the audacity to block its way. Magma Devourer thought Flash was courting death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the Magma Devourer began its attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It spewed high-density energy particles, like magma, from its massive mouth, instantly engulfing Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Watch out! Dodge quickly!" Seeing this, Osborne hurriedly warned Flash to get out of the way. With Flash's speed, it could easily dodge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, this time Flash didn&rsquo;t use its speed to dodge. Facing the scorching magma particles spewed by Magma Devourer, Flash's eyes were filled with excitement. At that moment, the color of Flash's head changed from blood red to icy blue.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Flash unleashed a Dragon's Breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a boom, the icy blue Dragon's Breath instantly surged toward Magma Devourer's fiery red scorching magma.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash is actually confronting Magma Devourer head-on!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne felt extremely tense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy were also very tense. All their eyes were focused on Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, with a boom, Flash's icy blue Dragon's Breath collided with Magma Devourer's scorching magma.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a crack, under everyone's shocked gaze, the scorching magma spewed by Magma Devourer was actually frozen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A terrifying chill spread to Magma Devourer's body, seemingly about to freeze it entirely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, not only Osborne and the other two were shocked, but even Magma Devourer was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But its brain wasn't smart enough to handle complex situations. It only felt its authority was challenged. So, it became even angrier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It suddenly raised its massive forelimb and slammed it fiercely toward Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To Flash, Magma Devourer's forelimb seemed like a massive mountain crashing down. Yet, Flash still didn't back down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash's gaze was wild and domineering. At this moment, Flash's head quickly changed color, turning silver.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, amidst the roar, Flash's silver head unleashed Dragon's Breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The silver Dragon's Breath possessed an extremely terrifying melting effect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the silver Dragon's Breath unleashed by Flash engulfed Magma Devourer's forelimb. Then, its forelimb was actually melted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The intense pain made Magma Devourer let out a roar. Instead of retreating, it slammed its massive forelimb toward Flash even faster.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Flash could no longer dodge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Watch out!" Osborne shouted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Magma Devourer's massive forelimb slammed into Flash. Instantly, a large amount of blood spurted from Flash's body, and he was sent flying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne even heard the sound of Flash's bones breaking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes were filled with worry as he prepared to rush over to check on Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that moment, an angry roar erupted. Flash charged back again. However, Flash was no longer in the form of a warhorse but had returned to its true form.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash's true form stood 328 feet tall, with three heads, six pairs of wings, sharp teeth, and claws, looking incredibly menacing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Flash flapped its wings and lunged at Magma Devourer with terrifying speed.</span></p><div class="pagination">
