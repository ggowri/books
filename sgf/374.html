  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad wasn't lying. This time, his strength had increased by at least thirty percent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Spiral Force had also become more penetrating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after Osborne transformed into a Vampire, his strength increased even more. The highly penetrative Spiral Force could no longer inflict significant damage on his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was because Brad's Spiral Force was far inferior to Isa's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were like two cannonballs colliding. A tremendous noise erupted, and someone was violently blasted away, carving a massive trench across the ocean's surface, stretching several hundred yards before finally coming to a stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac and Lauren, who were watching the battle, were both shocked and incredulous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The one that was blasted away was Brad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy. He wasn't bragging. He said he had a sixty percent chance of killing Brad, and it seems to be true. He actually blasted Brad away in a head-on clash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Class A martial master's strength is all about power and technique. It seems Brad's combat skills didn't give him an advantage, and his strength is weaker than Osborne's."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac's breathing became a bit rapid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep in his eyes, a hint of regret flashed. He regretted that Osborne wasn't truly a member of the Augustine family, but only temporarily with them to help the Augustine family through their crisis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne would eventually leave the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If only he were one of the Augustine family. I would go all out to support him, to make him the head of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With him, the Augustine family could flourish for a hundred years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking this, Isaac continued watching the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After blasting Brad away, Osborne finally felt confident. His physical strength was indeed no less than that of a Class A martial master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While his combat skills were not as refined as Brad's, after being tormented and guided by Isa, he at least wasn't afraid of Brad anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "If that is the case...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then kill him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intensity of the battle here was extreme, likely to attract onlookers. He needed to kill Brad as quickly as possible and then leave immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly chased after Brad, not giving him a chance to catch his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fierce melee erupted on the surface of the sea, like two agile tyrannosaurs recklessly unleashing power beyond human limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each punch was like a cannonball firing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each kick seemed capable of kicking a hole in the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of their fight, huge waves surged across the ocean, rippling in all directions. Their bodies seemed like two epicenters of an earthquake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kind of battle was incredibly exhilarating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for the two fighting, the situation was entirely different. Osborne felt more confident and exhilarated with each strike, while Brad felt extremely frustrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had fully unleashed the power of a Class A martial master but still couldn't withstand Osborne's attacks. Osborne's strength was actually greater than his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He struck with a Spiral Force, but it was as if he was trapped in a mire, unable to harm Osborne at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in terms of speed, Osborne was faster than him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This situation left Brad feeling both frustrated and shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's not even a Class A martial master yet. His body hasn't formed the martial art aura. So why does he have such incredible strength? Why is his body so powerful?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His defense is even more formidable than mine, and I have the martial art aura."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad roared furiously in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint glow surrounded his body. This was the martial art aura, formed by the energy and blood after breaking through to Class A martial master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The martial art aura was the hallmark of a Class A martial master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though it seemed inconspicuous, it was extremely powerful, especially in defense, stronger than any steel armor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to this martial art aura, Brad could stand still and withstand attacks from Class B+ martial artists or even Class B+ metahumans. They wouldn't be able to harm him at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until today, Brad had been proud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't consider anyone below Class A master worth his attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, that pride was gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't a Class A master. The blood-colored light around him wasn't the martial art aura, yet it was stronger than Brad's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne's attacks grew fiercer, Brad gradually couldn't hold on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His martial art aura was constantly shattered by Osborne, now tattered and failing. Osborne's immense strength pierced through the martial art aura, striking his body and making him cough up blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was relentlessly pushed back, completely overpowered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The worst part was that Brad knew Osborne was also a metahuman with powerful power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, Osborne hadn't used any of his powers against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What does he want?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is he just using me as a test? Does he want to defeat me with sheer physical strength alone? Damn it. Damn it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad was filled with anger but even more with despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "If Osborne could suppress me this badly without using his powers, what would happen if he did? Would I really die here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Brad was terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After being sent flying by Osborne again, Brad didn't continue to resist. He turned and fled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad ran away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far away, Lauren, who had been watching, was horrified to see Osborne force Brad to flee. Without hesitation, she threw the unconscious Yohan into the sea and began to run for her life.</span></p><div class="pagination">
