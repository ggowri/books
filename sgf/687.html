  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne confirmed once again that there were no enemies in the entire mining area </span><span>before he began to clean up the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He began to gather the blood and energy on the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this period, the Blood Cross absorbed a large amount of blood and energy, becoming more and more powerful. Osborne felt that it seemed to be awakening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this was a good thing for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A large amount of blood power couldn't not only enhance the power of the Blood Cross, allowing him to gain more power when he transformed into a vampire, but the released power could also make Osborne's body stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's soul of powers had long been integrated with his body, which meant that the stronger his body was, the stronger his supernatural powers would become.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, collecting a large amount of blood energy would bring him countless benefits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After doing all this, Osborne looked at the two Marquis Titans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were not as huge as the Duke Titan but still more than 16 feet long. Even if their limbs were broken by Osborne, they still looked like a mountain of flesh when lying on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked very small standing next to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked at Osborne with hatred in their eyes. One of them even detonated the power of his body, blowing his body into pieces. He was trying to commit suicide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that he knew that if he didn't commit suicide, he would have to endure Osborne's crazy torture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, his plan failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His physical injuries recovered quickly under Clarissa's divine healing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at him with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just a clone, but you're afraid of being tortured? You even want to commit suicide? Since you're afraid of being tortured, things will be easy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered and walked up to the other person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, he began to torture the Marquis Titan with various methods. With Clarissa by his side, he was not worried that the Marquis Titan would die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time his body was tortured beyond recognition by Osborne, Clarissa would perform divine healing and save him from the brink of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he had to continue to endure the torture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under such circumstances, the Marquis Titan quickly collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I say! I'll tell you whatever you want to know!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just ask you to give me a quick death and stop torturing me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Marquis Titan burst into tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "Your willpower seemed not as strong as your body! I still have many ways to torture you, and you surrender?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In that case, I will let you go for now! But if your next answer does not satisfy me, or if I find you are lying, I promise to make you regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Osborne began to ask questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me, what are you digging for in this mine? What is your real purpose?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Marquis Titan looked horrified, and a look of struggle appeared when he heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We... We just want the rare metals here. Various rare metals, such as lithium, beryllium, tantalum, niobium."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered when he heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that you are not honest at all. Do you dare to lie to me? If so, then you can continue to endure the torture!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Osborne was ready to continue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! I'm not lying! Everything I said is true! Let me go and don't torture me anymore. Everything I said is true."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Marquis Titan pleaded loudly, extremely terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Osborne was not merciful at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed at Clarissa and said, "You may not know, but my girlfriend has the power, to discern lies! She can tell at a glance whether you are lying or not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, was he telling the truth just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa shook her head, "He lied!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded and sneered at the Marquis Titan, "Since you are not honest, continue to endure the torture!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, he ignited the flames and set the Marquis Titan's body on fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The burning sensation made the Marquis Titan scream miserably and roll around on the ground madly, but he couldn't put out the flames on his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at the other Marquis Titan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled faintly and said, "Now, let me ask you a question. You'd better not lie! Otherwise, I guarantee that you will suffer endless torture like him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Marquis Titan looked horrified and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I say!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our real goal is not those ordinary rare metals. Our goal is something called Originium! This Originium currently only exists in a few provinces along the coast of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our mission is to dig up as much Originium as possible in the shortest possible time, and then bring it back to the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, Osborne looked at Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa nodded, " Osborne, he didn't lie!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No lies?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned. Since the Marquis Titan did not lie, their real purpose was the Originium.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What is Originium?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's the use?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had never heard of it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought for a moment and said, "Where is the Originium? Take me to see it!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
