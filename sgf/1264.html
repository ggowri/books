  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia declared with a determined tone, "When more of us break through to godhood, the Deschanel Clan won't scare us anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I may not know everything, but in the Draco Armed Services Branch I've taken charge of, over a thousand members have reached the peak of Class S and have begun refining Divine Bone and Divine Flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It won't be long before they all ascend! We just need to buy some time, and the tables will turn in our favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, Osborne's Blood Demon unit is still with us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't gauge their current strength, but they surely aren't lagging behind the Draco Armed Services Branch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Soon enough, they, too, will be god-level warriors. Only then will we truly stand fearless against the Deschanel Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words were met with a nod of agreement from everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon members had been secluded on the second level of the bastion, inaccessible even to the Augustine family leaders, so no one knew their precise strength at this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian made his decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then it's settled. We defend. Our edge is that the Deschanel Clan doesn't know our true strength, so they won't send too many warriors to attack us outright. We must keep our full power under wraps and reveal it gradually..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He laid out his plan meticulously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst the ensuing discussion, a final strategy was agreed upon: defend and delay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Delay until more of their people became gods and until Osborne concluded his seclusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the strategy set, Sebastian personally led fifty newly ascended Augustine family warriors out of the bastion and back to the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he looked at the nine peaks of the Augustine Estate, which were now nearly </span><span>swallowed by rampant plant growth from neglect, he couldn't help but sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's unbelievable how quickly the world has changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There was a time when having just one Class S warrior could position a group as a superpower, with a life of luxury and little threat. Now, superpowers have armfuls of Class S warriors with gods among them; their strength multiplied a hundred, even a thousand times!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yet still, survival is a struggle. We face relentless Beast Tide attacks, the threat of Dark Deities, and now the Deschanel Clan pressing us to submit..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaking his head as he muttered to himself, Sebastian's expression hardened suddenly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned sharply, activating Satan's Eye, causing seven white stars to shimmer in his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Satan's Eye had advanced to Level Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're here! A Superior Deity!" he announced in a hushed tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group behind him immediately tensed. They were facing a true Superior Deity, a prospect daunting to even the god-ascended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How powerful could a Superior Deity be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Were they truly prepared to face such a challenge?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None among them had experience with such power, but they were resolved not to yield nor bow down. Their only option was to stand against the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hide yourselves first!" Sebastian commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the fifty warriors found places to conceal themselves, preparing for the inevitable clash with resolve and caution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, a towering and muscular figure appeared in the sky above the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was calm, yet his eyes carried an air of arrogance and confidence, instantly locking onto Sebastian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man was none other than Joseph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph had spent two days dealing with the other four superpowers; one had chosen to resist him and was annihilated with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining three had meekly chosen to submit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything had been proceeding smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason he took two days to arrive at the Augustine Estate was largely due to locating these superpowers' hidden positions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with only one day left of the three-day deadline, Joseph felt no rush. Once the Augustine family was dealt with, all superpowers within </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> would be under his control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of the twenty-five superpowers in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, aside from the Augustine family, all had either been destroyed or had surrendered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family was the last holdout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph didn't believe the Augustine family posed any real threat to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fixing his gaze on Sebastian and the nine newly ascended Junior Deities behind him, Joseph allowed a smug grin to spread across his face. "It seems you were waiting for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian snorted, slowly rising into the air to meet Joseph. "Indeed, we were </span><span>waiting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph scoffed, saying, "So, you've managed to have ten of you ascend to godhood. Impressive, but a handful of deities can't defy the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Surrender peacefully; submit to the Deschanel Clan, and you'll live. Resist, and it's the end of the line for you! Achieving godhood is no easy feat; don't make me wipe you all out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm a Superior Deity with a Level Three Divine Body, not someone you can contend with..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph paused abruptly, his eyes widening in shock as he noticed something above Sebastian's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously dismissive of Sebastian, he hadn't bothered to scrutinize his Divine Flame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now staring at Sebastian's Divine Flame, Joseph was astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A cyan Divine Flame! You have a Level Five Divine Body?!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
