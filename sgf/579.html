  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can I say a few words to my family before we go?" Osborne asked coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew, slightly disappointed by Osborne's lack of resistance, shrugged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got three minutes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne walked over to Isaac.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He discreetly removed the Draco Star Wristlet from his wrist and handed it to Isaac.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isaac," Osborne said softly, "don't worry about me. As the heir apparent, they won't do anything too severe. They just want to make things uncomfortable for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be out soon. I'm more worried about what might happen to you all while I'm away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take this. If something goes wrong, contact Serena and use this as a token to get her help. Even though she's not a direct family member, she has a lot of influence in the Augustine family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac took Draco Star Wristlet and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be careful. I don't know what the dungeon is like, but it seems like everyone in the Augustine family is afraid of it. Stay safe, and we'll be waiting for your return."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded and turned to Kendra. "Kendra, I know you're more capable than you let on. While I'm gone, make sure Zoe, Anastasia, and Yulissa are safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have to promise me they'll be okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra pouted with a frown. "Osborne, what are you talking about? I don't have any offensive abilities. How am I supposed to protect them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's gaze remained steady, clearly serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, alright, I promise. If it comes to that, I'll get my brother to help. I'm not much on my own, but I'll do what I can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne relaxed, feeling reassured by her promise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time's up!" Matthew called out sharply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, it's time to go to the dungeon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave him a brief, dismissive glance, then addressed the crowd watching them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were cold as he took in their sneers and derision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"While I'm away, anyone who dares to target the Augustine family in Dampston will become my enemy. Unless I'm dead, I will make sure to get my revenge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fierce determination radiated from Osborne, making the crowd uneasy and their expressions tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! You're the one who should worry about getting out of the dungeon first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And who do you think you are, making threats like that? You think you can just come back and get revenge?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Laughable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath but decided not to say more. He knew his threats wouldn't change the minds of those who truly wanted to harm him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words were meant to give him a reason to strike back once he was free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lead the way," Osborne said, his voice as cold as ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew gave a dismissive chuckle and turned to walk ahead. The crowd watched their retreating figures until they were out of sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, head back. I'll handle him from here," Matthew called out once they left Mount Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood!" the onlookers replied, dispersing back to the main bloodline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew guided Osborne towards Challenge Peak, where the Augustine family's dungeon was located.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne followed, deep in thought about why Matthew seemed to have it out for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At thirty-eight, Matthew was a powerful figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd become a metahuman master at twenty-two and was now also a martial master. His skills made him the second most formidable of the younger generation, only behind Vincent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumor had it that he was nearing Class AAA and was significantly stronger than Owen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given his position, Osborne couldn't understand why Matthew would be targeting him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it something to do with Mr. Caleb Augustine's comments?" Osborne mused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're wondering why I'm focusing on you, right?" Matthew's voice cut through his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied coolly, "Yes, I am. I don't remember doing anything to offend you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew shrugged nonchalantly. "Offend me? You're too na&iuml;ve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From the moment you became the heir apparent, you became my competitor. Even if your strength doesn't impress me right now, I always think ahead. As competitors, it's only natural for me to try to outmaneuver you. Don't you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback. "You're quite honest about your intentions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew smiled slightly. "Of course. There's no point in hiding my goals. I've learned from a young age that going all out against rivals is just part of the game. If you can retaliate effectively, I'll respect that and won't hold a grudge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow. "So you're saying I shouldn't hate you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew laughed softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether you hate me or not doesn't matter. I'm confident that, no matter how much you might despise me, you won't be able to change my path. I see potential in you. When I become the head of the Augustine family, I'll need someone like you to help strengthen the family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's face hardened. "You're quite confident. But as far as I know, you're only the second strongest among the younger generation. What makes you think you can become the head of the Augustine family?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
