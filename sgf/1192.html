  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I don't head back soon, Anastasia, Zoe, and the Blood Demon members are going to start worrying," Osborne thought as he made his way outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although his fight with Cain had concluded swiftly, the tremendous power unleashed during the battle had caused the passage to collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The route he had taken was now completely blocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Osborne, this was hardly a challenge. If he wanted to, he could easily blast his way through a new exit without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Osborne possessed earth elemental power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it wasn't his primary ability, and he hadn't used it in a long time, creating a new path wouldn't be a problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, there was an even simpler solution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thought, Osborne's form vanished from the spot, and he found himself traversing the parallel space, moving at an incredible speed toward his destination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Osborne's latest ability&mdash;Phantom Steps!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the main space had no clear path, the parallel space was smooth sailing. Moving within it allowed him to dart about with unmatched swiftness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time at all, Osborne arrived back at the location where he had separated from the Blood Demon Vanguard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What met his eyes was chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Swarming from two other passages were countless Dark Exotic Beasts&mdash;more than a thousand of them. Each one boasted Class S strength, with quite a few being top-tier </span><span>Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, despite their numbers, these beasts were clearly at a disadvantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their opponents were members of the Blood Demon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of them had arrived now, a force of over 48 hundred strong. Apart from about a hundred elite Class S members from the Blood Demon Vanguard, the rest were also Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were well-trained, tightly knit, and impeccably equipped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given these circumstances, it didn't matter that the Dark Exotic Beasts numbered in the thousands; they were swiftly being cut down by the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained unnoticed, hidden within the parallel space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took his time, observing the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are there so many Dark Exotic Beasts here? Beneath the ground, there are three passages, and one of them leads directly to the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. The powerful mental disturbances from the Lotus keep anyone&mdash;including the Dark Exotic Beasts&mdash;at bay except for me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, these beasts must be coming from the other two passages. Should I check it out?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There are simply too many of them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I hadn't stumbled upon this, they could have surged out and caused unimaginable destruction on the surface, wiping out cities and slaughtering innocent people left and right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It looks like there's a Dark Exotic Beast nest down here. Since I've found it, I have to eliminate this nest once and for all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that conclusion, Osborne decided not to wait any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He disengaged Phantom Steps and materialized from the parallel space, reappearing beside Anastasia and Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia and Zoe exclaimed, their faces lighting up with joy at the sight of him. There was no shock&mdash;just happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and nodded at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon members felt an electric thrill at his presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some inexplicable reason, they sensed that Osborne had changed somehow. He stood there, exuding an aura that made him seem like their deity&mdash;the supreme force capable of shaping their destinies!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What they didn't realize was that Osborne had successfully completed the second stage of his fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. He was now, in essence, the true progenitor of the Blood Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And they, every single one of them, were transformed descendants of the Blood Clan, his creations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Osborne now in full control over life and death, the true might of the Blood Clan lineage flowed through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His unchallenged authority over the Blood Demons sent their members forward relentlessly. The Dark Exotic Beasts suffered heavy casualties, yet from two separate passages, even more poured forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle raged on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, something feels different about you," Anastasia and Zoe chimed in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They each clung to one of his arms, their faces a mix of curiosity and concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne merely nodded, smiling, "You're right, I am different now. Because I've ascended to godhood."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Anastasia and Zoe were momentarily stunned before their eyes widened in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you've become a god?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can that be? You were only gone for two days!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their astonishment, their joy was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, ruffling their hair affectionately. "I stumbled upon a stroke of luck."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He considered whether to reveal the existence of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity but decided against it, not out of distrust, but rather because the fewer who knew about it, the better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reach and methods of the divine were beyond comprehension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Merely uttering the name "Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity" might alert those who could sense it, much like how merely invoking Isa's name could summon her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough about that. Let me show you the power I've gained since becoming a god."</span></p><div class="pagination">
