  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy exchanged a glance. Seeing Osborne's firm attitude, determined to chase and kill the Magma Devourer, they were very worried.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isn't this really courting death?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Is Osborne's mind really clear at this moment?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He's just an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King. No matter how strong he is, how could he possibly be a match for the Magma Devourer? This will definitely end badly!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy and Clara were both anxious, but there was nothing they could do.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Both Osborne and Flash were extremely excited at this moment. Leroy and Clara couldn't stop them at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy said, "Forget it. We can't stop him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara agreed, "At least Flash is there. If something goes wrong, Osborne can escape. As long as he doesn't rush toward the Magma Devourer right away, he should be fine."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy and Clara were comforting each other.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne had Flash chase the Magma Devourer while quickly communicating with Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, "Primordial, can your method really work?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even though the Magma Devourer is seriously injured, it can still easily kill me. Don't lie to me. Can I really kill the Magma Devourer?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial calmly said, "Don't worry. We'll be fine. You have Satan's Eye, which can use X-ray vision on the Magma Devourer's body to see all its silicon-based neural nodes. And I happen to know the locations of a few silicon-based neural nodes that are extremely fatal to the Magma Devourer."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, the Magma Devourer is injured, and its strength and reactions have significantly weakened. Although its defense is still terrifying, you have the Warfare Scythe and spatial power."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When the time comes, as soon as I give the order, you immediately get close to it, use the Warfare Scythe to break through its defense, and severely damage the fatal silicon-based neural nodes."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In that case, it will surely die."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Primordial was very confident.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded, choosing to trust Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, that's because of Flash. If Primordial's method doesn't work, Flash can help Osborne hold out for a while and even take him away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash is faster than Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If the situation becomes critical, Osborne can even summon Drum. Although Drum is still in its juvenile stage and cannot assist Osborne in battle, Drum has raised a group of powerful pets.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he releases thousands of Silver Beetles at the Empyrean Sacredness level, even Magma Devourer at its peak would be scared off.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, Osborne has many tricks, and Magma Devourer is a treasure trove.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne obtains its energy core, the Marrow Crystal, and absorbs it, his body can break through to the advanced Sacredness Level, and even the elemental essence of his fire power will be enhanced.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Additionally, he can feed Magma Devourer's bones to the Warfare Ancient Tree, greatly enhancing it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, with the help of the Warfare Ancient Tree, Osborne's Bloodwrought Bow can break through to become a Mid-grade Sacred Artifact, gaining the power of flames and significantly increasing its strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, in his eyes, the Magma Devourer frantically fleeing ahead was not a terrifying Silicon-based Lifeform but a treasure-filled mountain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was determined to claim this treasure-filled mountain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Flash, we need to go faster. The Magma Devourer wants to return to its lair. I've already emptied the treasures in its lair. If it gets back, it'll definitely become even angrier. Plus, the environment there will make it stronger, recover faster, and harder to deal with."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We must catch up with it quickly and not let it return," Osborne ordered Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon receiving the order, Flash let out a deep dragon roar. Its speed increased by another 30%, like a bolt of lightning, leaving a blood-red afterimage in the void as it quickly closed the distance with the Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, they got very close to the Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Observing the 32,808-feet-tall Magma Devourer up close, Osborne felt an overwhelming sense of oppression, as if facing a towering mountain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No, it was far more terrifying than a mountain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but swallow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Magma Devourer was definitely the most terrifying opponent he had ever faced. If not for Primordial's urging, Osborne would never have taken action against the Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Flash was incredibly excited, even letting out a dragon roar toward the Magma Devourer, full of provocation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the frantically fleeing Magma Devourer turned its massive head and looked over, spotting the tiny Flash and Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A trace of confusion flashed in its massive eyes. Its mind wasn't very sharp, so it couldn't figure out why Flash dared to provoke it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, after realizing it couldn't figure it out, the Magma Devourer stopped thinking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It decided to teach Flash a lesson, to show Flash who truly ruled this planet. No creature could provoke it, not even when it was injured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, the Magma Devourer roared and spewed a stream of magma toward Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a boom, a torrent of magma instantly engulfed Flash, along with Osborne and the other two on his back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, watch out!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get out of the way!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Leroy and Clara turned pale with fear and screamed in terror.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't be afraid," Osborne reassured Leroy and Clara, then patted Flash's head. "Don't provoke it. Our goal is to kill it, not to enrage it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash shook its head. It initially wanted to unleash Dragon's Breath to confront the Magma Devourer head-on. But in an instant, it flapped its wings and chose to dodge instead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sure enough, Flash was too fast. The magma spewed by the Magma Devourer couldn't catch up with Flash and was easily dodged.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Magma Devourer didn't care.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It thought its attack had scared Flash away and felt that was enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, it turned its head and kept charging forward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Quickly use Satan's Eye to locate all the silicon-based neural nodes on its body. I need to pinpoint its fatal weakness based on those silicon-based neural nodes," Primordial said to Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and immediately pushed Satan's Eye to its limit. In his eyes, the massive body of the distant Magma Devourer gradually became transparent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everything inside its body appeared in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit amazed</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Silicon-based lifeforms are indeed different from carbon-based lifeforms. Its body has no organs resembling internal structures, only many massive spiral formations like nuclear reactors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These spiral structures generate incredibly terrifying power and serve as the energy drive system of the Magma Devourer. However, these are clearly not silicon-based neural nodes. The so-called silicon-based neural nodes are used to connect these energy drive systems.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only those silicon-based neural nodes connect these energy drive systems, allowing the Magma Devourer to move freely and unleash such terrifying power."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne suddenly became excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He saw a silicon-based neural node. In his Satan's Eye, that silicon-based neural node was like a star shimmering with light.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Within the massive body of the Magma Devourer, there are hundreds of such silicon-based neural nodes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly locked onto all the silicon-based neural nodes and then relayed their positions to Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Give me a moment," Primordial said quickly. "I can soon figure out which silicon-based neural node is the most fatal to it."</span></p><div class="pagination">
