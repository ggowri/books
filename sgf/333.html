  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and others looked at Kendra in surprise, speculating if she was lying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Kendra's expression was serious, and she didn't seem to be joking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe she was indeed Bryce's sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it was true, she would become the noblest person they had met. The Likreia Mountain Pirates were said to have 8,000 elite soldiers who could even compete with the Rosmandi fleet and were not afraid of being besieged by many countries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ancient families like the Augustine family even dare not offend them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the leader of pirates of the Likreia Mountain, Bryce was the undoubted overlord of this sea, and his sister would only be much superior than the heir of an ancient family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why was Kendra so weak?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Bryce's sister, Kendra was actually captured by another group of pirates and almost raped. It was the most hilarious joke Osborne had ever heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he still didn't quite believe her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He really wanted to give Kendra a truth serum to see if she was lying or not. Unfortunately, the last truth serum he bought had been fed to Xavier. Even if he went to buy one now, it would take a lot of time for the pill to be delivered to him across the vast ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, truth serum had side effects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was also unwilling to use the truth serum on innocent people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it. No matter if she's lying or not, let's keep her for now. If she's not Bryce's sister, we can just send her away when we get back. If what she said is true, Bryce will owe me a favor. Perhaps, it will be of great use in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking for a while, Osborne nodded and said, "You can follow us for now. Contact your brother as soon as possible and ask him to pick you up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Kendra immediately seemed delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nodded in joy. "Okay. Osborne, you are a good person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waved his hand and handed her to Yulissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go, we should go back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he stirred up a strong wind, which swept the four of them up into the air and returned to the Alisa Ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!!" Kendra was blown into the air by the strong wind, looking extremely excited. She looked at Osborne with admiration and kept shouting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne saw this out of the corner of his eye and couldn't help but shake his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her behavior made him firmly believe that Kendra was lying because there was nothing worth being excited about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce's power was at least equal to a master's, and flying was a piece of cake for him. If Kendra was Bryce's sister, she would not make such a fuss like now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided to find an opportunity to send her back to where she really belonged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking about it, Osborne calmly controlled the strong wind, and the five of them quickly returned to the 15th floor deck of the Alisa Ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, get her a room, and everyone, go back to rest." Osborne dismissed everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Returning to his room, Osborne held the blood diamonds and thought while improving his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hydrophis Belcheri Organization was just a very small pirate force. They didn't plot the attack on the Augustine family. Compared to the mastermind, they were just some disposable nobodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even more, they were not the only ones hired to attack the cruise ship of the Augustine family because Hydrophis Belcheri Organization only launched four attacks in total, while the Augustine family suffered far more than four attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "It seems that the surrounding pirate organizations were hired by the person behind the vile, so the Augustine family was targeted so badly and suffered such heavy losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is the mastermind behind this the Ghost Ship?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe there's also someone else manipulating it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sorted out the information he had obtained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family must have offended someone, or its existence had infringed on other people's interests. So, they wanted to eliminate the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the mastermind was able to command the mysterious organization Ghost Ship to target the Augustine family. This person was most likely the force behind Ghost Ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ghost Ship was just a sharp knife for this person to get rid of his or her competitors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whenever the Augustine family's cruise ship started sailing, Blueblood of the Ghost Ship would hire ordinary pirates from the surrounding area to attack the ship, causing the Augustine family to suffer heavy losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the top leaders of the Augustine family felt like investigating what was happening, they struck in person. After the Ghost Ship got the intelligence of the leader, they would assassinate him or her immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was probably how the head of the family, Allen, died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will the Ghost Ship hunt me? I am now the heir of the Augustine family and am kind of a significant person. If they kill me, it will be a huge blow to the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, the Ghost Ship may attack in any minute from now on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There is a rat in the Augustine family who has leaked my whereabouts, so as the information that two Class A- metahuman from The Wise Order will protect me in secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That means, if they decide to strike, I'll encounter a terrible battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two Class A- elders can't compete with them at all. However, I'm merely capable of fighting with them now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne became a little anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this period, whenever he had free time, he used blood diamonds to improve his power and physical fitness. His strength was improving by leaps and bounds every day, but until now, he had not yet broken through to become a Class B+ metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The extra energy in his body was now as high as 325 feet, which was so close to getting the breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The soul of powers of a Class B+ metahuman only had 33 feet, and even the most </span><span>gifted genius got the breakthrough of Class B+, the soul of powers would only reach 98 feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's power had far exceeded the normal range.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt that as long as his power exceeded one hundred yards, he would undergo a transformation and be promoted to Class B+.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this was coming soon!</span></p><div class="pagination">
