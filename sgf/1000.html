  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but feel a surge of satisfaction as he assessed the defensive capabilities of his martial art aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had previously tested it with the Goddess of Grain's Scythe, he needed this moment to truly confirm its strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blocking the full-force attacks of two Class S assassins from the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization solidified his belief: his martial art aura had genuinely transformed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both his offensive and defensive capabilities had reached terrifying new heights&mdash;far surpassing the Class AAA level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, many Class S warriors wouldn't possess such formidable power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smirk crept onto Osborne's face as he locked eyes with the two </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> assassins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you can't kill me, I guess it's my turn! Now, go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Osborne made his move. Within his Light Realm, the two assassins had nowhere to run.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could only engage him head-on, but their attacks and defenses paled in comparison to Osborne's. Without the advantage of their Stealth Art, their fate was sealed&mdash;death awaited them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce burst of energy, Osborne unleashed the full might of his martial art aura, obliterating the two Class S assassins in mere seconds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, every last assassin from the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization lay dead at his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Lambert family members watched in awe, their admiration for Osborne palpable as they collectively released a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne knew better than to let his guard down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, we need to get out of here&mdash;now! These guys were just the advance team."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The real threats are Sin and Crimson, the </span><span>top Class</span><span> S fighters!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have to leave immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Osborne began to absorb the residual blood energy in the area, storing it </span><span>within the Blood Cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than ten minutes, over a hundred Class AAA </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> assassins and three Class S assassins had died here, leaving behind an overwhelming concentration of blood energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Osborne prepared to lead the Lambert family away, a chilling voice sliced through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think you can leave?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could react, a terrifying attack erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Light Realm Osborne had yet to retract trembled violently, shattering like glass and vanishing into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The backlash from the mental strength strain hit Osborne hard, causing him to spit out a mouthful of blood, his face paling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked up, anxiety gripping him as he spotted two furious figures rapidly approaching from about five hundred yards away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attack that had shattered his Realm had come from the male figure&mdash;Sin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin and Crimson were here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wiping the blood from his lips, Osborne wore a grave face. He knew there was no chance of escaping now. Sin and Crimson were top-tier Class S fighters, even stronger than the likes of Gerardo and Sebastian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a couple of breaths, the two were within striking distance, less than a hundred yards away from them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leave? Not a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with his spatial power, there was no way he could pull off interdimensional travel in front of these two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fighting was his only option.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Osborne sensed a hint of disarray in Sin and Crimson's energy. They were clearly injured and not at their peak strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Osborne's chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at Greyson and Roy, who looked pale and terrified. But when they met his gaze, they steeled themselves, determination replacing fear. They knew they had to stand with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the presence of Sin and Crimson, anyone below Class S was utterly powerless. Even the residual shockwaves from their battle could spell death for the unprepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greyson and Roy, though trembling with fear, stepped forward, ready to confront the two Class S powerhouses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin and Crimson stood amidst the sea of bodies, their expressions chillingly cold and seething with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They locked their eyes on Osborne, their murderous intent palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin and Crimson roared in unison, "In just ten minutes, over a hundred of our men have been wiped out! It seems we underestimated you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But mark my words, no one is leaving here alive today!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You killed our daughter and our subordinates; now, you will all pay! Every single one of you will face the relentless wrath of the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization until there's </span><span>nothing left of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Lambert family could only tremble in fear as they absorbed the overwhelming aura of death emanating from the two assassins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chilling sense of despair settled over them, creeping into their hearts like a shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne let out a cold snort, breaking through the suffocating atmosphere of dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed his gaze on Sin and Crimson with a faint smile. "You know, your daughter said something very similar to me before I blew her head off. And just a little while ago, your underlings echoed those very words, only to find themselves dead at my feet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Sin and Crimson froze, momentarily taken aback. But it didn't take long for their rage to boil over even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you're digging your own grave! You killed my daughter; now, I'll make it my mission to kill you!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
