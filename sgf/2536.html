  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On Inferno Planet, a Mid-grade Sacred Artifact battleship was speeding towards a certain direction in the cosmos. The people on the battleship were Osborne, Angela, and Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, they were heading to a resource-bearing planet at the edge of the cosmos being developed by the Frenetic Storm Warband.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three years ago, the Frenetic Storm Warband discovered this resource-bearing planet. After some exploration, they found a mineral resource codenamed X-36. This mineral is an essential material for constructing Level One Cosmic Translocator, Level Two Cosmic Translocator, and Level Three Cosmic Translocator, making it extremely valuable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Subsequently, the Frenetic Storm Warband began developing this resource-bearing planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After confirming that there weren&rsquo;t many dangerous Native Creatures on this resource-bearing planet, the Frenetic Storm Warband sent millions of slaves there, forcing them to continuously develop and mine, which has continued to this day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn&rsquo;t until the Phantomagic Realm was about to appear that the Frenetic Storm Warband&rsquo;s leader, Hamilton, temporarily left with a group of mid-to-high-level personnel to prepare for collecting and seizing the Dragon Elixir in the Phantomagic Realm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, what they didn&rsquo;t know was that Osborne had been waiting for them all along.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was standing on the deck of the warship, looking toward the resource-bearing planet. He felt a mix of anticipation, nervousness, and fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He worried that his parents were already dead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hamilton and the others had no memory of Osborne's parents, so Osborne still couldn&rsquo;t confirm whether his parents were alive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This place was at the edge of the cosmos, where the Cosmic Wind was incredibly fierce. Even warriors at the Supernal Deity King Level could hardly withstand the raging Cosmic Wind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But his parents, over twenty years ago, were only at Class AAA, not even reaching Junior Deity. Could they really survive in such an environment?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Could they really survive the torment and beatings of the Frenetic Storm Warband?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn&rsquo;t know the answer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he was extremely worried and anxious. He felt the speed of the Mid-grade Sacred Artifact warship was too slow. He desperately wanted to reach that resource-bearing planet immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whether his parents were alive or not, he wanted to know the answer immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, don't worry." At this moment, Angela and Agatha came up behind Osborne to comfort him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela said, "At our speed, we'll reach that resource-bearing planet in at most two days. By then, we will definitely rescue your parents. They will be fine."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing her words, Osborne bit his lower lip.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two days!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the vast cosmos, a two-day journey was already very short. But Osborne still felt it was a bit too long, so he decided to use the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Ascending Sacred Sanctum had been hanging on the Warfare Ancient Tree for some time, undergoing repairs. Since the Warfare Ancient Tree had devoured the corpse of the Magma Devourer and used most of its power to repair the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, it was now more than halfway restored.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, it was almost restored to its former glory.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the speed of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, they could reach that resource-bearing planet in just a few hours.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth and decided to use the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Angela said, "It's a pity that there's no Cosmic Translocator on that resource-bearing planet. Otherwise, we could have teleported directly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, Osborne stopped his action of preparing to take out the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne became excited, thinking, "Cosmic Translocator?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I can now build a Cosmic Translocator. I can even independently construct a Level Three Cosmic Translocator. Besides, I obtained a large number of warriors' Dimensional Bags in the Phantomagic Realm, so I'm not lacking materials to build a Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why not build a Cosmic Translocator and teleport us directly? That would be faster than using the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>We&rsquo;re actually not far from that resource-bearing planet. A Level One Cosmic Translocator would be enough. Building a Level One Cosmic Translocator is way too easy for me now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne became extremely excited and immediately took out many Dimensional Bags.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He directly took out thousands of Dimensional Bags, all belonging to warriors at advanced Empyrean Sacredness, Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, and even Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, Osborne didn&rsquo;t have time to carefully sort through the items in these Dimensional Bags.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne hurriedly said, "Angela, Agatha, come help me. Sort through these Dimensional Bags and gather all the materials needed to build the Cosmic Translocator."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Angela and Agatha were immediately very surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at so many Dimensional Bags, they showed expressions of shock. Osborne hadn&rsquo;t explained in detail what happened in the Phantomagic Realm, only telling them that almost everyone inside was killed by that demonic cultivator, and he himself almost died in there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, Adriana acted in time and dealt with that demonic cultivator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They didn&rsquo;t know Osborne had obtained so many Dimensional Bags. And these Dimensional Bags were high-grade, definitely belonging to warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hurry up!" Osborne urged Angela and Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Angela and Agatha were very curious, they didn&rsquo;t ask much and immediately started organizing. After opening one Dimensional Bag after another, their faces were filled with shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela exclaimed in surprise, "Is this a Superior Sacred Artifact?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha was also shocked. "I have a Legendary Sacred Artifact here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This Dimensional Bag has so many Sacred Crystals! This Dimensional Bag has so many materials! Is this a Superior Sacred Artifact battleship?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One Dimensional Bag after another was opened, and the contents were organized. Angela and Agatha were completely stunned because almost every Dimensional Bag was filled with countless treasures, even numerous Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There are even hundreds of Superior Sacred Artifacts and dozens of Legendary Sacred Artifacts here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After organizing thousands of Dimensional Bags, Angela and Agatha were completely overwhelmed with shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela said, "Osborne, there are a total of 12,000 Inferior Sacred Artifacts, 3,600 Mid-grade Sacred Artifacts, 720 Superior Sacred Artifacts, and 36 Legendary Sacred Artifacts here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Additionally, various materials for constructing Cosmic Translocators can fill three Dimensional Bags. These materials can build at least hundreds of Level One Cosmic Translocators, dozens of Level Two Cosmic Translocators, and several more Level Three Cosmic Translocators."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides that, there are 180 billion Sacred Crystals and enough rare materials to fill fifty Dimensional Bags."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Angela took a deep breath and looked at Osborne in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "What an enormous fortune this is! I&rsquo;m afraid many ordinary First-rate Powers don&rsquo;t possess such wealth. And all of this belongs to Osborne, all obtained from the Phantomagic Realm. What exactly did Osborne do in the Phantomagic Realm?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela and Agatha both looked at Osborne in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne remained very calm and found it quite normal. After all, in the Phantomagic Realm, twenty warriors at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, hundreds at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, and thousands at advanced Empyrean Sacredness had died. Their Dimensional Bags were almost all collected by Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if these people were very poor, the wealth gathered together is absolutely a huge amount.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even this doesn&rsquo;t include the Dragon Elixir they obtained.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These people had a total of one million drops of Low-grade Dragon Elixir, two hundred thousand drops of Mid-grade Dragon Elixir, ten thousand drops of Top-grade Dragon Elixir, and two hundred drops of Legendary Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These Dragon Elixirs are also a massive fortune.</span></p><div class="pagination">
