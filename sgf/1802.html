  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The white Miracle Elixir was renowned for its extraordinary healing properties. Legend had it that with this elixir, even the gravest injuries could be mended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was said that if someone had just recently died, a dose of the white Miracle Elixir could bring them back to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, such tales were often exaggerated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, while the white Miracle Elixir was indeed powerful, it couldn't heal every wound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Take Bryce's injury, for example.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His condition wasn't as dire as it seemed. If not for the lingering dark energy from Lord Malevolence embedded in his wound&mdash;continuously inflicting damage and undermining their healing efforts&mdash;both Osborne's Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity and Hannah's life power would have been enough to save him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the white Miracle Elixir could have done the trick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, the dark energy was weakening the elixir's effects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, their combined efforts were still yielding results.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, Hannah's life energy, and several doses of the white Miracle Elixir, they managed to stabilize Bryce's condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the very least, he wasn't getting any worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, Bryce began to regain consciousness, his brow furrowed as he murmured, "What happened to me? Why are you all crowded around me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bryce!" Kendra exclaimed, her voice filled with relief as she grasped his arm tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on?" Bryce asked, confusion etched on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attack from Lord Malevolence's shadow had been so swift that Bryce hadn't even had a chance to react before he was severely injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression was grave as he spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't talk! You've been seriously hurt! It was the dark energy left by Lord Malevolence in Caesar's body that attacked you! Right now, that dark energy is still in your wound, affecting our healing efforts. We need to disperse it before we can truly heal you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce opened his mouth, his eyes widening in realization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord Malevolence?! That bastard ambushed me?! Am I going to die, Osborne? Damn it, I'm not ready to go yet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned but remained calm. "Don't worry, you're not going to die! We'll do everything we can to save you! If it comes to it, I can even transform you into a Blood Clan member. That way, even if you die, I can bring you back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce rolled his eyes at that. "No thanks! I'd rather not become your Blood Clan offspring! Just do your best to save me! Whatever you need me to do, just say the word."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, relieved by Bryce's spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want to resort to transforming Bryce into a Blood Clan member unless absolutely necessary. Bryce was his friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning him into a Blood Clan member would change their relationship forever, even if it granted Bryce immortality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you channel your power right now?" Osborne asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce thought for a moment and then nodded. "I can!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great! Then let's work together! We'll drive out that dark energy from your wound! It's incredibly pure, but if we combine our efforts, we might have a chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's do it!" Bryce agreed, determination shining in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following Osborne's guidance, Bryce quickly activated his divine power, channeling his power in tandem with Osborne's dark energy to expel Lord Malevolence's dark force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Osborne's eyes lit up with hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's working!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel the dark energy lingering in Bryce's wound beginning to shift, no longer tightly wrapped around the injury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dark energy was like a tiny snake being slowly driven out of Bryce's body by Osborne's combined efforts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep up the life energy and the White Miracle Elixir!" Osborne shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hum filled the air as Osborne's dark power clashed fiercely with Lord Malevolence's energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though it was just a faint thread, it felt more stubborn than the late-stage Deity King, Caesar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was drenched in sweat. He'd rather face a powerful late-stage Deity King than this piece of dark energy from Lord Malevolence, which was proving to be a relentless adversary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought to himself, "This is way too strong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence's dark elemental essence must be at Level Ten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least it's not grounded; it will eventually fall to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a burst of dark power, Osborne intensified his assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dark energy seemed on the verge of being expelled from Bryce's body when suddenly, Osborne's expression hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked up from the arena floor, his gaze sharp and focused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face contorted with unease. "Shit! A peak Deity King from the Paramount Supreme Clan is here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!" everyone exclaimed in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pressed on, his voice grave. "This guy must have found out Caesar's dead! We need to stall him for at least long enough to heal Bryce!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group exchanged glances, their resolve unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll hold him off," they replied in unison.</span></p><div class="pagination">
