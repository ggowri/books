  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne punched out with all his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All his strength was now concentrated with mighty penetrating power, which stabbed </span><span>the Tauren Duke fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was how Osborne beat the Werewolf Duke before, forcing him to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, Osborne's </span><span>Point Blank</span><span> Force didn't work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Tauren Duke, just as he said, did not defend himself, did not counterattack, and did not even dodge. He just let Osborne's </span><span>Point Blank</span><span> Force hit his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what shocked Osborne was that the strong </span><span>Point Blank</span><span> Force was actually blocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Tauren Duke's skin was so strong and tough that it easily blocked Osborne's </span><span>Point Blank</span><span> Force, which was completely unable to penetrate his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His </span><span>Point Blank</span><span> Force had reached the level of proficiency level. Combined with his powerful strength, he had not encountered an enemy who could fully defend against it so far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Tauren Duke's skin was like a powerful defensive ancient magic weapon. Osborne felt that unless his strength was several times stronger, and his </span><span>Point Blank</span><span> Force reached the limit level, it would be impossible to penetrate Tauren's skin and hurt his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boy, your strength is indeed good. And your </span><span>Point Blank</span><span> Force is also well cultivated. But it's a pity that it's useless for me! Do you have any more powerful attacks? Keep attacking. The one just now was not good enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the Tauren Duke finished speaking sarcastically, Osborne snorted coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He struck again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath. Then, like a whale sucking water, he sucked all the air within 328 feet radius into his stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And every cell in Osborne's body seemed to be blessed with strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Breath of Celestial!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Breath of Celestial had now reached the fourth level. His every breath could increase his strength by 80%, making Osborne's already powerful strength even more terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne punched out again, hitting Tauren's body hard. The </span><span>Point Blank</span><span> Force burst out, trying to pierce the Tauren Duke's skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But unfortunately, it was still not enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Tauren Duke just frowned slightly and completely blocked Osborne's attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said coldly, "It seems that this is your limit! In this case, you have no value in existence. You are not even qualified to fight with me. You'll die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, the Tauren Duke finally took action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lowered his head and pointed his two horns at Osborne. He kicked his hind legs hard and rushed towards Osborne at a terrifying speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bull Charge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Buzz!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a moment, the Tauren Duke rushed in front of Osborne. And Osborne only had time to put his arms in front of him to block Tauren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body flew backwards and hit the villa heavily, knocking the whole villa down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Puff!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne spat blood and turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He touched his chest and found that several ribs were broken, and his internal organs had suffered a huge impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a strong impact!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Tauren Duke ended the charge and looked at Osborne with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tauren said, "Your defense is indeed good, but it still can't stop my charge! It seems that this is the best you can do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, the Tauren Duke lowered his head again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His two sharp horns were emitting a faint light. Osborne's Satan's Eye was throbbing wildly. And he felt a severe threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't wait any longer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought. Originally, he didn't want to defeat the Tauren Duke so quickly and wanted to delay time. But the Tauren Duke's charge was too much of a threat to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the space frozen, he couldn't escape just by relying on his speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he was hit a few more times by the Tauren Duke, he would be seriously injured even if he didn't die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In that case, let me defeat you first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted and prepared himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bull Charge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Tauren Duke kicked his hind legs and rushed towards Osborne again at a terrifying speed. But this time Osborne was prepared. Although he did not dodge, he could punch Tauren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deadly Force!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shouted loudly, and his body was instantly knocked away by the charge. But at the same time, his fist hit the Tauren Duke's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body flew one hundred yards away again. He vomited blood while in the air. His face was pale. Even the bones in his right arm were broken. His arm hung by his side, and he finally stood firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the Tauren Duke finished the charge, his body still maintained the charging posture, standing there motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at Tauren with anticipation.</span></p><div class="pagination">
