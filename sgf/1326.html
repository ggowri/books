  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Over a hundred Transcendent Deities! Hundreds of Superior Deities!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leaders of the Augustine family were stunned, their eyes wide with panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The combined might of these three factions was intimidating, far surpassing the Deschanel Clan, which had only twenty-nine Transcendent Deities and barely any Superior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The alliance brought a force at least four times stronger than the Deschanel Clan, and the true power difference was much greater once numbers reached this magnitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked to Osborne, their strongest hope against such a formidable alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew that the main defense against this onslaught rested on Osborne and his private army&mdash;the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of them could offer significant help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing Osborne's calm demeanor, they relaxed slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne wasn't panicking, there was still hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "Indeed, the combined power of these three factions is immense. I can't guarantee victory, but rest assured, since we know their plans, I won't let any harm come to you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have three days, and I'll use that time to prepare for their onslaught."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, most of the Augustine family leaders took their leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Sebastian stayed behind, concern etched on his face. "Osborne, I think we should contact the Prophet Alliance and the Lord League.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The threat from the Dark Deity, Pantheon League, and Eityreia Organization is not exclusive to us; they are also in the crosshairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they can unite, so can we with the Prophet Alliance and the Lord League. Faced with such overwhelming strength, an alliance is our best chance. I can reach out to the Lord League; they should understand the stakes and agree to join forces."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated, then nodded. "Joining forces with the Prophet Alliance and the Lord League could work, but will they believe us? If not, they might leak our plans."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian insisted, "Regardless, we have to try!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne agreed and held back further dissent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, his expression hardened suddenly. "Someone's approaching! They're not hiding their energy&mdash;a group of Transcendent Deity warriors."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's surprise was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group of Transcendent Deity warriors halted near Mount Celestial Reach. One of them stepped forward and announced, "Eddie Pike from the Prophet Alliance wishes to meet with Godfather Osborne of the Augustine family. We have urgent matters to discuss, Please."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback by the arrival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Members of the Prophet Alliance? What brings them here?" he wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's hesitation, he and Sebastian left the Augustine Bastion and ascended to the top of Mount Celestial Reach, where they observed the figures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading the group was an elderly man with white hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His aura was formidable, more so than Terrence's, which caught Osborne's attention. He noticed the man bore six Divine Flames&mdash;a former Deity Overlord indeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a twinge of apprehension as he spoke. "You're from the Prophet Alliance? What brings you to us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He deliberately avoided mentioning the alliance between the Dark Deity, Pantheon League, and Eityreia Organization, opting to first discover the Prophet Alliance's intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The white-haired elder stepped forward, bowing slightly to Osborne. "Greetings, Rosmandi Godfather. I am Eddie, acting leader of the Prophet Alliance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie's courteous demeanor toward Osborne was unexpected, almost unsettling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Pike, there's no need for such formality with someone much your junior," Osborne replied quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's only appropriate," Eddie smiled, seemingly unfazed by the suggestion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued, "I came to you, Godfather, to propose an alliance. I've foreseen a calamity threatening both Rosmandi's Augustine family and the Prophet Alliance. I believe only by joining forces can we effectively overcome this disaster."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie watched Osborne intently, perhaps concerned that Osborne might doubt his sincerity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback, his mind racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Eddie predicted this? Impressive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scrutinized Eddie sharply. Predicting the future was a powerful ability, one that could certainly alter fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All right. The Augustine family will ally with the Prophet Alliance to face this looming calamity together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, it was Eddie's turn to be surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You actually believe me, Godfather? You trust that a calamity is indeed approaching the Augustine family? You don't doubt my word?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, "Seems like even the Prophet Alliance can't foresee everything! I believe you because I already knew. In fact, I'm aware of the root of this impending disaster..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
