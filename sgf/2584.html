  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy's Legendary Sacred Artifact Spear unleashed terrifying flames, instantly forming dozens of massive fire dragons that lunged toward Yvonne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next moment, the massive fire dragons collided with Yvonne's blade energy, producing an earth-shattering roar. Then, under Yvonne's shocked gaze, all her blade energy was shattered head-on and devoured by the fire dragons.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And those massive fire dragons continued to charge at her, engulfing her in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next moment, all the fire dragons froze in place and began to tremble violently. Then, with a loud boom, they exploded and vanished without a trace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Yvonne was already charred and battered, but she held another sword in her hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That sword was radiating terrifying power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That is the Supreme Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Yvonne was about to be engulfed by Leroy's fire dragons and defeated, she unexpectedly drew a Supreme Sacred Artifact Sword.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She merely swung the sword lightly, and Leroy's fire dragons instantly collapsed and vanished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Supreme Sacred Artifact is too powerful!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone could see Yvonne holding the Supreme Sacred Artifact in battle. It was vibrating intensely, releasing waves of terrifying power that swept through everything around. Yvonne's body was trembling as well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can't lose!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I absolutely can't lose!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I bear the honor and dignity of the Royal Family! How could I possibly lose repeatedly to ordinary contestants? How can I fail to make it into the top ten?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I absolutely can't lose! I must defeat my opponent! I must make it into the top ten!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne murmured, her eyes blood-red, unleashing an incredibly terrifying power and killing intent from her body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Leroy was not afraid at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In her eyes, there was even a flash of pity at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because Yvonne's current state was all too familiar to her. This was the sign of being unable to control the Sacred Artifact, leading to the Sacred Artifact backfiring.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back in the city duel at Tempest Fortress City, Leroy was unwilling to lose to Osborne, so she forcibly unleashed the power of the Inferno Drake Lance. However, unable to control it, she suffered a backlash. If Osborne hadn't stepped in and knocked her unconscious in time, her life would have been ruined.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She would no longer have any chance to break through to the next cultivation level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Yvonne at this moment was exactly the same as she was back then.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Or rather, Yvonne's situation was even more dangerous. Because what backfired on Leroy was merely an Inferior Sacred Artifact, while what backfired on Yvonne was a Supreme Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The power of a Supreme Sacred Artifact is incomparable to that of an Inferior Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne clearly didn&rsquo;t have the strength to wield the Supreme Sacred Artifact. After forcibly using it and suffering backlash, cracks began to appear all over her body. Her body started collapsing under the backlash of the Supreme Sacred Artifact Sword!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And she seemed completely unaware of it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She still glared coldly at Leroy, intending to swing the Supreme Sacred Artifact Sword to defeat him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But doing so would only accelerate the collapse of her body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blood had already covered her entire body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy frowned and looked at Zorro. She asked, "Aren't you going to stop her? If you don't, she'll die from the backlash! Even if she doesn't die, she'll probably be crippled!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Leroy finished speaking, Zorro frowned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked up at Frederick and Callista sitting on the viewing platform, seemingly waiting for their orders.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Frederick and Callista both appeared very calm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zorro immediately withdrew his gaze and said calmly, "The battle isn't over yet!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy instantly became angry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She's already like this, and the battle isn't over? Are you willing to disregard her life just for victory? For the dignity and glory of the Royal Family, you'd rather let her die?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zorro remained silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, only Osborne sneered coldly below the arena.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Care about Yvonne's life or death? In the face of the Royal Family's reputation and glory, who would care about the life or death of a princess like Yvonne?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick wouldn't care!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because he has hundreds of descendants like Yvonne. Only those who show extraordinary talent and potential might earn his attention.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Yvonne isn't at that level yet!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick is a ruthless man!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, in Osborne's previous life, being humiliated and tormented by other princes and princesses, why didn't Frederick intervene? Just one word from him, and no one would have dared to bully or torment Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Frederick didn't do that!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick doesn't care about Osborne or his mother's life and death!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick only cares about cultivation level and strength!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's impossible for Frederick to stop this battle to save Yvonne, who is being backfired by the Supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unless Yvonne defeats Leroy first and secures a spot in the top ten, Frederick will not stop this fight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista is not Yvonne's biological mother. Since Frederick hasn't spoken, she is even less likely to intervene.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, only Yvonne's biological mother is anxious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She seems to be communicating with Frederick through Telepathy, but Frederick is ignoring her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Pathetic!" Osborne sneered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To be precise, the entire Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom is indifferent!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It is blood ties that bind them as a whole, not emotions!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though they rise and fall together, they wish nothing more than for each other to suffer as much as possible!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Truly pathetic and ridiculous!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne continued to look at the arena.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, seeing Zorro make no attempt to stop Yvonne, Leroy on the arena was utterly furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation was so much like her back then!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, she was backfired by the Sacred Artifact. Azure Haven Academy, in order to win the championship, also chose not to stop her but let her continue to act in her state of loss of control and backlash until she defeated Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne hadn&rsquo;t risked injury to forcibly knock her out, she might have long become inhuman!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, seeing the out-of-control, backfired Yvonne, Leroy felt as if she were seeing herself back then.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And she was the Osborne of back then!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Leroy wasted no time. She wanted to save Yvonne just like Osborne did!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fight!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Leroy gripped the Legendary Sacred Artifact Spear tightly and charged madly at Yvonne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Leroy, you're too kind-hearted!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Below the stage, Osborne knew what Leroy was about to do, so he couldn't help but shake his head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara couldn't help but smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Back then, weren't you the same to Leroy? Maybe it's because Leroy is as kind-hearted as you that she could become your friend!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was instantly stunned and fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The out-of-control and backfired Yvonne had terrifying power all around her. But unfortunately, her mind was not clear at the moment. If her strength was much greater than Leroy's, she might have been able to defeat Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, her strength wasn't much greater than Leroy's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was Yvonne's luck.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy forcefully broke through her attack and got close to her. Leroy used the spear to knock Yvonne out cold.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just like what Osborne did back then!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne was saved because of this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she lost the match, losing the Royal Family's dignity and honor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Being saved might not necessarily be a good thing for her!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But anyway, the fight between Leroy and Yvonne is over!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy defeated Yvonne and entered the top ten!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With their fight over, it's Osborne's turn next.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His opponent is Yunus Augustine, ranked fifth on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, stronger than Yvonne!</span></p><div class="pagination">
