  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's face lit up with a sweet smile as she heard Osborne's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tightened her grip on Osborne's hand and nodded vigorously. "Osborne, I will always love you! No matter how talented or impressive others are, my heart belongs to you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In my eyes, you're the most amazing person there is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glimmer of admiration sparkled in Clarissa's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always felt that everyone underestimated Osborne, oblivious to his true capabilities. Only she seemed to grasp just how remarkable he really was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And while she couldn't quite explain it to anyone else, deep down, she knew that Osborne was far more extraordinary than anyone could ever guess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan's expression darkened as he watched his daughter look at Osborne with that glint of admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of anger washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His daughter had never looked at him that way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Dylan felt a twinge of jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't shake the feeling that Osborne had somehow manipulated Clarissa's feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, how could someone like him, utterly worthless in Dylan's eyes, ever be seen as impressive?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was laughable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan scoffed, crossing his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Feelings can be cultivated! Clarissa, as your father, I will never harm you. You'll find true happiness only with Alexander by your side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your grandfather has already approved your marriage to Alexander, and the Paltrow family is preparing for it. There's no turning back now! You'll be tying the knot within a month at the earliest or three months at the latest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, come with me - right this instant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's expression hardened dramatically. "What gives you the right? Who are you to dictate my life? My fate is mine to control!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she clung tightly to Osborne's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, I will never go with you! I'm only going to be with Osborne. If you try to force me, then just kill me, consider me gone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you!" Dylan roared, fury boiling inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, he could never bring himself to kill Clarissa; instead, he directed his rage toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, I will never kill you. But if you refuse to come with me, then I'll have no choice but to eliminate him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Dylan shot a cold glare at Osborne, a lethal intent radiating from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, two elderly figures appeared behind Dylan, their gazes just as icy as his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt an overwhelming sense of dread wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart raced as he realized the gravity of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Those two are radiating a presence similar to Medusa's, maybe just a bit weaker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could they be... Class A- warriors?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Class A- wasn't the same as a master. The leap from Class B+ to Class A master was perilous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who succeeded became top-tier fighters worldwide, while those who failed often faced death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, some managed to survive without achieving mastery, landing them in the Class A- category.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weren't as strong as true Class A masters, and they could never attain that status, but they still wielded a fraction of a master's power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two elders exuded a strength that was clearly above a typical Class B+. They were undoubtedly Class A-.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "Could they be from The Wise Order of the Radcliffe family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"York?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Abraham?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you two doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Donna's exclamation confirmed Osborne's suspicions. The two figures were indeed the Third and Fourth Elders of the Radcliffe family, York Radcliffe and Abraham Radcliffe, formidable Near-Masters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna's expression turned grave as she clenched her jaw, grabbing Clarissa's arm tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Clarissa, don't be rash!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen to your father and get out of here now, or you'll get Osborne killed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's face was ashen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced nervously at her father and at York and Abraham, feeling a deep concern for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Osborne was formidable, but he was up against her father and two elder figures - Class A- level individuals, often referred to as Near-Masters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three of them together could take on a true Class A master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "How could Osborne possibly stand a chance against them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's going to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, don't worry! I told </span><span>you,</span><span> we'd face every storm together. Our fate is in our own hands! It won't be easy for them to kill me!" Osborne said firmly, his voice cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was ready to fight. No matter what, he would never back down or give up on Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan sneered, saying, "You've got guts, talking so tough! My opinion of you has changed a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But tough talk without the strength to back it up is just a ticket to an early grave! I'll say this one last time! Get lost. You're not worthy of Clarissa. If you don't get it through your head, I'll make sure you disappear forever!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let's see what happens!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was set in icy determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing three Near-Masters was daunting, but he was prepared to fight every inch of the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>York's voice cut through the tension. "Stop wasting time with him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare this lowly fool even think of coveting the Radcliffe family's Fatebearer? He's asking for death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him right here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, York made his move.</span></p><div class="pagination">
