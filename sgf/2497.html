  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The young man stepped forward, looking at Osborne and Agatha with surprise and curiosity. "You really don't know the Phantomagic Realm?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He is a primary Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glanced at Agatha and was captivated by her. After all, even though Agatha had altered her aura and appearance with the Sublime Concealment Orb, she was still very beautiful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, the man knew it was impolite to stare at someone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly said to Osborne, "That makes sense. You haven't even reached Empyrean Sacredness, so I don't think your goal is the Phantomagic Realm. After all, the Phantomagic Realm is very dangerous, and warriors below Empyrean Sacredness can hardly survive there, let alone gain any benefits."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne became even more curious and started talking with the young man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The young man, named Azael Lefroy, came from the Galactic Stellar Region, a star region similar to the Racial Convergence Stellar Region. This time, he had followed his family elders to prepare for entering the Phantomagic Realm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Azael said, "The Phantomagic Realm is very mysterious, a special celestial body constantly drifting along the edge of the universe. Inside, there are many small star-like bodies, but they are all illusory and unreal."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Legend has it that the Phantomagic Realm was formed from the corpse of an ancient and extremely powerful beastly sacred spirit, the Hallucimagic Dragon. Everything inside is illusory, a mirage. Anyone who enters will encounter all kinds of Heavenly Demons."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"These Heavenly Demons, even the weakest, are comparable to an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King, and they appear in swarms. Warriors below Empyrean Sacredness can hardly survive in the Phantomagic Realm and will be torn to pieces by the Heavenly Demons."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But if you have the ability to kill these Heavenly Demons, you can gain benefits. Each Heavenly Demon contains a trace of Demon Dragon aura. If you kill over a thousand of the lowest-level Heavenly Demons, you can gather enough Demon Dragon aura to condense a drop of Dragon Elixir."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"These Dragon Elixirs are truly valuable."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just one drop is enough to put you into an Enlightenment State, enhancing your comprehension and talent. Moreover, the higher the grade of the Dragon Elixir, the stronger the effect."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By the way, it can also enhance soul power."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After absorbing the Dragon Elixir, people can better resist illusions and Soul Attacks."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was a bit surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dragon Elixir can put people into an Enlightenment State? This effect is almost identical to Elven Sacred Water. But it doesn't sound as powerful as Elven Sacred Water.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, that only refers to ordinary Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dragon Elixir is divided into low-grade, mid-grade, top-grade, and Ultimate. The effects of low-grade and mid-grade Dragon Elixir are inferior to Elven Sacred Water, but top-grade Dragon Elixir is already on par with Elven Sacred Water.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the effect of Ultimate Dragon Elixir is far stronger than Elven Sacred Water. Moreover, it can also enhance soul power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne became interested in the Phantomagic Realm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He previously used nearly a hundred drops of Elven Sacred Water and underwent nearly a hundred enlightenments, which allowed him to elevate elemental essences like space, darkness, thunder, and fire to the Sacredness Level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was only later that Elven Sacred Water became ineffective for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Using Elven Sacred Water to enter the Enlightenment State brought him only minimal improvement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne still had many types of elemental essences, such as metal elemental, water elemental, earth elemental, wind elemental, light elemental... Currently, they were stuck at level ten peak, unable to break through to the Sacredness Level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These elemental essences were all just at level ten peak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If I can obtain Dragon Elixir and use it to enter the Enlightenment State, can I elevate all these elemental essences to the Sacredness Level? </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if low-grade or mid-grade Dragon Elixir d</span><span>id</span><span>n't work, top-grade Dragon Elixir or even Ultimate Dragon Elixir should be able to do it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">However, saving my parents is more important than the Dragon Elixir. After I rescue my parents, if there's still time, I'll go to the Phantomagic Realm to see if I can get some Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne made up his mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Azael said to Agatha, "Agnes, the Dragon Elixir from the Phantomagic Realm is a treasure. Moreover, not many people know about the Phantomagic Realm, and even fewer know it will appear near Stellar Region M72 Inferno Planet."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're lucky to have run into me. If it were someone else, they wouldn't tell you this. After all, the more people who know about the Phantomagic Realm, the more will come to compete with us for the Dragon Elixir."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You, like me, are a primary Sacredness Level warrior, fully capable of killing Heavenly Demons on the outskirts of the Phantomagic Realm. However, it is still somewhat dangerous. How about we team up, look out for each other, and split the rewards equally?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Azael patted his chest and continued, "In the Galactic Stellar Region, I may not be the supreme prodigy, but my strength is definitely not weak. Among those at the same cultivation level, few can defeat me. Even if surrounded by a large group of Heavenly Demons, I can surely protect you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha said calmly, "Forget about teaming up. We haven't decided to go to the Phantomagic Realm."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Agatha looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "Azael, thank you for telling us about the Phantomagic Realm. But just like Agnes said, we might not go to the Phantomagic Realm. We came to Stellar Region M72 for other matters, not for the Phantomagic Realm."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Azael looked a bit disappointed. "Alright. If you decide to go to the Phantomagic Realm, make sure to team up with me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he glanced at Agatha again. Clearly, he was very interested in Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha felt a bit helpless and could only move behind Osborne, using him to block Azael's fiery gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Azael didn&rsquo;t mind and simply thought Agatha was shy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He suddenly said in a low voice, "Since you don&rsquo;t want to go to the Phantomagic Realm, then leave here quickly and don&rsquo;t get tricked by those Cobalt Island people."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Cosmic Translocator here was definitely sabotaged by those bastards from Cobalt Island. They know we&rsquo;re in a hurry to get to the Phantomagic Realm and can&rsquo;t take a detour, so they deliberately damaged the translocator here to force us to hand over a lot of resources and wealth."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We have no choice because the Phantomagic Realm will appear in half a month, so we can only give them the resources and wealth. But it&rsquo;s different for you; since your goal isn&rsquo;t the Phantomagic Realm, there&rsquo;s no need to rush."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if you take a detour, it&rsquo;s just an extra month or two. If you can save so many resources and wealth, a one- or two-month detour is nothing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately raised an eyebrow and said nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he wasn&rsquo;t here for the Phantomagic Realm, he was also in a hurry and couldn&rsquo;t possibly take a detour for one or two months.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What's more, taking a detour might bring them danger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they encounter powerful Space Pirates, their losses would be even greater. Now, Osborne plans to decide after Angela determines whether the Cosmic Translocator can be repaired.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Angela walked around the Cosmic Translocator and was quickly walking back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately exchanged a glance with Angela.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela, with a calm and confident smile, nodded at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since Angela can repair the Cosmic Translocator here, things will be much easier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Dexter walked over and said, "Since you've checked the Cosmic Translocator, bring out all the resources we need. If we can repair the Cosmic Translocator sooner, you can use it earlier and get to Inferno Planet faster."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you miss the Phantomagic Realm, don't blame us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Dexter crossed his arms with an arrogant expression.</span></p><div class="pagination">
