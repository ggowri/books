It made no sense!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Clarissa had been bewitched!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, that had to be it! Osborne had used some insidious trick to deceive her. I had to expose him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia was extremely angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mentality had completely become unbalanced. She thought, "If Osborne really ended up with Clarissa, what did that make me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would I be seen as blind?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, who I had looked down on and divorced, found a girlfriend more beautiful, of higher status, and better in every way than me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How would others think of me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I would become the laughingstock of everyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking this, Ophelia's body trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way!" she </span><span>suddenly shouted,</span><span> her eyes bloodshot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne and Clarissa, lost in their passionate kiss, didn't notice her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long while, they finally parted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A crystalline thread connected their lips, making Clarissa's face flush instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She buried her face in Osborne's chest, too shy to lift her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly and whispered, "Clarissa, are you ready? From now on, we will face all the difficulties and bear our fate together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's body shook, and she nodded firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I am ready! No matter how difficult the future is, no matter how many people try to stop us, I will stand by your side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From this moment on, I will always belong to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body also trembled, and he was deeply moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded vigorously. "Alright! Then let's face together! No one can separate us, and no one can take you away from me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne's gaze turned cold and resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held Clarissa's hand and finally looked at the stunned crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled slightly and announced, "Everyone, I have something to declare. I am Clarissa's boyfriend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Clarissa looked up at Osborne with eyes full of affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also said, "That is right! I am Osborne's girlfriend! I will only be his girlfriend for the rest of my life. We are together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surroundings became eerily quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was utterly shocked and even felt numb, that Osborne and Clarissa publicly </span><span>announced their relationship on such an occasion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the crowd, Donna's face turned incredibly gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, she just sighed without interfering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Clarissa, why were you doing this? Is this really called fate? Choosing the hardest path, was there really a future?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna looked at Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was smiling happily, her face full of gentleness. Whenever she looked at Osborne, her gaze could melt any man's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But unfortunately, she only looked at Osborne this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna knew Clarissa was happy now, and as her aunt who watched her grow up, Donna was happy for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, thinking about the difficult path ahead, the upcoming matters, the opposition from everyone, and even potential life-threatening dangers, Donna could not be cheerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Well, at least she was happy now! Even if they could not be together in the future, this would be a precious memory for her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna finally showed a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, I have a gift for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly said to Clarissa.</span></p><div class="pagination">
