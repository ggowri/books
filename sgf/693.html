  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was dumbfounded and finally settled down after quite a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wrapped her arms around Osborne's waist and pressed her face against his chest. "Osborne, no matter whether you are an orphan or Godfather's grandson, you are always my beloved!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter who you are, I will always be with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was moved when he heard this. He hugged Clarissa tightly and nodded. "Yes, </span><span>You</span><span> are right. No matter who I am, an orphan or Godfather's grandson, I am who I am! Nothing will change, and I will always be with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Clarissa nodded vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked up at Osborne's handsome face with a blush, suddenly standing on tiptoe </span><span>and kissing him for quite a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, she said, "Osborne, Godfather said that the war is not over yet. The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> have only withdrawn from the rare metal mines but have not yet withdrawn from </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>. What should we do next?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne replied with a cold murderous look in his eyes, "Keep fighting, of course!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will kill all members of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> who dare to stay in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>!" Osborne said coldly and turned on the Draco Star Wristlet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His score on the leaderboard had been increased again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After launching counteroffensives in three consecutive rare metal mines, they killed four AAA-level masters and nearly thirty AA-level masters. His score soared by more than 9,000 points and exceeded 20,000 points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Emma, who ranked second, just scored a little more than 4,000 points, only one-fifth of Osborne's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned off the Draco Star Wristlet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He no longer cared about the leaderboard. If everything went as planned, no one could challenge his first place. </span><span>so</span><span> he planned to kill more powerful members of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go back now." Osborne took Clarissa's hand and went back to the Headquarters in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> through interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What awaited them was the excited cheers of the crowd, who didn't know about the existence of the Divine Bone Crystal, not to mention the horrible cloning plan of the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>. Learning that Osborne and Clarissa had won another great victory, they naturally became excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Osborne's score on the leaderboard was significantly higher than the second place. If nothing unexpected happened, he was going to be the first heir of the Augustine family soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne followed Godfather's advice and did not tell anyone about the Divine Bone Crystal. After all, there was no point in telling them. It would just cause them concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying hello to everyone, he went back to his room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's amazing!" Caleb exclaimed with emotion as he watched Osborne leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He certainly takes after Godfather and his parents&mdash;Theodore and Vivienne!" Caleb added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Caleb finished speaking, his cell phone suddenly rang, and he wore a wry smile. "It must be another call from Manson and James to help Matthew and Emma inquire about Osborne's situation! I have to say that Matthew and Emma are both outstanding. Unfortunately, they were born in the same era as Osborne. It's their sorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Caleb answered the phone, "Manson? You wonder why Osborne's score has soared by more than 9,000 points? There's no way they can beat him. His girlfriend Clarissa is incredible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne? He has a long way to go. Well, you might consider competing for second place instead of first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne returned to the room and began practicing immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unexpectedly, the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> also has the spatial power and has been able to create the Spatial Domain! No wonder Godfather was unable to kill him despite defeating him decades ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Few people can prevent those who can create the Spatial Domain from escaping! If I manage to gain the capability of creating the Spatial Domain, maybe I can provide some help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Domain?!" Osborne murmured, putting this out of his mind for the time being and continuing to strengthen the Spatial Prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed that when the Spatial Prison became perfect, he would be capable of creating the Spatial Domain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, Osborne stopped practicing, opened his eyes, and looked at Clarissa in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a hesitant look on her pretty face, Clarissa made several attempts to say something but finally held back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, what's wrong?" Osborne asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa bit her lip and shook her head. "No, nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, stood up, and held her waist. "Clarissa, we are in a relationship, and I treat you like family! You can tell me anything! You look unsettled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me what happened. Let me share the burden with you, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Clarissa heard this, she almost failed to maintain her composure and said worriedly, "Osborne, I'm afraid my family could be in trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face suddenly changed when he heard this. "What happened?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
