  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rematerialized deep within the Arctic Maw Chasm's sixth layer, swiftly locating and pocketing a token tucked away in a shadowy corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Another day bites the dust," he murmured, his Sacred Power perpetually at its peak thanks to his Chaotic Spiritual Root.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While everyone likely presumed him dead, Osborne was, in reality, having an easier and more comfortable time than anyone else on this layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd grown quite used to the perpetual storms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Satan's Eye, his token-finding speed was unmatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd long lost count-had he found a hundred? More?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Honestly, Osborne couldn't be bothered to tally them up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If converted to points, his score would be a staggering ten, maybe even twenty million, dwarfing Agatha's top-ranking million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, Agatha was sitting on a cool million points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Horace, holding the second-place spot, had racked up 800 thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, though, had noticed that Agatha's score hadn't budged in a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>What's she up to? Has she hit a dead end and can't find any more tokens? Or did she stumble upon some but just hasn't registered them yet? Maybe she thinks a mil's good enough and has called it quits, or even hightailed it to the seventh layer.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recalled Agatha grilling Rupert about getting into the seventh layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, she had her sights set on something called a Frost-kissed Heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frost-kissed Hearts were no joke. They were like a turbo-boost for one's body and made it a whole lot easier to meld with power. Even the big-wigs at the Empyrean Sacredness level were drooling over these things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Maybe Agatha's already in the seventh layer. Should I follow suit?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, he'd already amassed more than enough tokens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he tossed a few Clara's way, they'd both still be in the running for a top-ten finish, or even the first and second spots!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Maybe I should head to the seventh layer. After all, what's the point of racking up tokens if I can't hold onto them? If I'm not strong enough to defend what I've got, I'm just handing someone else the win.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>But if I can get </span><span>the </span><span>Frost-kissed Heart and protect my stash... hell, the tokens I've got now could easily land me in the top ten. Maybe even take the whole damn thing.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The temptation was undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Frost-kissed Heart&mdash;its ability to enhance the body and streamline power fusion&mdash;was exactly what he needed right now. If Osborne could get his hands on one, his strength would skyrocket. The thought alone sent a thrill through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I've already scoured half of the sixth layer, and there are barely any tokens left. Might as well take a shot at the seventh layer.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne made up his mind.</span><br><span>Seventh layer it is.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rupert's warning about the seventh layer being a death trap for even the most seasoned Empyrean Sacredness warriors lingered in Osborne's mind, but it didn't shake him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If anything, it fueled his determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Dangerous? Sure. But I've got a trick up my sleeve&mdash;immortality. Even if I bite the dust up there, I can just respawn on the sixth layer. No harm, no foul.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, the seventh layer wasn't a gamble&mdash;it was an opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>If I don't at least take a shot at finding a Frost-kissed Heart, I'll never forgive myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Agatha's got the guts to go, why the hell shouldn't I?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned on his heel and started making his way back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using Satan's Eye, he navigated the sixth layer with ease, dodging other competitors like a shadow slipping through the cracks. Soon enough, he stood before the Translocator, the gateway to the seventh layer. The cost to activate it? A steep 100 Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a dry chuckle. "100 Sacred Crystals just to take a peek? No wonder most people don't bother. But then again, most people aren't me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had raked in over a million Sacred Crystals in the city duel. So, the measly hundred needed to activate the Translocator was a drop in the bucket. He checked his surroundings to make sure the coast was clear, then wasted no time firing up the Translocator. In the blink of an eye, he bid farewell to the sixth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of dizziness hit him like a ton of bricks. But as soon as his feet touched solid ground again, he knew he'd landed on the seventh layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa! Did I take a wrong turn or something?" Osborne blurted </span><span>out,</span><span> his eyes wide with surprise as he took in his surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd been gearing up for a fight, expecting the seventh layer to be a real bloodbath compared to the sixth. He'd come armed to the teeth with the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow and even pulled out the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, just in case.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne'd</span><span> thought that if the going got too tough on the seventh layer, he could hunker down in the Ascending Sacred Sanctum for protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both the Ascending Sacred Sanctum and the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow were Sacred Artifacts, but the Sanctum was in a league of its own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though seventy percent of its defense runes were busted, it could still out-defend the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow by a long shot. In a real jam, it would definitely be his lifesaver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, as he stood there, Osborne realized all his preparations had been for nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The seventh layer seemed as harmless as a kitten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before him stretched a vast expanse of pure white. In the distance, a colossal snow-capped mountain soared into the sky, most of it veiled in clouds, giving it an otherworldly and serene aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, Osborne scratched his head, wondering if the Translocator had gone haywire. Maybe it hadn't sent him to the seventh layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm at all, but to some god-forsaken place instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Rupert had warned him that the seventh layer was a whole lot more treacherous than the sixth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this place? It seemed as safe as a baby in its crib.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Osborne was racking his brains over this, his face suddenly went pale. In an instant, his Satan's Eye started throbbing like crazy, and a chill of impending doom ran down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Damn it all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Satan's Eye had been his saving grace countless times. Without a second thought, Osborne summoned his Sacred Power to shield himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he quickly cranked up the power of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before the Ascending Sacred Sanctum could whip up its protective shield, a soft breeze caressed Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a split second, the Sacred Power that had been guarding him shattered like a vase dropped on a concrete floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the might of the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow was no match for this unseen force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the frigid breeze kissed Osborne's skin, it was like a vise around his bloodline. His body turned as rigid as a statue, and his thoughts hit a freeze-frame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, Osborne had already flipped the switch on the Ascending Sacred Sanctum's power. Just as his body locked up, the defense runes on the sanctum began to glow like fireflies on a dark night, quickly knitting together a defensive barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cool breeze battered the barrier, causing it to ripple like a pond struck by a pebble, but it couldn't break through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the drive core of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum was gobbling up Sacred Crystals like a starving man at a buffet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slowly but surely, Osborne's wits started to come back to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock and a lingering sense of terror flashed across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>That was a close shave! Thank God the Satan's Eye gave me a heads-up, or I'd be a goner. I owe that thing my life!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>This breeze might seem a whole lot tamer than those storms on the sixth layer, but it packs a punch that's ten, maybe a hundred times stronger! No wonder a bunch of Empyrean Sacredness hotshots bit the dust here.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It's the stuff of nightmares!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep, steadying breath. Feeling the Ascending Sacred Sanctum chugging through the Sacred Crystals at an alarming rate, he quickly stuffed 10 thousand of them into the energy core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he got a chance to take stock of his surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the spell of that gentle yet deadly breeze, the world was a flurry of snowflakes. Each one felt like a tiny harbinger of doom, sending shivers down Osborne's spine.</span></p><div class="pagination">
