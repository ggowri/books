  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone could feel Frederick's excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the supreme ruler of the Glorious Divine Kingdom and one of the three Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness of the Racial Convergence Planet, he unexpectedly failed to control his emotions at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was enough to show how much he valued this matter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone was looking at Seraphina, their expressions full of anticipation. As long as Seraphina handed over the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket, they could open the casket and venture inside to seek opportunities.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, that was the Skyfall Casket!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tens of thousands of years ago, the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet overthrew the Overpowering Dynasty's rule over the Racial Convergence Planet in one fell swoop. The power they displayed, even tens of thousands of years later, still commands immense admiration.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the source of their power was the Ninth Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they could enter the Eighth Skyfall Casket, perhaps they would become the new generation of the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Except for Osborne, Adriana, Clara, and others who already knew the truth, everyone else present was excitedly watching Seraphina.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina felt unprecedented pressure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked slightly flustered but quickly spoke, "Father! I did not let you down. I successfully passed the eighteenth level of the Celestial Spire, accomplishing what even the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet could not."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, a faint smile appeared on Frederick's face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was the result of his meticulous guidance!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, the only thing he cared about was the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he interrupted Seraphina's boasting without hesitation, "Seraphina, I already know all this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You did well, you didn't disappoint me. But now, please hand me the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon hearing this, Seraphina's face suddenly darkened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hesitated for a moment and then said, "Father, although I did pass the eighteenth trial of the Celestial Spire, I did not obtain the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Toby from the Celestial Spire told me the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket had already been taken in advance!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, I don't have that key."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Seraphina's expression revealed a trace of worry and fear. She nervously looked at Frederick, her body trembling slightly, as if awaiting judgment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The surroundings instantly fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone's eyes turned to Seraphina again, the earlier excitement vanishing without a trace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina didn't get the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket had already been taken by someone else.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Frederick's previously excited expression instantly froze, and a gloomy, icy aura suddenly emanated from him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His face turned unusually grim, and even the corners of his mouth twitched slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he still suppressed his anger, forcing a faint smile. "Seraphina, you&rsquo;re not joking with me, are you? At such a critical moment, don&rsquo;t play around! This joke isn&rsquo;t funny at all."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hurry up and hand over the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket! I haven&rsquo;t forgotten what I promised you. As long as you give me the key, everything is negotiable."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick's gaze was fixed firmly on Seraphina.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina was filled with fear at this moment and fell to her knees before Frederick with a thud.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She trembled as she defended herself, "Father, I truly didn&rsquo;t lie or joke! Emiliano and Matthew can testify that I did pass the eighteenth trial of the Celestial Spire! But I really didn&rsquo;t get the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The guardian of the Celestial Spire told me that someone passed the eighteenth level before me and already took the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket! When I asked who it was, it refused to answer, saying it was confidential.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I think maybe our previous information was wrong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet not only took the key to the Ninth Skyfall Casket on the ninth level but likely also took the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket on the eighteenth level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Or perhaps someone else had entered the Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet knew the secret of Necropolis City. We were able to enter Necropolis City, so perhaps others had the chance to enter as well."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina kept explaining.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But no matter how she explained, the aura emanating from Frederick grew colder and angrier, filling her with immense fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She could only kneel on the ground, repeatedly bowing and pleading, "Father, this really isn't my fault. I tried my best, I truly passed the trial of the eighteenth level, but I couldn't obtain the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you don't believe me, you can search as you wish!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I didn't hide that key, nor would I dare to! You've been so gracious to me, how could I possibly betray you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, only Seraphina's panicked explanations remained around.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone could see that Frederick's face had turned terrifyingly dark, with waves of suffocating anger and killing intent erupting from within him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This dangerous aura made everyone's expression change.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Callista didn't dare to speak at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She silently led Weston to slowly retreat, moving away from Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other Royal Family members also stepped back one after another.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ordinary people were even more terrified in such an atmosphere, not daring to get close at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Frederick was like a volcano about to erupt, and no one could predict when he would explode, turning everything around into ashes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Adriana, Osborne, and the others quickly retreated to a distance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, you&rsquo;ve ruined Seraphina!" Adriana's voice echoed in Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne merely gave a faint smile, watching the terrified Seraphina and the furious Frederick, feeling utterly pleased inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "They deserve it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for saying I ruined Seraphina?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What does that have to do with me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina's biggest mistake was having a cold-blooded father, a king who only cared about breaking through cultivation levels and completely disregarded family bonds.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She did her best but failed to get the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket; it's not her fault.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it were a normal father, he would only comfort and encourage his child in such a situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Frederick is a ruthless man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his eyes, Seraphina is merely a tool for gaining power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, because she failed to obtain the key, his millennia of preparation were wasted, and his hope of breaking through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness was shattered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His anger was out of control, even driving him to kill out of rage, and Seraphina was naturally his first target.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Useless!!" Suddenly, Frederick spoke, his voice squeezed through clenched teeth, cold and cruel, making one instinctively fearful. "What use are you anymore?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, Frederick struck immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He suddenly struck out with a palm, hitting Seraphina's head heavily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thud!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A loud sound echoed through the air as everyone saw Seraphina, kneeling on the ground and begging desperately, have her skull shattered instantly by Frederick's palm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, this still couldn't quell his anger. He kicked her again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina's headless body instantly exploded, turning into countless fragments of flesh and blood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina is dead!</span></p><div class="pagination">
