  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa went into seclusion to break through to Class A.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sixth heir's trial had not yet appeared. Osborne found his life suddenly became dull. He didn't know what to do anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it, I'll train!" Osborne said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne began to train.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, everyone at the Caldwell Manor was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia has awakened her powers!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia boarded the Alisa Ship to win Osborne back. The ship was attacked by the Ghost Ship. Some passengers were injured in the attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia was the most seriously injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ship's doctors all declared Ophelia beyond saving. Evelyn refused to give up and begged Osborne on her knees. Osborne finally relented and asked Isa to save her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, Ophelia would have died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this near-fatal injury turned out to be a blessing for Ophelia. Amid her life-threatening crisis, she awakened her powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could alter the time around her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After some practice, she could even stop time across the entire world for a brief moment if she used all her strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it only lasted for one second, it was still a power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a terrifying time power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire Caldwell family was shocked when she told Evelyn about her awakened power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the members of the Caldwell family's Wise Order appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a rich family like the Caldwell family, a metahuman was an unattainable presence. But now, the Caldwell family had its own metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recently, the Caldwell family's situation had not been good. The Wise Order had been discussing revoking Ophelia's </span><span>heir</span><span> status and choosing a new heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with Ophelia awakening her powers, her position as heir was important.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even all the members of the Wise Order had to defer to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, please leave. Don't spread the news about my awakened power yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, you stay," Ophelia said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia spoke coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone quickly left, leaving only Evelyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn looked at Ophelia with some fear, because she realized that Ophelia had changed recently. She had become cold, as if she had no emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze had become very frightening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, tell me again what happened after I was injured," Ophelia said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn bit her lip. "Ophelia, haven't I already told you once?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to hear it again!" Ophelia said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's tone intensified. In that instant, her eyes turned slightly blood-red. She stared at Evelyn. The time around Evelyn began to warp and slow down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clock in the distance was still ticking normally, but Evelyn felt her body freeze in place. Time seemed to stand still. It felt like only a second had passed, yet it also felt like a year had gone by before time returned to normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn gasped for breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Ophelia in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's expression remained calm. She said coolly, "Go ahead. I want to know if Osborne's attitude towards me is indifferent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn gritted her teeth but eventually told the story again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Ophelia dying? What does that have to do with me? Everyone dies eventually. It's just a matter of time. I've already said I have nothing to do with you two anymore. Please stop bothering me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If she died, I'd be very sorry. But if she died on the Alisa Ship, I will pay full compensation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heartless? So what? After what you did to me, do you still expect me to show you any mercy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not killing you is already me being soft!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not a doctor, I can't save her!" said Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn repeated Osborne's words to Ophelia once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia clenched her fists. Her expression grew darker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She murmured, "Osborne, do you hate me that much? No matter what, we were once married. Are you really that cold towards me? Even if I'm dying, you still won't forgive me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia suddenly burst into laughter maniacally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't want anything to do with me? If that's the case, we'll cut all ties from now on! One day, I'll make you regret it. I'll make you regret being so cold to me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I swear I'll make you regret it!" she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia raged furiously. Her gaze was terrifying. Evelyn was utterly terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn quickly grabbed her arm. "Ophelia, calm down! Osborne's words were cold, but he still saved you! Isa wouldn't have saved you if it weren't for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was Osborne who asked her to act, and that's why you were saved. No matter what, Osborne saved you in the end. You can't think this way. We..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!" Ophelia shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia cut Evelyn off, glaring at her in anger. "I don't need you to tell me what to do! Do you think I'm crazy? No, I'm perfectly sane!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just hate!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why does he get to look down on me? Why does he treat me like I'm nothing? Now I have powers, too. One day, I'll become stronger than Osborne. I'll trample him underfoot...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll make him beg to come back to me!" she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Ophelia finished speaking, her eyes were filled with madness and a thirst for power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clap, clap, clap!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the sound of clapping echoed sharply from behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can give it to you!" someone said.</span></p><div class="pagination">
