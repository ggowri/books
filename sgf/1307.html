  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Terrence realized they were surrounded, he didn't rush into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, he held onto a flicker of hope&mdash;perhaps this was just a coincidence, and the figures beyond the volcano weren't really after them but merely found themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, that hope quickly evaporated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The encirclement tightened, and Terrence and his companions could feel the relentless pressure from the warriors closing in on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear and realization washed over their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence's expression darkened. "They're all divine realm warriors?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nearly five thousand of them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, it's that Augustine family, a horde like an army! How did they find us?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need to break out of this trap! If we don't, we're finished!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic gripped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike his former self as a peak Deity Overlord, Terrence now found himself at the level of a Transcendent Deity. The last battle had made it clear: surrounded by members of the Blood Demon, even Transcendent Deities were doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had to escape or die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he contemplated the dire fate that awaited them, the reality hit hard&mdash;his group was all that remained of the Deschanel Clan. If they perished here, it would signify the clan's total annihilation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Terrence's eyes burned with fierce determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to his companions, his voice steady despite the dire circumstances. "Listen up, everyone! This is a make-or-break moment for the Deschanel Clan! We have to push past this blockade and ensure our legacy survives!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Deschanel Clan cannot go extinct on our watch! We'll split up and escape&mdash;if even one of us makes it out alive, they must remember to seek revenge! We will rebuild the Deschanel Clan to its former glory!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His followers exchanged glances, the weight of their fate heavy on their shoulders, but they nodded solemnly, understanding the gravity of their situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With steely resolve blazing in his eyes, Terrence shouted, "Then let's get moving!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll do my best to create an opening for you! No matter what, we must get out of here and keep the spark of the Deschanel Clan ablaze!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!" they cried in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Terrence and his comrades burst forth from the volcano. Eighteen Transcendent Deities and nine Superior Deities from the Deschanel Clan had no intention of engaging the Blood Demon fighters directly; instead, they scattered in different directions, each racing towards freedom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty-seven warriors fled in twenty-seven distinct directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For all the Blood Demon members, who numbered over 48 hundred, they had only five teams. While it looked like they had completely surrounded the Deschanel Clan, it was impossible to close off all escape routes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gaps appeared between each group, and they simply couldn't intercept all twenty-seven escaping warriors at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As several members of the Deschanel Clan darted toward the edges of the encirclement, the Blood Demon members scrambled to respond, splitting their forces from five into ten, then to twenty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that was stretching it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With only around two hundred fighters in each group, these makeshift teams might barely hold their ground against a Transcendent Deity. Defeating them would be an uphill battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they tried to break their formations any further, they'd put themselves in jeopardy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Blood Demon ranks were made up of Junior and Intermediate Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hundred against a single Transcendent Deity would be a struggle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, twenty of the Blood Demon combat teams managed to intercept twenty of the Deschanel warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the other seven would face a completely different fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne saw the unfolding chaos and let out a cold snort, addressing Divine Shadow and God of Star, "It's time for us to step in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence and the others, to give them credit, were quick to react. They dispersed before the Blood Demon could fully encircle them, snatching the last sliver of hope they had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Blood Demon managed to surround them, escape would be impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how could Osborne let them get away?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne, Divine Shadow, and God of Star sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body flashed, and he materialized in front of a Deschanel Clan Transcendent Deity who was about to make a break for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back off!" Osborne shouted as he unleashed a powerful kick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man, on the brink of breaking free, felt his heart leap with joy. But before he could even react, Osborne appeared before him, delivering a brutal kick that caught him off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He barely had time to shield himself, but the sheer force sent him flying backward. His face paled, and cracks began to spread through his Divine Body. Clutching his chest, he struggled to recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, unfazed, teleported again and found himself face-to-face with another Transcendent Deity from the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get back!" he repeated, kicking the second Transcendent Deity back into the fray, preventing his escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this time, the Blood Demon members had begun their carnage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two-hundred-strong battle squad faced significant challenges when up against the Deschanel Clan's Transcendent Deities. They struggled to overpower their opponents and often found themselves on the defensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, taking on the Deschanel Clan's Superior Deities was a different story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearly half of the Blood Demon members had reached Intermediate Deity status. And two hundred of them? It was a complete slaughter!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, some Blood Demon fighters finished off their foes and became available.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They quickly turned their attention to the Deschanel Clan Transcendent Deities that Osborne had kicked back and engaged them in a fierce battle.</span></p><div class="pagination">
