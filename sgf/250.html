  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne forcibly integrated all of the blood diamond's unique energy into his body cells.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel that his physical fitness was improving rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at the same time, the fearful pain also came over him instantly. Even though Osborne thought himself determined, he couldn't help but let out a painful wail, and his whole body was twitching and twisting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt as if every cell of him was being torn apart, healed, and then torn apart again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It repeated numerous times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kind of pain was not something a normal person could endure. The reason why Osborne did not faint immediately was because Satan's Eye suddenly burst out with a power, protecting his brain and consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, Osborne would rather faint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> he didn't have to endure the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had ever used blood diamonds to improve physical fitness. It was partly because the unique energy of blood diamonds was more effective in improving extra energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The status of extra energy had always been higher than that of martial artists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A metahuman of the same level was one level stronger than a martial artist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, the Sinclair family, who had obtained hundreds of blood diamonds, had never given the blood diamonds to martial artists to improve their physical fitness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Occasionally, some metahumans would try to use blood diamonds to improve their physical fitness, but they would choose to give up because of the severe pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, no one knew what consequences would arise from using blood diamonds to improve physical fitness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had to do this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his physical fitness couldn't be quickly improved to Class B+, he would surely explode and die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the pain at this moment made him want to stop immediately, he still clenched his bloody teeth, endured the pain, and continued to absorb the strange energy of the blood diamonds and integrate it into his body cells.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cells were torn, healed, and then torn again...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every cell seemed to be reborn, becoming more and more resilient, stronger and more vital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If someone cut off a small piece of Osborne's flesh and blood and observed it under a microscope, he would find that every cell of Osborne was covered by a faint red light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This layer of red light was the unique energy of blood diamonds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their existence made the connection between Osborne's cells closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his flesh and blood before were like a piece of pig iron, then after being tempered by the unique energy of the blood diamonds, his flesh and blood were rapidly transforming into steel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Osborne's Breath of Celestial also started to work automatically without him noticing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Breath!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gradually calmed down. The severe pain still continued, but as Osborne's breathing became faster, he was not that sensible to that pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne fell into a strange state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He closed his eyes and continued to absorb the energy of the blood diamonds into his body. Gradually, a faint red light emanated from his body, and it continued to expand and contract as if it could breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time passed slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour later, the unique energy of the five blood diamonds was completely absorbed </span><span>by Osborne. The bright red color completely faded away, turning into dazzling flawless diamonds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a long breath, and the air shot out of his mouth like a bullet, leaving a deep hole in the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne finally opened his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A gleam of light flashed in his eyes, showing a deep joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He </span><span>succeed</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He succeeded!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, the sixth elemental essence, the space elemental, also completed the fusion. His Devil's Light changed again, turning into a light blue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blue Devil's Light!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Devil's Light of level five!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The unprecedented Devil's Light was finally successfully integrated by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was extremely excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what made him more excited at this moment was the changes in his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clenched his fists and suddenly felt a terrible power spreading through every cell of his body. He could feel that his body was full of vitality, and every cell seemed to be breathing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What realm is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't believe it. He felt that his physical fitness had improved at least dozens of times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his physical fitness before was only comparable to that of a Class C+ martial artist, like a humanoid beast, then his physical fitness now was Class B+, or even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was like a humanoid Tyrannosaurus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His skin was very tough and more elastic than the hardest cowhide. Osborne was sure that even the most powerful armor-piercing bullet would not be able to penetrate his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt that he could punch through a half-meter-thick alloy steel plate with one punch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a terrifying power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The most important thing is not the increase in strength, but the vitality in the body!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt that even if his arm was chopped off at the shoulder, the huge vitality of his body would allow him to quickly grow a new arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could this be the power of self-healing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a legendary super power that only a Class A martial artist can possess! This is the power of the gods!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was completely shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that the real purpose of blood diamonds is not to increase the level of superpowers, but to change physical constitutions? Is everyone using blood diamonds wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't believe it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In any case, Osborne knew that he had made a fortune!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, even if he only relied on his physical strength, he was confident that he could </span><span>kill Class B+ psychics like Orion and Derek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Below Class A, he was not afraid of anyone!</span></p><div class="pagination">
