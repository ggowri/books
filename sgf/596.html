  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon couldn't believe it. Emma had countered his Dissolving Light with a simple block of ice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was he surprised, but Osborne, watching from the dungeon, was equally astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Using ice to refract light, that's clever," Osborne mused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it only works if the ice is strong enough. If it's too weak, the Dissolving Light will shatter it instantly, rendering it useless for refraction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Emma's ice powers must have reached the Intermediate Level!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued to observe the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Gordon used Dissolving Light, Osborne was taken aback. It wasn't the power of the technique that surprised him, but a strange feeling that he could do it, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was baffling to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had only just acquired the light elemental essence, so his control over light elemental power should be minimal. Dissolving Light was an Intermediate Level light elemental power, something Osborne shouldn't be able to grasp quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he had this persistent feeling that he could replicate it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne gave it a try.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, he was stunned. He could indeed use Dissolving Light effortlessly, and its power was far greater than Gordon's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is the origin of this light elemental essence that Isa gave me?" Osborne wondered, his mind reeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why does it feel so much stronger than the elemental essences I've absorbed before? It even helped me easily master an Intermediate Level light elemental power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was deeply shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this was undoubtedly a good thing. While Dissolving Light might not be the most devastating technique, it was still at an Intermediate Level. Its power was comparable to his Thunder Explosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Emma hadn't conceded in time, Owen would have been severely injured if not killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne inwardly scoffed at Owen's excuses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In any case, Osborne quickly mastered the Dissolving Light, which added another powerful tool to his arsenal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder what other tricks Gordon has up his sleeve," Osborne thought, turning his attention back to the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his Dissolving Light countered, Gordon was helpless against Emma. He let out a cold snort, and his body began to distort rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire arena was filled with warped light, making it difficult to see clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a dozen Gordons appeared around Emma, all charging towards her simultaneously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even without the Dissolving Light, I can still defeat you!" they shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The multiple Gordons attacked Emma from different directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma sneered, "Distorting Light? That trick might work on Owen, but it's useless against me. Do you think I can't tell which one is the real you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Emma extended her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Freeze!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Gordon to Emma's left suddenly paled. Layers of ice rapidly formed around him, threatening to encase him completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Light!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon roared, not having time to ponder how Emma had pinpointed his proper form. His body erupted in a blinding flash of Light, like a miniature sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ice encasing him began to melt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma let out a snort, and the melting ice immediately started to grow again at an accelerated pace. It was evident that Emma's control over the ice element surpassed Gordon's mastery of the light elemental.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gordon's face was etched with shock as he stared intently at Emma. She was only twenty-five years old, yet not only did she possess a Class AA rank, but her control over ice elemental power had reached such a formidable level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing is impossible!" Emma retorted coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're simply too weak!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With another wave of her hand, she commanded, "Freeze!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ice around Gordon grew even more rapidly, quickly enveloping his entire body. The Light emanating from him flickered like a dying flame and soon vanished completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, a massive block of ice stood before everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trapped within, Gordon's eyes were wide with disbelief, his body frozen in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We concede this match," Everett declared calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his hand, the ice encasing Gordon melted away without a trace, as if it had never existed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's expression changed, her brow furrowing as she watched Everett intently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett met her gaze with a faint smile. "Sebastian, it seems the Augustine family has indeed produced a remarkable talent. To possess Class AA strength and such mastery over ice power at such a young age is truly impressive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather chuckled softly, "She still has a long way to go. More training is needed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett said calmly, "Consider this round my loss, but with just this young girl, it'll be tough for the Augustine family to win. I suggest you get that divine artifacts ready."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather stroked the black cat's fur and replied calmly, "The battle has just begun. Who knows who will win or lose? Perhaps you'll be the one leaving behind the divine artifacts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll see about that! This girl is good, but she's too young. How many rounds can she win on her own?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Everett fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's face was grave. Although her victory over Gordon seemed effortless, only she knew how much strength she had already expended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this duel was a grueling series of continuous matches!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at Lance and Sam, biting her lip involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had no confidence in their abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma knew that if she lost, the Augustine family might indeed lose this gamble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had to eliminate the most vigorous opponents while she still had the strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then would the Augustine family have a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Emma looked towards the remaining five opponents, focusing on the other person with a silver Sword of Victory on their sleeve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a woman!</span></p><div class="pagination">
