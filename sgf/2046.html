  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, deep space is incredibly dangerous! There are so many uncertainties out there; you have to be careful!" Anastasia clutched Osborne's wrist tightly, worry etched across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, she would be staying behind on the border battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, regardless of where Osborne went, even if he didn't take her along, Anastasia would be training in Hope Haven, always able to appear by his side whenever she wished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Osborne was heading to deep space, leaving Hope Haven behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he put it, the place he was going was peculiar and fraught with peril. Bringing Hope Haven along would only make things riskier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That single statement sent waves of anxiety through Anastasia and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. I'll be careful," Osborne reassured her, gently ruffling her hair before doing the same to Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He added, his voice lightening the mood, "You need to look after yourselves, too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia, you'll be in charge of Hope Haven! If I run into trouble in deep space, I'll return immediately through Hope Haven!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia bit her lip and nodded vigorously. "Osborne, please be safe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra, Diana, Mila, and the others all took their turns to say goodbye to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded at each of them, a warm smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"See you all soon! Don't forget to keep training. I hope the next time we meet, you'll all be even stronger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne was enveloped in a swirl of spatial energy, and in the blink of an eye, he vanished from sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of heading straight to deep space, he found himself in a grand hall&mdash;the hall of the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was preparing to delve into a conversation with the God of Light, aiming to uncover more secrets about the deep space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light had ventured into the depths of the cosmos on numerous occasions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even her very own Sanctum of Light was an Apex divine artifact harvested from the enigmatic expanse of deep space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're planning to go to deep space?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light's surprise was palpable when she learned of Osborne's intention to spend the next month searching for opportunities to enhance his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her brow furrowed in concern. "Have you thought this through?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are indeed many treasures in deep space, including my Sanctum of Light, which I acquired from there! Besides the Apex divine artifacts, there are several items that can boost your strength and cultivation level, but they're incredibly rare!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the past, when the God of Night led us into deep space, we searched for hundreds of years, and our biggest gain was merely obtaining our own Sanctums! And that was with the help of the God of Space! Without his spatial power, we would have struggled to find anything at all, and there were times we almost didn't make it back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Many warriors have searched deep space for over a thousand years and returned empty-handed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light's expression was grave, a stark reminder of the dangers that lay ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, fully aware of the vastness and peril of deep space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Searching for treasures there was indeed a daunting task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hundred Spatial Clones had already scoured a considerable area, yet they had found nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several of them had even been destroyed by unforeseen circumstances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was essential to remember that each of Osborne's Spatial Clones possessed seventy percent of his strength and could utilize his spatial power and the Satan's Eye completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite this, they hadn't uncovered any treasures and had lost several clones in the process!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep space was not only sparse in treasures but also incredibly hazardous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne had to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, the usual methods of increasing his cultivation level were no longer sufficient, at least not in the short term.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the ability to accelerate time by two hundred times, turning one month into two hundred, and having an endless supply of Celestial Crystals and Miracle Elixirs, he still wouldn't make much headway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't even sure he could reach Ascension Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the treasures of deep space offered him a chance to rapidly elevate his cultivation level in a short time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One such treasure was the Spatial Gold Crystal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just one Spatial Gold Crystal, Osborne's space elemental essence surged from the early Level Nine to the late Level Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Treasures like the Spatial Gold Crystal hailed from the Umbra World, boasting effects that far surpassed those of Miracle Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne could acquire a few more of these crystals, he might even break through to Level Ten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that point, even if his cultivation level didn't rise, his power would skyrocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And deep space held more than just Spatial Gold Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light said, her brow furrowing in thought, "Deep space is truly unique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You possess spatial power, and your abilities are nearly on par with the God of Space from years past. The main difference is your cultivation level. In deep space, your spatial power will give you an edge over others, allowing you to navigate dangers more effectively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, you have the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity! I actually support your decision to venture into deep space. But you must remain cautious. It's not a paradise out there; it's a brutal world!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Many warriors from other realms scour deep space for treasures, and some of them are terrifyingly powerful&mdash;more so than Lord Malevolence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, a flicker of apprehension crossed her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although deep space is vast and encounters with others are rare, I've heard from the God of Night that there are individuals who exist solely to plunder. They possess unique abilities to track down other beings in deep space and will stop at nothing to rob and kill!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In short, it's dangerous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't provide you with much more information, but you must stay alert."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, realizing that even the God of Light had limited knowledge about deep space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he expressed his gratitude respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for the warning! I'll be careful. No matter what I find, I'll return in a month to stand alongside the Human Alliance against the Dark Deity Legion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light paused, then removed a hairpin from her long hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, take this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It bears my Divine Mark. I've charged it for you; you can use it three times! When activated, it will unleash an attack equivalent to seventy percent of my full strength&mdash;enough to handle most Ascension Seven Supernal Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you encounter something you can't handle, don't hesitate to use it. Your safety is paramount! Additionally, if anything happens on the border battlefield, I can contact you through this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beautiful, ornate hairpin flew toward Osborne, who stared at it in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an incredibly precious item&mdash;truly priceless!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bit his lip, wrestling with the urge to refuse, but ultimately accepted it, tucking the hairpin away with care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for this gift! I will be cautious! I'm off now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne didn't linger. He enveloped himself in spatial energy, and in the next instant, he found himself back in deep space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he gazed at the vibrant, swirling colors around him and feeling the chaotic spatial currents zipping past, determination filled his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deep space, here I come again!" Osborne declared, ready to face whatever challenges awaited him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
