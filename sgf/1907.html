The leader of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings! He's back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare he return! He killed Caesar from the Paramount Supreme Clan's Five Brilliant Scions! They must be itching to tear him apart! What a reckless move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The murmurs spread like wildfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as they took in the sight of the floating mountain, nearly leveled by Osborne's power, the crowd fell silent, jaws dropping in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's he up to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is he provoking the Paramount Supreme Clan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who can take him down?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne surveyed the crowd below, a cold smirk appearing on his face. To amplify his message, he summoned Anastasia, Zoe, and the others to join him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, of course, disguised herself as Vivienne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the entire Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings appeared, shock rippled through the citizens of Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are they planning?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're not going to slaughter, are they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear gripped the hearts of the people, worried that Osborne might unleash chaos upon them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had no intention of wreaking havoc on the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He called out, "Listen up, people of Wild Flame City!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Paramount Supreme Clan is nothing but a bunch of useless fools! Just a bunch of loudmouths with no real power! Last time, that Caesar from the Paramount Supreme Clan claimed to be one of their Five Brilliant Scions, one of their top talents, yet I took him down without breaking a sweat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These so-called elites aren't worth your loyalty! I advise you to wake up and stand against the Paramount Supreme Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why should they command the rest of you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, we are here to challenge the young talents of the Paramount Supreme Clan once again! We're setting up a stage right here, and in half a month, any young genius from the Paramount Supreme Clan can come to face us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flick of his wrist, he summoned a Dimensional Razor that sliced through the floating mountain, leveling it into a massive, flat arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In half a month, you'll see for yourselves that the so-called geniuses of the Paramount Supreme Clan are nothing but trash compared to us! I trust the Paramount Supreme Clan isn't too scared to accept this challenge?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they are, let their old-timers step in instead! We fear nothing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, the Paramount Supreme Clan is just a bunch of weaklings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged, a look of disdain etched across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words sent shockwaves through the gathered crowd, igniting both astonishment and anger among the various factions present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some brave souls shouted back, "Theodore, don't get too cocky! You think you can look down on the Paramount Supreme Clan? The real powerhouses haven't even stepped in yet! How dare you challenge them again? You're asking for trouble!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, the Paramount Supreme Clan's genius will definitely take you down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won't escape this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled at the threats. "Is that so? We'll see about that! In half a month, you'll witness me humiliating the talents of the Paramount Supreme Clan, trampling them underfoot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mark my words&mdash;half a month from now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the Paramount Supreme Clan truly has the guts, they should gather their best talents. Otherwise... well, it might just be too easy for us to wipe them out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, having achieved his goal, Osborne vanished in a flash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd in Wild Flame City erupted into heated discussions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a monumental event couldn't possibly escape the notice of the Paramount Supreme Clan's extensive intelligence network, and soon enough, the news reached them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings have appeared in the East Zone again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They've set up a challenging arena in Wild Flame City, daring the young talents of the Paramount Supreme Clan. They even said if the youngsters can't handle it, the older generation can step in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're asking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The various factions and families within the Paramount Supreme Clan were instantly consumed by rage, their faces contorted with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings provoke us again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We must eliminate them! This time, we cannot let them escape! Call upon the Supernal Deity Kings! Only they have the power to take down Theodore, the leader of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, who wields spatial power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely! They must be taken down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was thick with fury among the Paramount Supreme Clan members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the vast estate of the Baxter family in the distant West Zone, a group of cloaked figures stood ready for action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them radiated immense power, their eyes gleaming with lethal intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor's voice was cold and resolute. "Our mission today is to eliminate the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings! They've been hidden away for too long, but they must be holed up with the Hudson family! The Paramount Supreme Clan has given us orders to spare no effort in taking them down! If possible, we'll wipe out the upper echelons of the Hudson family as well!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
