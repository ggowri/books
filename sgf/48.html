  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Why are you here?&rdquo; Donna asked as she saw Clarissa approaching, but she didn&rsquo;t send her back with the bodyguards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just as Clarissa was about to speak, her expression suddenly turned cold and indifferent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa said, her tone casual, &ldquo;Aunt Donna, I just came to take a look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;No matter what, Mr. Augustine is my lifesaver. I hope you can thank him on my behalf. It would lighten my heart,&rdquo; Clarissa added, leaving her maid Rebecca stunned behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca couldn&rsquo;t help but think to herself, <span style="font-style: italic;">Just a moment ago, in her chamber, Ms. Radcliffe was calling him Osborne so affectionately. But now, in front of Donna, he&rsquo;s suddenly Mr. Augustine?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Rebecca understood that Clarissa&rsquo;s actions were for Osborne&rsquo;s benefit. The closer Clarissa got to Osborne, the more wary Donna would become of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The colder Clarissa was towards Osborne, the more relaxed Donna would be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca discreetly gave Clarissa a thumbs up, only to receive a sharp glare in return.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna, not dwelling on the matter, reassured, &ldquo;Rest assured, the Radcliffe family never owes anyone favors. Since you want to watch, let&rsquo;s watch together. I hope he can show some skills that impress me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, she turned her gaze towards the shooting range.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this moment, the bodyguard assessment at the shooting range was about to begin. A hundred professional bodyguards from the top ten security companies in Skyefall, along with the sudden addition of Osborne, a total of one hundred and one individuals, would compete for five positions through three challenging assessments.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Competition was fierce.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Each one of them was a top-notch expert, full of confidence in their abilities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This bodyguard assessment was bound to be thrilling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Listen up, everyone. There are three stages to this assessment, which were marksmanship evaluation, emergency evacuation simulation, and unrestricted combat assessment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;The top five overall performers across all three stages will become Ms. Radcliffe&rsquo;s bodyguards, with an annual salary of millions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Now, the first stage, marksmanship evaluation, begins.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With the command from the assessment officer, the marksmanship evaluation commenced. A group of ten entered the shooting range, showcasing their shooting skills.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The sound of gunfire filled the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">From fixed targets, moving targets, close-range rapid fire, long-range sniping, and shooting while on the move, the assessment content surprised Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The performance of his competitors also left Osborne slightly astonished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;No wonder they are the top bodyguards from major security companies; they are truly impressive,&rdquo; Osborne murmured as he watched the first group of ten complete the assessment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In Osborne&rsquo;s eyes, the difficulty of this assessment was significant. With sixty different targets at varying distances, each requiring specific tactical shooting positions, hitting all targets was essential to pass.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">For each target, there were specific tactical maneuvers required&mdash;some required shooting from a prone position, others from a standing stance, and yet more required shooting while on the move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The ranking would be based on the time taken to complete the assessment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The first group of ten quickly finished the evaluation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">All of them hit every target within three minutes, with the fastest almost making it under two minutes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne marveled at their professionalism.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This was only the first group, and with so many skilled individuals present, standing out among them and making it to the top five would be challenging.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon, the second group began their assessment, showing even stronger results than the first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The assessment continued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">On the high platform, Ophelia and Wesley were left dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;This is incredible. I never knew marksmanship could be so intense. If it were my bodyguards, many would struggle to pass. Even if they did, it would probably take over five minutes. The gap is just too wide.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley clicked his tongue in amazement but quickly brightened up because the more formidable these people were, the more challenging it would be for Osborne to stand out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;That Osborne, what a fool. Thinks he&rsquo;s all that. Bet he&rsquo;s regretting it now. Ophelia, you know him better. Where d&rsquo;you think he&rsquo;ll place?&rdquo; Wesley asked eagerly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia pondered for a moment before responding, &ldquo;My bodyguard once mentioned Osborne&rsquo;s marksmanship is spot on, but that&rsquo;s about it. Moving targets, shooting on the run, rapid-fire - none of those are his strong suits. He might land somewhere in the middle.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia suggested diplomatically, mindful not to diminish Osborne despite their conflicts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But even that assessment didn&rsquo;t sit well with Wesley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Middle of the pack? Really? Underestimating him, am I? Too bad being average won&rsquo;t cut it. He&rsquo;s destined for elimination.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With a satisfied grin, Wesley glanced over at Clarissa, who was not far away but was wearing a cool and aloof expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing her unconcerned demeanor toward Osborne delighted him even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;A classy girl like Ms. Radcliffe would never give a loser like Osborne a second glance. Remember how she hugged him before? Just a fluke, &lsquo;cause he saved her life. She&rsquo;s cooled off now. Osborne&rsquo;s chances with her? Absolute zero.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Now, that&rsquo;s more like it.&rdquo;</p><div class="pagination">
