  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After returning to the surface, Osborne looked at the massive Flash and felt a bit conflicted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash was a bit too eye-catching.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its three differently colored heads and six pairs of massive wings would make anyone who saw it stop in their tracks. If it were recognized as the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon, that would be trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, in most people's eyes, the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon is evil and brutal. They believe that once an </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon is discovered, it must be killed to prevent it from growing up and destroying planets and the Stellar Region, causing countless lives to perish.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Flash is a mutated </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon, its three heads and six pairs of wings are too distinctive. It would definitely be recognized as an </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shared this idea with Primordial, saying, "I can create a Pet Beast Space for Flash to stay in most of the time. The elemental essence of my spatial power has already reached the Sacredness Level, so I can easily create a space suitable for Flash to live in."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Pet Beast Space is essentially a stable Dimensional Space. Moreover, he can create terrains and environments suitable for Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Pet Beast Space? There's no need to go through so much trouble," Primordial said. "Although the elemental essence of your spatial power has reached the Sacredness Level, there are many in this world with spatial power stronger than yours. They are fully capable of invading your Dimensional Space without your knowledge. In the future, you'll encounter more and more experts. You must address such vulnerabilities as soon as possible."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne asked in surprise, "Someone can invade my Dimensional Space?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said, "Of course. It's not difficult. So, you shouldn't store your valuable items in the Dimensional Space anymore. I think the internal space of your Satan's Eye is quite good."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The internal space of Satan's Eye is vast. Moreover, as your Satan's Eye grows stronger, it will become even more expansive, and it will be very difficult for others to invade."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne began to ponder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt that Primordial made a lot of sense. The internal space of Satan's Eye was indeed spacious, and it was convenient for storing items, no worse than the Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, its security is much higher than the Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne was used to using the Dimensional Space and Dimensional Bag and didn't want to make a change.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then I'll store things in the internal space of Satan's Eye from now on. I'll call it Satan Space," Osborne decided.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He spent some time arranging and partitioning Satan Space. He transformed one part into an environment Flash liked, using it as Flash's Pet Beast Space. Another part was designated for storing important items like Sacred Crystal and Beast Soul Flower.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was very simple for Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, when Osborne tried to let Flash enter Satan Space, a problem occurred.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash showed resistance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seemed Flash really disliked being confined in the Pet Beast Space and only wanted to stay outside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit helpless and could only share his concerns with Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Flash, you can't stay outside because your features are too obvious. There are many bad people out there. If they recognize you as an </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon, they will attack you directly and try every way to kill you.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, go into the Satan Space. I promise you, as long as the situation allows, I'll let you out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's tone was like coaxing a child.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash tilted its three heads, seemingly deep in thought. Suddenly, an excited gleam appeared in its eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, its body began to change.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its 328-feet-tall massive body quickly shrank, and in the blink of an eye, it became only six feet tall. But even so, its three heads and six pairs of wings were still extremely noticeable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the next second, Flash's three heads turned into one, and five of its six pairs of wings disappeared, leaving only a pair of blood-red wings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even its tail disappeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, it wasn't over yet. Flash's appearance was rapidly changing. Soon, it transformed into a blood-red warhorse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Flash looked at Osborne with a smug expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seemed to say, "In this form, I can stay outside and don't have to go into Satan Space, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The enormous Flash had turned into a majestic blood-red warhorse, and it was a winged warhorse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had to admit, Flash looked pretty cool at the moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're so skilled at transforming right after being born. Flash, you're impressive," said Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Landing on Flash's back, Primordial smiled and said, "Flash, Osborne and I are on the same team. From now on, just call me Primordial. You not only need to listen to Osborne but also to me, got it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I run into trouble, you better help me. After all, without me, you wouldn't have hatched at all."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial looked at Flash seriously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash tilted his head, looking at Primordial, seeming a bit confused, then turned to Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded with a smile and said, "You can listen to Primordial."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash immediately nodded and then rubbed his head against Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial instantly became extremely happy. "That's great. Flash, since you're so sensible, I won't be stingy. As it happens, I have a few combat techniques in my memory suitable for the Beast Clan to practice. When we have time, I'll teach you properly and make sure you become stronger."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash became even happier, rubbing his head against Primordial nonstop.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne patted </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> head and said, "Alright. We should get going. Where is Magma Devourer? Let's quickly check the situation. If Magma Devourer is killed, we won't get its Marrow Crystal."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne sat on Flash's back. "Let's go!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After transforming into a blood-red warhorse, Flash's speed remained incredibly fast, even surpassing the speed of Osborne's Solar Battleship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt that the name Flash suited it perfectly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sitting on Flash's back, they quickly left the volcanic area and saw the traces of the battle between the judges and Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Magma Devourer headed towards the Cosmic Translocator," Osborne commanded Flash to quickly follow the battle traces left by Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Along the way, Osborne saw no one, only a few corpses, all participants of the zone duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned and said, "It seems Mr. Norton and the other judges couldn't stop Magma Devourer. Magma Devourer even killed a few more contestants."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I just hope Magma Devourer doesn't head to the western desert area. Leroy and Clara should still be in the western desert. Nothing can happen to them. Flash, speed up. We need to catch up quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Following Osborne's command, Flash let out a low growl.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, it dashed out at an even faster speed and quickly reached the location of the Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, when Osborne saw the state of the Cosmic Translocator clearly, his expression changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said in shock, "Oh, no! The Cosmic Translocator has been destroyed."</span></p><div class="pagination">
