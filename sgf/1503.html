  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, the woman's face revealed a look of genuine astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can it be so affordable?" she wondered, almost doubting her own eyes and rubbing them for confirmation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, already captivated by the estate's description, felt an immediate pull.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The features of the estate surpassed even his optimistic expectations, particularly its spaciousness, perfect for accommodating up to 50 thousand people effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a base for Spark of Blaze, it seemed almost tailor-made. As for the price, Osborne wasn't overly concerned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How much Essence Crystal does this estate cost?" he inquired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman hesitated but then spoke honestly, "This estate is priced at only 50 million Essence Crystal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After stating the figure, she murmured to herself, "Strange, how could the price be so low? I've been working here for so long, and this price seems off&mdash;it should be triple at the very least."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow. "Is there something wrong with the estate?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman shook her head firmly. "Absolutely not! And if you're interested, I can take you there right now. You can inspect it thoroughly before making any payment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "I'll put down a deposit first. If everything checks out, I'll pay the full amount immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fifty million Essence Crystal was a trivial sum to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He handed the woman 10 thousand mid-grade Essence Crystals as a deposit and followed her, swiftly arriving at the eastern edge of Wild Flame City's inner district. In front of them loomed a colossal manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing it, Osborne was immediately smitten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The estate was vast, rivaling even the Swift Manor in size, yet surrounded by an atmosphere of tranquil seclusion&mdash;there was only one other estate within a two-mile radius, separated by a small hill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The front of the estate boasted a picturesque garden, while the rear stretched along a roaring river marking the boundary between the inner city and the core area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and the members of Spark of Blaze toured the estate, each expressing palpable delight and satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the one! I'll take it!" Osborne declared decisively to the woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially skeptical that the woman's claim of the estate being underpriced might be a sales tactic, he now realized she had been completely truthful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a gem priced at only 50 million Essence Crystals was an absolute steal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even triple the price, 150 million, would have been reasonable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Osborne had to pay two or three hundred million for it, he wouldn't hesitate for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because this place was indeed perfect for the Spark of Blaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please contact the owner immediately. I want to finalize the purchase contract," he urged, eager to secure the property.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Osborne agreed, the woman immediately cheered up, delighted. The price had been set by the estate's owner, and whether it was too low or not didn't matter to her; as long as the transaction went through, she would get her commission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman, thrilled by the successful sale, quickly responded, "Absolutely, Mr. Lachlan Swift. I'll reach out to the owner right away. Let's head back to the Urban Development Exchange; the owner should be here shortly to sign the contract."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, and the group swiftly returned to the Urban Development Exchange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was late at night, and the office was quiet, but upon arrival, Osborne noticed several new faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Led by a middle-aged man, these newcomers exuded an air of authority and privilege, their formidable auras speaking volumes about their distinguished status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced around, his eyes narrowing as he took in the group. The middle-aged man stood out, a Celestial Deity warrior at the peak of his powers. The young ones flanking him were no less impressive, all Celestial Deities themselves. Osborne's surprise was evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All Celestial Deities? And these youngsters too? Must be from one of the big names," he thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not keen on attracting trouble, he took a seat in a corner, waiting for the manor's owner to arrive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man, however, wasn't so patient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked coldly, "What's the meaning of this? I've already stated that the manor in the east of the city is ours. The Keynes family, part of the Crimson Ironhoof Clan, doesn't take kindly to being refused." The salesperson hesitated, saying, "I'm sorry, sir, but that manor has already been reserved."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Reserved? By whom? We didn't waste a moment after hearing about the sale. Who could possibly have moved faster than us?" "It's a customer from the Human Community," the salesperson replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Human Community? Laughable! Those lowly Human Community members dare to compete with the Keynes family? Tell them to cancel the reservation immediately, or we won't be held responsible for our actions!" The salesperson, realizing the tension, suggested. "I'm afraid you'll need to discuss that with the gentleman yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Discuss it myself? Very well!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sensed trouble brewing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, the middle-aged man stormed over with the young warriors in tow, their presence menacing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they reached Osborne, the middle-aged man's expression hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So it's you, the lowly one from the Human Community, who dares to buy that manor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, unfazed, merely asked, "And who might you be?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
