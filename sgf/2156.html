For a hundred years, we've plotted your downfall. We discovered a secret technique that allowed us to turn the Ninefold Heaven's Tower into an Apex divine artifact with self-destruct capabilities!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The more energy the Ninefold Heaven's Tower stored, the more powerful the explosion would be! For the past hundred years, we have taken turns pouring our strength into the tower, even sacrificing our own breakthroughs in the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, though the tower has lost its top layer and its power has diminished, it has finally done what we set out to achieve&mdash;utterly defeating you! Even your Sanctum of Light has been obliterated...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, tell me, what can the Human Community do to stop us?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dark Deity Legion, hear my command! The God of Light is dead! Attack Peaks City with all your might!

While some still fought back, the majority had lost their will to fight, and there was no way they could withstand the Dark Deity Legion's onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adding to their woes, Icy One, Icy Two, and the other Dark Sovereigns had joined the fray after defeating the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their combined strength, paired with the Dark Deity Legion's assault, was too much for the Human Alliance to handle.

Surrounded by members of the Blood Demon and the Hudson family, they formed one of the last bastions of resistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here, they managed to hold the line against the relentless onslaught of the Dark Deity Legion, but even their strength wasn't enough to change the tide of the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they witnessed the Human Alliance crumbling, with more and more members raising their hands in surrender, fury etched itself across Anastasia and Zoe's faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't surrender!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Paramount Supreme Clan wants to wipe out the Human Community&mdash;surrendering won't save us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The God of Light isn't dead yet; we still have a chance!

Anastasia shouted, but her words fell on deaf ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Alliance fell like wheat before the scythe, swiftly surrendering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cries only seemed to attract more attention from the Paramount Supreme Clan's warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone shouted, "The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings are here!

Finish them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dozen Supernal Deity Kings charged in, all of them Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings, with even more from the Paramount Supreme Clan racing to join the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's expression hardened dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Protect them!" Jethro roared, commanding the Hudson family soldiers to safeguard Anastasia and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Intense fighting erupted, and Anastasia and her companions could no longer focus on the rest of the Human Alliance. They bit their lips and unleashed a frenzied assault, trying desperately to hold their ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, with the Hudson family's help, the combined forces of the Dark Deity Legion and the dozen Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings, along with several Ascension Two and Three Supernal Deity Kings, couldn't break through their defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle had reached an impasse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph! Seeking death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a towering figure appeared not far away, and the sight sent waves of joy through the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Icy Five!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Icy Five has arrived! The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings are finished!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's face paled, her fists clenched tightly as she glared at Icy Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Five was an Ascension Six Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia knew that even if she teamed up with Zoe, Mila, Kendra, and Hannah, along with the Blood Demon members and the Hudson family soldiers, they stood no chance against Icy Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were in deep trouble!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead of fear, their expressions were filled with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Alliance was collapsing, and if no savior appeared soon, it would all be over&mdash;Peaks City would fall, and the entire Human Community in the West Zone would be doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, where are you? Why aren't you back yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Anastasia thought of Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She believed that if he were here, he could turn the tide, rally the Human Alliance, and stand against the Dark Deity Legion, even launch a counterattack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But alas, Osborne had been gone for nearly a month without a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Five's voice was as cold as ice. "Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, your doom is upon you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your talents are truly enviable; given enough time, each of you could grow to the level of the God of Light.
