  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Frederick was extremely furious, filled with murderous intent, and launched an attack on Adriana without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He is still in Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, compared to before, Frederick's energy had clearly become more robust and fierce. At this moment, the dark red Panoply Armor on him shimmered with a bright crimson glow, as if breaking through some kind of seal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It is clearly an Imperial Artifact Armor!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The ornate longsword in Frederick's hand was also emanating intense Imperial Artifact energy, so it was an Imperial Artifact Sword!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, a terrifying attack capable of shattering the heavens and earth instantly struck Adriana's back. Adriana spat out a mouthful of blood, and a sword mark appeared on her Inferior Imperial Artifact Armor. However, she didn&rsquo;t turn around; instead, she used the immense force to rush even faster toward the black vortex.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, she and May vanished into the black vortex.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick grew even angrier. "Damn it! You can't escape! This place is incredibly far from the Racial Convergence Planet. I won't let you return. I prepared for tens of thousands of years to finally enter the Eighth Skyfall Casket and gain the power to break through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, but you ruined it. My breakthrough failed at the last moment, delaying my advancement to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness even further."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I won't let you go! You're dead! Chase her!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick furiously chased after Adriana, with Callista following behind him. At this moment, Callista's body was also radiating the powerful energy of Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clearly, in the Skyfall Casket, she also gained immense benefits, breaking through Common Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness to reach Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, becoming a supreme warrior on the Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She followed behind Frederick and madly rushed into the black vortex.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, none of them noticed that at this moment, the hundreds of people following behind them, including Weston and Quinn, suddenly exchanged glances and revealed eerie smiles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A profoundly mysterious vortex emerged in their eyes. But soon, the vortex vanished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We can finally leave," the hundreds murmured in unison. Then, they returned to normal and rushed into the black vortex.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the other side, Adriana also didn't notice that May beside her revealed an eerie smile, with a black vortex appearing in her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>May whispered, "I&rsquo;m finally out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, after leaving the black vortex, Adriana prepared to take May into the void, intending to cross the void back to Racial Convergence Planet after shaking off their pursuers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But just then, she suddenly saw a translocator in the void.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Level Three Cosmic Translocator? How can there be a Level Three Cosmic Translocator here? There was clearly nothing here when we came," Adriana said in surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had no idea that this Level Three Cosmic Translocator was built by Osborne. Osborne had already returned to Racial Convergence Planet through the translocator, leaving it behind here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Adriana felt the black vortex shaking violently. She knew Frederick and the others would soon catch up. So, without hesitation, she took May and rushed into the translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, she activated the translocator and disappeared from the spot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Frederick emerged from the black vortex.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Adriana and May disappear into the translocator, his expression changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it! She actually prepared a complete Level Three Cosmic Translocator in advance?" Frederick was furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought the translocator was something Adriana had prepared in advance. At this moment, he rushed into the translocator, only to find it collapsing rapidly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was because Adriana tampered with the translocator before leaving to prevent Frederick from catching up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it!" Frederick was furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The translocator had already collapsed, and he could no longer pursue Adriana. By the time he set up another translocator, Adriana was long gone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick roared, "Ms. Alba, you can't escape. When I return to Racial Convergence Planet, I will lead an army to destroy the Fairy Moon Sect. Submission to me is your only option. Just you wait!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes were filled with murderous intent. "Set up the translocator!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the other side, through the Level Three Cosmic Translocator left by Osborne, Adriana returned to Racial Convergence Planet. She immediately let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana thought, "Luckily, there was a Cosmic Translocator. Otherwise, it would have been hard to shake off Emperor Frederick's pursuit. Even if I managed to escape him, it would take me a long time to return to Racial Convergence Planet and the Fairy Moon Sect."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, the Fairy Moon Sect would likely have already been destroyed by Emperor Frederick and his forces. Although he hasn't reached Imperial Empyrean Sacredness yet, he's very close to it. In fact, he could achieve Imperial Empyrean Sacredness at any moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he didn't have the Imperial Artifact Armor and the Imperial Artifact Sword, I might be able to fight him. But now..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Adriana's face turned extremely grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although she disrupted Frederick's plans in the Skyfall Casket, preventing him from smoothly reaching Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, she hadn't completely stopped him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Frederick's power had become even more terrifying than before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "He succeeded in the end!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana felt a surge of pressure. She knew very well how much Frederick hated her. Once he returned to the Glorious Divine Kingdom, Frederick would definitely lead an attack to destroy the Fairy Moon Sect immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "I must return to the Fairy Moon Sect immediately and prepare in advance. At the very least, I need to relocate all the core disciples, like Isa and Clarissa. As long as they survive, even if the Fairy Moon Sect is destroyed by Emperor Frederick, they will surely create glory once again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of Isa and Clarissa, Adriana then thought of Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn't help but sigh, as she hadn't seen Osborne come out of the Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana thought, "Osborne must have already died in the Skyfall Casket."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, for some reason, Adriana felt very uncomfortable. She took out the terminal and tentatively dialed Osborne's terminal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the next second, she was stunned, because the terminal was connected, and Osborne's extremely excited voice came through.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Ms. Alba, you're indeed still alive. Have you also returned to the Racial Convergence Planet?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Adriana was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, Osborne reunited with Adriana. However, when Osborne saw May beside Adriana, he was startled, his face filled with shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "May is still alive? How is this possible?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was utterly shocked. He had personally seen May enter that eerie forest, witnessed her trapped inside, and then pierced through a vital spot by tree branches.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, May actually appeared!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Osborne was extremely shocked, he didn&rsquo;t show it. He quickly used Telepathy to communicate with Clara and the other two, instructing them not to act unusual.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt that May seemed off and thought, "How can someone who died appear again? What exactly did May go through in that forest?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, you're all alive! That's great!" Adriana was delighted. "What exactly happened? Why didn&rsquo;t we see you when we came out? I thought you had died in the Skyfall Casket."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was speechless; he had also thought Adriana had died in there, but it turned out they just weren&rsquo;t teleported out at the same time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn&rsquo;t help but ask, "Ms. Alba, did you come out of the Skyfall Casket with others? Besides May, who else came out with you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very curious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana didn&rsquo;t think much and replied, "There were many people, including Emperor Frederick, Queen Callista, Prince Weston, and Prince Quinn. They all came out with me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, Osborne was shocked again, thinking, "They&rsquo;re all alive! What on earth is going on?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
