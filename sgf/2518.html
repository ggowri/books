  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne and Flash were resting, mainly because Flash couldn't hold on anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne wasn't tired at all, and his Sacred Power was still at its peak. He could jump into a new battle right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Flash was already exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a battle maniac, the moment he heard about a fight, he got excited. If his opponent was weak, he wouldn't be happy and would even complain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, he had obviously become numb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For seven days, Flash and Osborne had been fighting those advanced Empyrean Sacredness Illusionary Heavenly Demons. The key was that Flash had to stay at the front, endure their attacks, and create opportunities for Osborne to take them down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, his defense was stronger than Osborne's, making him more resilient, but his attack power was weaker, and his killing efficiency was far inferior to Osborne's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So for these seven days, Flash was basically taking a beating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although those advanced Empyrean Sacredness Illusionary Heavenly Demons couldn't truly deal him fatal damage, constantly getting hit and injured made him naturally unhappy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Flash rested to regain his strength while looking at Osborne with a resentful gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile and comforted Flash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "The Phantomagic Realm will only exist for a month. Ten days have already passed. Once it disappears, you won't even have the chance to experience battles."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are the strongest of the Beast Clan. You were born for battle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're strong, only you can do it this well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, Osborne's praise was endless. Finally, he managed to calm Flash down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne took out a jadeflare vial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Inside was the sparkling Legendary Dragon Elixir, a full hundred drops.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And these were their gains from the past seven days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, they collected two hundred drops of Top-grade Dragon Elixir in just three days. But afterward, it took them seven days to gather only one hundred drops of Legendary Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The advanced Empyrean Sacredness Illusionary Heavenly Demons were indeed much harder to deal with than the mid Empyrean Sacredness ones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Against mid Empyrean Sacredness Illusionary Heavenly Demons, Osborne could almost wipe them all out with the Arrow Storm of Earth Arrow. Even if some remained, they would be swiftly dealt with by Flash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for advanced Empyrean Sacredness Illusionary Heavenly Demons, Osborne could only kill about a hundred with a single Arrow Storm. He needed to cast Arrow Storm multiple times to eliminate them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was somewhat dissatisfied with this speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Should I use Heaven Arrow next? If I do, my speed of obtaining Dragon Elixir will definitely increase! But every time I use Heaven Arrow, I have to wait half an hour before I can use it again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I encounter danger during this time, I'll have one less trump card!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Forget it! In this separate illusionary space, there is no danger, except from the Illusionary Heavenly Demons. So, I don't need to keep Heaven Arrow as a card!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne made a decision and immediately stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Flash, let's move on! It's already the tenth day. Maybe in a few days, this independent illusionary space will disappear. By then, you won't have such a good chance to fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash immediately got up, filled with fighting spirit again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after, a loud boom echoed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Facing the advanced Empyrean Sacredness Illusionary Heavenly Demons, Osborne used Heaven Arrow for the first time. The terrifying Heaven Arrow instantly crushed and obliterated most of the three thousand Illusionary Heavenly Demons, showcasing its immense and terrifying power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under Osborne's Earth Arrow's Arrow Storm and Flash's Dragon's Breath, the remaining Illusionary Heavenly Demons didn't last long and were quickly dealt with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thus, their speed in killing Illusionary Heavenly Demons and obtaining Legendary Dragon Elixir increased at least threefold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In just three days, Osborne obtained another hundred drops of Legendary Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, the quantity of Legendary Dragon Elixir reached two hundred drops.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne noticed a group of smaller meteorite bodies ahead, numbering only about a hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the aura of these meteorite bodies was Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Illusionary Heavenly Demons of Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was shocked to find that there were actually Illusionary Heavenly Demons of Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection in the Phantomagic Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly thought, "If the Illusionary Heavenly Demons of Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection are killed, would the Dragon Elixir they condense be even stronger than the Legendary Dragon Elixir?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Azael said the highest quality of Dragon Elixir is Legendary, and he has never seen anything beyond Legendary Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps it's because no one has ever obtained a higher-level Dragon Elixir! After all, to get a Dragon Elixir, one must kill a thousand Illusionary Heavenly Demons! And among those who enter the Phantomagic Realm, very few are capable of killing a thousand Illusionary Heavenly Demons of Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the Phantomagic Realm only exists for one month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To kill a thousand Illusionary Heavenly Demons of Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection within a month..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt that it was very difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The most important thing is that Illusionary Heavenly Demons always appear in groups. Although there aren't many Illusionary Heavenly Demons of Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, there are still about a hundred of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warrior wouldn't dare provoke them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It would take at least several Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warriors working together to dare make a move against them. But Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warriors are already rare, and forces with several of them likely wouldn't even be interested in the Phantomagic Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne hesitated, wondering whether to provoke these Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection Illusionary Heavenly Demons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his and Flash's strength, if they were facing a single Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection Illusionary Heavenly Demon, they could completely take it down. Osborne's Heaven Arrow could definitely severely injure or even kill it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when a hundred Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection Illusionary Heavenly Demons gather together, that's trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne and Flash fall into their siege, they could both die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "Should I give it a try?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection Illusionary Heavenly Demons contain a denser Demon Dragon's Breath! Once they form a Dragon Elixir, its effect will surely surpass a Legendary Dragon Elixir!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was somewhat tempted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I'll give it my all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyway, Osborne is now trapped in an independent illusionary space and has no way to search for the Frenetic Storm Warband. Instead of wasting time, he might as well give it a try.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the worst-case scenario, with his spatial power, he can completely escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But even if he wants to act, he can't be impulsive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne and Flash must change their strategy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, Flash can no longer stand at the front to absorb attacks. After all, he can't withstand the attacks of a hundred Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection Illusionary Heavenly Demons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'll be killed instantly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne and Flash can only attack from a distance. Once some Illusionary Heavenly Demons are killed, they retreat and then slowly deal with the rest!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After thinking it through, Osborne immediately drew his bowstring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Solar Sacred Arrow, Heaven Arrow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After getting ready, Osborne had Flash charge forward to activate those Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection Illusionary Heavenly Demons. Before they could attack, Osborne released the bowstring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The terrifying Heaven Arrow shot out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the leading Illusionary Heavenly Demon was killed by the Heaven Arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Success!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was pleasantly surprised. His strongest move, Heaven Arrow, could indeed kill Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection Illusionary Heavenly Demons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Illusionary Heavenly Demons have no Defensive Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their defense is much weaker than Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warriors. It's normal that they can't withstand the Heaven Arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, after being used once, the Heaven Arrow enters a half-hour cooldown time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne wants to use it again, he must wait for this time to end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without the Heaven Arrow, if he wants to continue killing these Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection Illusionary Heavenly Demons, it will be difficult!</span></p><div class="pagination">
