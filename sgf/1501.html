  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah bit her lip. "Grandpa, I had no idea he was from Paramount Supreme Clan! They look exactly like Human Community members. I just wanted to have a friendly sparring match with him. Who knew he'd take a single loss so badly that he tried to kill me? I had no choice but to..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man suddenly cut her off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't talk about it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face turned grave, and a formidable energy erupted around him, enveloping both of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hannah, remember, some things are not to be spoken aloud! Paramount Supreme Clan has warriors who can sense words even from millions of miles away. Never utter certain things!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah nodded firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least we can be relieved that no outsiders have seen your true face. That Paramount Supreme Clan prodigy doesn't know who you are. Unfortunately, you used a Mystic Feather Clan secret technique. Given their arrogance, they might target the entire clan because of this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But whatever happens, never admit that it was you! Remember, Mystic Feather Clan and the Gellar family will protect you. No one will ever harm you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in Hannah's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, Grandpa. I've implicated the Gellar family and Mystic Feather Clan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man smiled gently. "It's too early to say that. Perhaps nothing will come of it. Now, let's move on from these heavy matters. Let's see what that Human Community guy is up to. When the sky falls, we will catch it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Changing the subject, the old man turned his attention to Osborne and the Spark of Blaze members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was surprised. "What? They're heading towards the Urban Development Exchange. Is he looking to buy property in Wild Flame City? Does he still have Essence Crystals? He'd need a large estate to settle so many people, and estates in Wild Flame City aren't cheap! Even within the inner city, they cost tens of millions, even hundreds of millions of Essence Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could he have really found an ancient god's treasury?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But there haven't been any large estates on sale recently in Wild Flame City."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's eyes lit up. "Grandfather, we do have an idle property near the junction of the inner and core areas, close to my residence. It's spacious enough to house not just five thousand but even 50 thousand people. Since it's just sitting there, why not sell it to him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man looked at Hannah in surprise and laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you already planning for him before even marrying him? Selling it to him is not out of the question, but he must pay the full price. That estate isn't cheap. Are you sure he can afford it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah blushed. "Grandpa, what are you saying! I just suggested selling it while the opportunity is there. If he can't afford it, it's his problem."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then. Besides, our Essence Crystal mine has been constantly attacked by Deathborns lately, straining our resources. Selling this estate could ease our financial strain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the old man agree, Hannah was thrilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then asked, "What's the situation with the Essence Crystal mine? I heard it's been shut down. Are those Deathborns really that powerful?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elderly man's face grew solemn. "Indeed, it is formidable! But even if it is so, we have ways to handle it! The crux of the matter is that Deathborns keep emerging without ceasing, and we can't pinpoint the reason!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not your concern, so let's not disturb the Essence Crystal mine. We'll manage it ourselves and ensure you receive your cultivation resources without fail."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah furrowed her brows, her voice resolute. "Grandpa, I've grown up! You can't keep treating me like a child. I have the capability and the duty to share the burden for our Gellar family! I cannot merely consume resources without contributing anything in return!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, the matter of the Essence Crystal mine, I will take it upon myself! I will investigate what's causing the endless Deathborns and resolve the issue!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a determined glint flashed in Hannah's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man opened his mouth to speak but ultimately refrained, merely nodding. "Alright then, if you insist on shouldering some of the Gellar family's burdens, I won't stop you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But do be cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our Essence Crystal mine is close to those of the Demonic Dragon Clan and the Soaring Lion Clan. Steer clear of them and avoid any mishaps."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understand, Grandpa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their conversation concluded, and they both turned their attention back to Osborne and the crowd from Spark of Blaze, who were now standing at the entrance of the Urban Development Exchange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All real estate transactions in Wild Flame City must go through the Urban Development Exchange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, accompanied by Betty and her two sisters, as well as Darren, stepped inside.</span></p><div class="pagination">
