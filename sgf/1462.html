  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! This Lachlan, kicked out by the Swift family, might just end up on the shelves at the slave market tomorrow!" someone jeered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man of the Margery family, Zion Margery, smirked in agreement. "So, Lachlan, let's have Ms. Hart check your finances right away! If you can't cough up four million, you won't have to wait until tomorrow; you might just find yourself on the auction block today!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, anyone who dares to stir up trouble at the slave market doesn't end up in a good place!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But don't worry! If you do get auctioned off, I'll spend a pretty penny to buy you! I want you to grovel at my feet like a dog every single day!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shot back coldly. "Nice plan, but you won't get that chance! The slave market won't touch me. If you want to try, go ahead&mdash;because that's the only way I'll get to smash your face in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned to Tiana. "Do we really have to check my funds?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't need to rush. I've already acquired those twenty Human Community female slaves, and the payment is coming through soon. You'll see for yourself whether I have the four million or not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana nodded but sighed, saying, "I understand, but the crowd is quite vocal. They're insisting I check your finances to ensure everything's in order. Most of them are significant clients of the slave market, some even VIPs with certain privileges. I have to meet their demands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied, "Alright then, I'll cooperate with the check. But I need to step out for a moment first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, Zion chuckled derisively. "What's the matter? Planning to scrounge up some cash? Or maybe you're thinking of making a run for it? Ha! You clearly don't have the funds, and yet you dare to make outrageous bids. You're finished!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hart, it's crystal clear what's going on here. Why not just grab this troublemaker and throw him on the auction block? I'm sure I can offer a good price for him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disdain on his face was evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana frowned and said quietly, "Lachlan, if you don't have that much Essence Crystal, your previous bids have already disrupted the auction. I'll give you a chance to gather the funds, but you can't leave. I'll take you to a room where you can contact someone to get the money sent over immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Tiana led Osborne to a private room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got ten minutes! If you can't come up with four million... no, not four million, but ten million within that time, don't blame me for not giving you a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The next one on the auction block could very well be you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled at her words, saying, "Ten minutes is more than enough. I'll have it sorted out quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once inside, he closed the door and cast a divine power to envelop the entire room, ensuring that no one outside could perceive what was happening within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was doing this to retrieve the money from his Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of his Essence Crystals were stored there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana wanted to verify his financial status, but he couldn't just pull out Essence Crystals in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he used his spatial power openly, it would reveal his abilities and expose his true identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne needed a safe environment to extract the Essence Crystals first before allowing Tiana to check.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Four million Essence Crystals was a significant sum, and he had to handle it discreetly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Osborne switched to top-grade Essence Crystals, he still had around four hundred pieces. However, Osborne was reluctant to expose his top-grade assets too easily, so he decided to pull out mid-grade Essence Crystals instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To gather four million low-grade Essence Crystals, he would need a total of 40 thousand mid-grade Essence Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To gather 40 thousand mid-grade Essence Crystals required quite a bit of space. A regular bag simply wouldn't cut it, and even if it could hold that amount, it wouldn't be practical to carry around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most people preferred the convenience of storing their Essence Crystals in a bank, exchanging them for banknotes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne had Dimensional Space, so he had no intention of going through the hassle of converting his assets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It looks like I'm going to need a Dimensional Bag! My spatial elemental essence is already at Level Six peak. Creating a Dimensional Bag should be a piece of cake!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, he sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Dimensional Bag was essentially a pouch whose interior space was transformed into a miniature Dimensional Space. It looked like an ordinary bag on the outside, but inside, it held a whole other world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such Dimensional Bags were considered special divine artifacts, extremely valuable and rare nowadays, as no one knew how to produce them anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of what existed were remnants from the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne retrieved an ordinary bag and harnessed his spatial power, quickly constructing a small Dimensional Space within it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, he extracted some mid-grade Essence Crystals from his own Dimensional Space and loaded them into the newly created Dimensional Bag. Once he was set, he dispelled the divine power surrounding him and opened the door to step outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana was waiting just outside the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he emerged, the onlookers of the auction were all snickering, their faces twisted with disdain as they regarded Osborne with a mix of scorn and amusement.</span></p><div class="pagination">
