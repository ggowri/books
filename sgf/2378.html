  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought of a place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was an extremely dangerous place. In his previous life as a prince of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, he had heard of it many times. His father had always longed to explore it but had never been able to go for certain reasons.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression turned slightly grave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "If it really is that place, then it all makes sense!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If it really is there, I must participate in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel. The things inside must not fall into my father's hands, nor can my siblings get them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a moment of thought, Osborne regained his composure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy said, "Osborne, the translocator won't be available for us until the day after tomorrow. In the meantime, should we take a trip to </span><span>Zephyrville</span><span>? It's the largest city in </span><span>Wascod</span><span> State and one of the most bustling cities in the entire Glorious Divine Kingdom."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I heard that the auctions here often feature rare and unique treasures. If we can win one or two, it will definitely boost our strength further."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but smile wryly upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Auction? I'm definitely interested, but I have no money!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The 1.3 million Sacred Crystals I won from the casino during the city duel are almost gone; now I only have about 200,000 Sacred Crystals left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's almost impossible to buy anything good with just 200,000 Sacred Crystals."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy continued to persuade, "Come on! We don't have anything else to do anyway. Training won't improve much in such a short time. Even if you don't buy anything, gaining some knowledge isn't a bad idea."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, under Leroy and Clara's enthusiastic invitation, Osborne agreed. The three left their residence and began strolling around </span><span>Zephyrville</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara said, "Osborne, the auction is held in the evening. For now, let's explore the city. There's a trading area in the north called Star Street, meaning the treasures on this street are as numerous as the stars, with everything you could want!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Star Street is the largest trading area in the entire Eastern Zone 3, and good stuff often shows up there. We can take a look; maybe we'll find some great bargains."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the evening, we'll head to the auction!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded, going along with Leroy and Clara's plan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the three arrived at Star Street.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was a wide street, bustling with people, and various energy auras intertwined. With just a glance, Osborne noticed many Empyrean Sacredness warriors moving between shops, selecting items.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So lively!" Leroy, though he'd heard of Star Street, was visiting for the first time, his face full of surprise. "Let's go! Let's check it out!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Remember, Star Street has plenty of treasures, but it's also full of fakes. Unless you're absolutely sure about an item, don't buy it lightly," Leroy reminded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile. He possessed Satan's Eye, capable of seeing through the essence of any item.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could never be fooled by fakes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three entered Star Street and stopped in front of the first shop. There weren't many items inside, but each radiated a strong aura of Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The shop owner said, "Is there anything you like? Everything here is genuine treasure! Look at this bottle, it contains Elven Sacred Water."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you know Elven Sacred Water? It's a rare treasure! The Elven Mother Tree produces only one drop every ten years! Just one drop can put you into the Enlightenment State, enhancing your cultivation."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are all Quasi Empyrean Sacredness warriors. With Elven Sacred Water, it will greatly help your future breakthrough to Empyrean Sacredness. I have ten drops here, each priced at only one hundred thousand Sacred Crystals. Only I can offer such a price. If it weren't for needing money urgently, I wouldn't bear to sell them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You'll definitely regret it if you miss this chance."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The shop owner was a middle-aged man with four arms. At this moment, he was excitedly waving his arms, passionately introducing the mysterious liquid in the bottle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The liquid emitted a rich Sacred Power, clearly extraordinary at first glance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The middle-aged man's words instantly made Leroy and Clara show expressions of excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two exclaimed, "Elven Sacred Water?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their breathing quickened slightly; it was clear they had heard of Elven Sacred Water and knew its powerful effects. To them, exchanging one drop for a hundred thousand Sacred Crystals was already a bargain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They stared at the bottle, their eyes revealing a hint of longing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne couldn't help but let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said calmly, "Your so-called Elven Sacred Water isn't fake, is it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The middle-aged man's face changed drastically upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He angrily questioned, "Don't talk nonsense! I've been selling goods here for over a hundred years and have never sold anything fake! Everyone around can vouch for me! If I sold fake goods, I would have been retaliated against long ago!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is genuine Elven Sacred Water, passed down from my ancestors. If you don't want to buy it, fine, but if you dare to slander me, don't blame me for being rude!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, he stared fiercely at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, unfazed, calmly said, "If I hadn't seen the real Elven Sacred Water, I might have been fooled by you. Unfortunately, you're wrong. The real Elven Sacred Water would never have such a strong Sacred Power aura, and it's not transparent; there are also elf phantoms moving within it. These are features that can't be faked."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, the middle-aged man's expression changed instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Realizing he had encountered an expert, he immediately packed up his things and coldly said, "Stop spouting nonsense here! Even if you wanted to buy, I wouldn't sell it to you! What do you know? I think the ones you've seen before are the fakes! Get lost and stop ruining my business!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he drove Osborne and the other two away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne merely gave a faint smile, unconcerned. Even if he had never seen the real Elven Sacred Water, under the insight of Satan's Eye, the liquid in that bottle was nothing more than an ordinary spiritual drink infused with a trace of Sacred Elixir's aura through special methods.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Consuming it does offer some benefits, but entering the Enlightenment State through it is impossible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said nothing more. After all, shopping on Star Street relies entirely on one's discernment. If someone lacking ability gets scammed, they can only blame themselves for not improving. Since he had already spotted the issue, there was no need to argue with the shopkeeper and make a scene.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This would do him no good.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne pulled Leroy and Clara away and headed to the next stall.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, was that bottle of Elven Sacred Water really fake? I couldn't tell at all! I thought the stuff in that bottle must be a treasure!" Leroy asked softly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly and replied, "It is indeed a good thing, not entirely fake. It does contain spiritual drink and a portion of Sacred Elixir. If it were worth only a hundred Sacred Crystals, it might be worth considering. But charging ten thousand Sacred Crystals per drop is blatantly daylight robbery."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Leroy's eyes widened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She trusted Osborne's words and immediately nodded, saying, "It seems that shopping on Star Street really requires caution. There are too many fakes!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they spoke, they had already arrived at the second shop.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne glanced casually.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the previous experience in mind, he had already lost hope. However, with just one glance, his expression suddenly froze, and he abruptly stopped in his tracks.</span></p><div class="pagination">
