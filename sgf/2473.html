  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt immense pressure at this moment. He knew he couldn't stay any longer. The wealth he carried was simply too vast. If someone couldn't resist and decided to act here, it would spell trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the chaos, it's hard to say who could seize his Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, but he would surely die.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne quickly said to Clara and Leroy, "I'm leaving! Don't worry about me. Let's meet again at the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel! Also, although you don't have many Kingdom Duel Scorepoints left, theoretically no one would target you, but still, be careful."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Especially be cautious of Brenda and Brenda's Sect&mdash;Skyearth Dominion! Brenda and Skyearth Dominion must hate me to the core, and since you're with me, if they can't find me, they might retaliate against you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you run into trouble, you can contact General Ian Augustine! Just tell him I sent you to seek his help, and I believe he will assist you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne finished speaking quickly, and Clara and Leroy nodded firmly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We've got it all remembered!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Then I'm off! Over the next six months, focus on training and improving your strength! I hope you'll be much stronger when we meet again!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne quickly walked away into the distance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is the outskirts of Crescentia, surrounded by flatlands, and no matter where Osborne goes, countless malicious eyes are watching him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The reason they haven't made a move yet is that too many people have their eyes on Osborne, and they're all wary and on guard against each other.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But seeing Osborne about to leave, many of them immediately stood up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt multiple senses locking onto him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If it were someone else, they probably couldn't escape in this situation! But... you want to steal my Kingdom Duel Scorepoints? Then catch me first!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne suddenly made his move.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In front of him, a massive crack suddenly appeared. The depths of the crack seemed to connect to hell, incredibly deep and bottomless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, without hesitation, jumped into the crack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Osborne had vanished from the spot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as he left, dozens of incredibly powerful figures suddenly moved, arriving at the spot where Osborne had left in the blink of an eye, carefully sensing the surroundings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Spatial Power</span><span>&#65281;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;This kid used spatial power to escape! But does he really think he can shake us off like this? How naive! Just an ant below Empyrean Sacredness, and he dares to think he can evade us? Ridiculous!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;Watch me track his location!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, these dozens of figures began to use their respective methods. They had long decided to act against Osborne, so how could they not be prepared? They had already silently captured Osborne's aura and power. With their abilities, following Osborne's aura and power, no matter where he went, they could catch up to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;&#28145;&#31354;&#65311;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, someone sensed Osborne's location and acted swiftly. Terrifying power erupted, forcibly breaking the void and diving in.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't have spatial power, but his strength was overwhelming, allowing him to forcibly tear open space and enter deep space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, more than a dozen people forcibly tore through space and pursued him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The remaining group of people looked a bit grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were all advanced Empyrean Sacredness. With their strength, they still couldn't tear through space at will to enter deep space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the very least, it requires Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection to achieve that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, when they realized Osborne had actually hidden in deep space, their faces instantly darkened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn Osborne, he actually hid in deep space! With our strength, we can only enter deep space through a translocator!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But if that's the case, by the time we get there, that kid will probably have been devoured without a trace left!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What a pity!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These people looked full of regret and had no choice but to give up. After all, their strength wasn't enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But even though they gave up, there were still over a dozen Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection and Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warriors who pursued into deep space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those onlookers who hadn't left couldn't help but shake their heads at the sight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne is doomed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No one can save him! Even if he hides in deep space, there's no way he can escape!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He can only blame himself for carrying such treasures while being too weak and lacking a strong background..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who knows who will benefit in the end? That's over 46 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints! In the Glorious Divine Kingdom's treasury, that could exchange for nearly five Supreme Sacred Artifacts! Whoever kills Osborne and seizes his Kingdom Duel Scorepoints will instantly become one of the wealthiest people!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Too bad we're too weak to compete with those Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection and Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection guys!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd eventually dispersed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment in deep space, Osborne was desperately fleeing, constantly using spatial power, trying to escape as far as possible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But soon, his expression changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They caught up? Impressive! They actually found my approximate location so quickly. Looks like they each have their own methods to track my aura!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked serious but remained calm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although they had chased him into deep space, catching him wouldn't be that easy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If only I had the Sublime Concealment Orb!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With the Sublime Concealment Orb, I could easily hide my aura or even change it! They wouldn't be able to track my escape route based on my aura and catch up with me..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Right now, I'll need some tricks to shake them off."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne continued using interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could sense that at least a dozen people were chasing him, all at the level of Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, and even Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Back then, when Agatha was being hunted, it was the same kind of scene!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I need to find a large enough Chrono-Spatial Turbulence first! Only Chrono-Spatial Turbulence can mask my aura and stop them from chasing me! Otherwise, even though I have spatial power and am hard to catch, they won't give up easily, and it'll turn into a war of attrition!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The most important thing is, I might get surrounded by someone taking a detour!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After thinking, Osborne shot off in one direction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He planned to find the location of the Warfare Ancient Tree. Back then, to help Agatha shake off her pursuers, he jumped into an extremely powerful Chrono-Spatial Turbulence. Not only did he lose the pursuers, but he also entered a hidden place and discovered the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, Osborne decided to use the same tactic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, that Chrono-Spatial Turbulence was quite a distance from here. Even with spatial power, it would take Osborne some time to reach it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Osborne's expression suddenly changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sensed a strong threat rapidly approaching from behind, now already quite close to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This shocked Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How is this possible! I'm using spatial power to travel. Even if I'm not going all out, my speed is unmatched! Even an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection can't surpass me! They can only follow my aura and chase me all the way!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How could anyone catch up to me so quickly?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but turn his head, activating Satan's Eye to the limit, and immediately saw the person rapidly chasing him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection!</span></p><div class="pagination">
