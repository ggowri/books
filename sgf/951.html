  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, First led all the members of the Blood Demon organization out of the conference room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson opened his mouth, but no words came out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon was Osborne's private army; no one could command them except for him. Wesson had no authority to persuade or order them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the members had left, Serena frowned and turned to Wesson. "Shouldn't we stop them? They're strong, but going head-to-head with the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>? They'll be slaughtered!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson sighed heavily. "Stop them? I wish I could, but how? Did you see their faces? They're ready for a fight. If I try to hold them back from confronting the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> or rescuing Osborne, they'd probably take me out first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena fell silent at that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson's expression turned grave. "For now, we have to leave them be. Even if they're not a match for the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, it won't be easy for the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> to wipe them out. Right now, they're a pack of relentless killers. Even Gerardo would think twice before confronting them directly; he'd likely send others to wear them down instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What we need to focus on is finding the former Godfather! Gerardo has taken Osborne, and only the former Godfather can save him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mobilize all our intelligence networks. We need to find the former Godfather's whereabouts, and fast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, on Shame Island, Osborne was still attempting to communicate with the Blood Cross, hoping to harness its power to break free from the God Binding Rope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, after a full day of effort, he had made no progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of the God Binding Rope was simply too formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the door to the small cabin swung open again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George walked in with a mocking smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took one look at Osborne and raised an eyebrow in surprise. "What the hell? How is it possible that you're already healed? That's some serious recovery ability you've got! Your powers are sealed by the God Binding Rope, and yet you've managed to bounce back from such severe injuries in just one day?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder Mr. Aniston didn't want me to kill you. Seems like he's taken a shine to your physical talents."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Afraid Gerardo might notice my potential and take me on as his disciple, threatening your position?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shot George a scornful look, continuing, "I've heard tales of Gerardo's disciples, each one supposedly gifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But seeing you in person? I'm disappointed. If someone like you can be one of Gerardo's disciples, it's clear his standards are laughably low&mdash;probably all trash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George's fury flared at Osborne's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you trying to piss me off? You think yesterday's little torture session was too easy on you? If that's the case, I'll be happy to change things up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, George launched into another round of torment, his power manifesting as burning whips that lashed against Osborne's body again and again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne met his gaze with a cold intensity, remaining silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more he endured without a sound, the angrier George became. Osborne's unwavering stare seemed to mock him, suggesting George lacked the strength to break him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, let's try something new today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George suddenly stopped, realizing that his current method of torture was ineffective.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George smirked, opened the iron cage, and dragged Osborne out, leading him into the nearby jungle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far into the trees, they came upon several large iron cages, each one containing a battered individual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know who they are?" George asked, a sinister grin spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George sneered, not waiting for Osborne to respond before continuing, "They're all elite fighters from the Draco Armed Services Branch, Class AAA level. Unfortunately, they're all prisoners of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Thirty-six cages! Are there really thirty-six Class AAA warriors from the Draco Armed Services Branch?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And they are still alive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you bring me here for?" Osborne asked coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George laughed mockingly. "You're Sebastian's heir, aren't you? These guys were supposed to be under your command. I bet you don't want to see them die, do you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's play a little game of cat and mouse! This island is about two miles wide, dense with jungle. I'll let you hide first, but if I find you even once, I'll kill one of them right in front of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned in closer, a gleam in his eye. "And we'll keep this going until they're all dead! So, if you want to save their hides, you'd better find a good place to hide yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, George released Osborne, grinning wickedly. "You've got thirty minutes to find a spot. After that, I'll come looking for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face turned a deep shade of fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "My powers are sealed. Where could I possibly hide on this island? George has top-tier Class AAA strength; he could find me with his eyes closed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And once he does, he'll just kill one of the prisoners in front of me? How utterly despicable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got twenty-nine minutes left!" George taunted.</span></p><div class="pagination">
