  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, Leroy, and Clara were resting, as were Brenda and her team.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone was looking at Brenda with admiration.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She gave a </span><span>slight</span><span> smile, clearly enjoying their admiring gazes. These contestants were all prodigies from various states of Eastern Zone 3, and most of them came from First-rate Powers. Each one of them was extremely proud.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, a large portion of these people had already been won over by her strength and methods.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That day, she used the Golden Dragon Eye to locate three Ice Beetle nests.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, the others also alerted a swarm of bugs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, that day they destroyed a total of four Ice Beetle nests, with each swarm varying in size. In the end, they wiped out </span><span>a total of 120,000 Ice Beetles</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to the distribution plan, Brenda could claim 50%, which meant 60,000 Ice Beetles. She felt quite exhilarated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "60,000 Ice Beetles can be exchanged for 1.2 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints! And this is just one day's haul! This is already enough for me to win the championship! But it's still far from enough! I need to earn even more Kingdom Duel Scorepoints."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The treasury of the Glorious Divine Kingdom isn't something you can easily access! This time, I must exchange for some truly valuable treasures from there!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she stood up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Have you all rested well? If so, then let's move on! Because of the Magma Devourer, this zone duel has turned into complete chaos. I suspect that once the Magma Devourer is dealt with, the zone duel will end immediately."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, we can't waste any more time!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Today, we must take down more Ice Beetles and collect more loot to exchange for Kingdom Duel Scorepoints! It's not easy for us to participate in a zone duel. I hope everyone can return with full rewards!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Brenda finished speaking, everyone else immediately stood up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They completely obeyed her words. After all, her strength and skills were impressive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They set off again, continuing to search for Ice Beetles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Magma Devourer had already reached the edge of the glacier region.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling the low temperature here, it seemed a bit restless and angry. It didn't like this place because it made it uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even its strength was suppressed and affected. It couldn't exert its full power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The energy it consumed was also hard to recover.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, at this moment, Magma Devourer hesitated. It didn't know whether to enter the glacier region to continue hunting those who stole its Beast Soul Flower.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Gerald and the others caught up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the number of judges decreased again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only about sixty people were left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They battled with Magma Devourer for three days, preventing it from harming the contestants, but they also lost nearly half of the judges.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, every judge's eyes were bloodshot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Too many of their companions had died at the hands of Magma Devourer, which completely enraged them. They had given their all and vowed to eliminate Magma Devourer entirely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Gerald had lost his composure at this point, extremely furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He held the Sacred Artifact, pointed at Magma Devourer, and growled, "Magma Devourer, you have nowhere to run!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's fight again!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Magma Devourer turned and gave him a disdainful glance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It let out a roar that echoed through the skies. Even the void cracked in fragments, as if warning Gerald and the others to get lost.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this didn't scare Gerald; it only made him angrier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You killed so many of us. You must die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Gerald took the initiative to attack. They could all feel that after Magma Devourer approached the glacier area, its strength weakened, and even its recovery speed slowed down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, this was their chance!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud bang, the battle erupted fiercely once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The number of judges decreased, but the situation turned around instead. Magma Devourer could no longer deal with them easily; it even started getting injured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blood began to flow from its body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To be more precise, it wasn&rsquo;t blood but a substance resembling magma.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And this enraged the Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the ruler of Abyssal Planet, it had never faced such provocation. Instantly, it retaliated more ferociously. Unknowingly, their battle had moved into the glacier region. Glaciers shattered one after another.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Here, the Magma Devourer&rsquo;s power was even more suppressed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, its intelligence was low.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it were a normal person, in such a situation, it would immediately leave the glacier region, return to an area more suitable for their battle, or even head back to the volcanic region where its power could multiply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the Magma Devourer had no such awareness at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It had no idea that its power was being suppressed in the glacier region. It never thought about leaving. Being injured only made it angrier, more determined to kill Gerald and the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And its outburst was indeed powerful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald and the others could injure the Magma Devourer, but they still couldn't eliminate it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Lead it deeper into the glacier region!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Gerald suggested, "This beast is so stupid! It doesn't know that the glacier region suppresses its power! We keep provoking it, leading it deeper into the glacier region, and its power will be suppressed even more."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, it will be our chance to kill it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words excited the other judges. They immediately took action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With their coordination, the foolish Magma Devourer, roaring continuously, was lured deeper into the glacier region.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The scales of victory in the battle finally began to tilt toward Gerald and the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Magma Devourer suffered more and more injuries.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its blood melted the glacier and alarmed more and more Ice Beetles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, no one paid attention to these tiny bugs at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Deeper in the glacier region, Osborne fed Flash a Beast Soul Flower.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Flash, take them out!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After eating the Beast Soul Flower, Flash let out an excited dragon roar. Then he unleashed a blue Dragon's Breath, freezing all the Ice Beetles into ice lumps.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne easily collected them all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Another fifty thousand Ice Beetles!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne showed a bright smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Abyssal Planet is truly rich! Ice Beetles can be used for medicine and also help beings below the Supernal Deity King Level improve their cultivation level! That's why one Ice Beetle is worth two thousand Kingdom Duel Scorepoints."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And the Ice Beetles here are practically endless! The rewards from killing them are even better than mining directly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne almost didn&rsquo;t want to leave this place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he knew it was impossible!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's likely that the Glorious Divine Kingdom has no idea there are so many Ice Beetles here, let alone that he can eliminate them so easily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, the Glorious Divine Kingdom would never have opened Abyssal Planet as the battlefield for their zone duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Maybe the zone duel is about to end."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne suddenly turned his head to look behind him, his expression a mix of seriousness and anticipation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Magma Devourer has entered the glacier zone!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
