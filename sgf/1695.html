  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chose to resurrect himself 60 miles away, the maximum distance allowed within Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had been outside its bounds, he could have returned to life from 60 thousand miles away</span><span> and</span><span> ensur</span><span>ed</span><span> a far safer escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But here, he had to make do with the limited distance. Fortunately, after his resurrection, Osborne encountered no further danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed the Shadow Terror Fiend truly believed him to be dead and did not return. Without a moment's hesitation, he set off toward the outskirts of Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until he was well clear of its confines, Osborne couldn't relax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Shadow Terror Fiend was far too powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't shake the feeling that even if he became a true Deity King, he would still be no match for the Shadow Terror Fiend. Without his immortal body, he would have surely perished at its hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>H</span><span>is</span><span> brow furrow</span><span>ed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of being </span><span>was </span><span>the Shadow Terror Fiend, anyway?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And what about Lord Malevolence? He survived that creature's attack, albeit badly wounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's terrifying</span><span>. It was </span><span>beyond anything </span><span>he could </span><span>comprehend right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His earlier bravado, fueled by his rapid power gains, faded as he reflected on his narrow escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt immense gratitude for having restored the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity before encountering the Shadow Terror Fiend, granting him his immortality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was also relieved that the Shadow Terror Fiend seemed devoid of intelligence</span><span> and</span><span> fai</span><span>led</span><span> to realize he hadn't truly died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, he might not have escaped at all and would have met a permanent end within Divine Peak Nine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine Peak is definitely too dangerous! But risk and reward go hand in hand. This time, my gains from Divine Peak Nine have been monumental! I've achieved all my goals and acquired a treasure trove of Essence Crystals and even Celestial Crystals. I won't be short on resources for a long time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, I need to get out of here fast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I won't venture into Divine Peak's territory again anytime soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a firm resolve, Osborne plotted his next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next up, I need to take full control of the Ninth Dark Deity Legion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glint of determination flashed in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a short while, Osborne finally crossed the boundary of Divine Peak Nine and </span><span>felt a wave of relief wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I made it out alive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, back to the Divine Peak Nine base! There are over 400 thousand elite warriors from the Ninth Dark Deity Legion waiting for me. I need to find a way to control them all discreetly. With Angelo's assistance, it shouldn't be too hard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hurried back to the base, and as he approached, he released Angelo, Edison, and the others from the Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian, Anastasia, and Diana also emerged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian asked, and concern etched on his face, "Osborne, are you okay?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana told us about the Shadow Terror Fiend. We were all worried sick about you, but thank goodness you're safe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stared at Osborne in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was alive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After facing the Shadow Terror Fiend's attack, he not only survived but appeared completely unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her shock was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone who had encountered the Shadow Terror Fiend had perished, except for Lord Malevolence, who had barely survived the encounter, sustaining serious injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here was Osborne, completely unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana thought, "Could it be that the legends surrounding the Shadow Terror Fiend are exaggerated? Is it really not as powerful as everyone claims?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reassured them, "Don't worry, everyone! I'm fine! We've made it out of Divine Peak Nine, so we're safe for now. But I still have a lot on my plate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, Anastasia, you two should stay in the Dimensional Microcosm and keep cultivating. With the Celestial Crystals we have, your potential will increase again. I hope you both break through to become Deity Kings soon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The situation for the Human Community is getting more perilous by the day. The Paramount Supreme Clan could summon the Dark Deity Legion to attack the West Zone at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need to strengthen our power quickly so we can support the West Zone! Once I wrap up things here, we'll head over to help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sounds good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After chatting for a bit longer, they returned to the Dimensional Microcosm to continue their training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the Dimensional Microcosm, the atmosphere was almost sacred, filled with denser energy than even Divine Peak Nine. With plenty of Celestial Crystals at their disposal, they just needed to focus on their cultivation, and breaking through to Deity King status would be within reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Osborne, he had more pressing matters to attend to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "I need to get the Ninth Dark Deity Legion under control before I can leave the East Zone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa, Clarissa, just hang tight for me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'll be joining you in the West Zone soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Angelo. "What I need you to do next requires your cooperation. Once you return, follow this plan..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne laid out his strategy for Angelo, who nodded vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Lord, you can count on me! I know exactly what to do. But there are three Deity Kings at the base. They might cause some trouble..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked. "Three Deity Kings? Then let's take control of them first!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
