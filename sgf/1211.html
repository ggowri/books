  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of contemplation, Osborne spoke with determination, "Of course, we're going to support Hearin City!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even though it's the Deschanel family's territory and we've had our differences, we </span><span>can't just stand by and watch as the city is destroyed. We can't let 30 million innocent lives fall victim to the Beast Tide!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I can't help but wonder, why hasn't the Deschanel family reached out for our help in this situation? Is it just pride?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are they really willing to let Hearin City be ravaged just to save face? That doesn't add up..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian replied calmly, "Perhaps the Deschanel family thinks that even if we step in, it won't make much of a difference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe they underestimate our strength."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh..." Osborne paused, rubbing his nose thoughtfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's certainly a possibility. After all, our power has only surged recently! But whatever the case, I'll figure it out when I get there. I'm heading out now with the Blood Demon members to face the Beast Tide!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Beast Tide had already breached Hearin City, wreaking havoc and slaughtering civilians by the second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every moment he delayed meant more lives lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearin City, the financial heart of Rosmandi, was more vibrant than Newport City, filled with towering skyscrapers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet now, those very buildings were crumbling under the relentless assault of the Beast Tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chaos and terror gripped the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onslaught began from the west, where countless Ferocious Beasts surged into the city, killing on sight and destroying everything in their path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the hundreds of thousands of brave souls standing their ground at the front lines, Hearin City would have already fallen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sounds of battle echoed through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those on the front lines, numbering in the hundreds of thousands, faced an overwhelming force of beasts that numbered in the millions. They were being pushed back relentlessly, suffering casualties every moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them were warriors from various Ancient Families and wealthy clans in Hearin City, but the majority were ordinary people who had only awakened their powers three months ago due to the surge of energy in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they had only begun to harness their powers recently, some had already reached Class C and even Class B.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just three months ago, such a feat would have been unimaginable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, with the current energy levels, this rapid advancement had become the norm. Once they hit Class A, the pace of their growth would slow down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, there wasn't a single warrior from the Deschanel family&mdash;the supposed rulers of Hearin City for thousands of years and the second-ranked Ancient Family in Rosmandi&mdash;visible among the defenders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given those new trainers' strength, how could they possibly hold back such a terrifying Beast Tide?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were being pushed back, and lives were being lost, but at least new volunteers </span><span>were joining the fight, bolstering their ranks. Without that influx of support, they would have crumbled long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the front lines, a bloodied brute roared in fury, his voice booming over the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where the hell are the Deschanel family? Why aren't they here yet?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the Deschanel family doesn't step in soon, Hearin City is going to be wiped out by this Beast Tide! We're all going to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This furious man was the head of the Bush family, one of the Ancient Families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His anger boiled over as he realized that despite the lengthy onslaught of the Beast Tide, the Deschanel family&mdash;who claimed dominance over Hearin City&mdash;had yet to send a single expert to stem the tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have the Deschanel people already fled Hearin City?" he muttered incredulously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Around him, the faces of other members from Ancient Families and wealthy clans reflected their own growing dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone shouted in desperation, "We can't hold them off any longer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, amid the chaos, another one shouted, spurring the others on, "Everyone, hold on just a bit longer! We've got the Augustine family from Newport City. They're the top Ancient Family in Rosmandi, and they'll be sending help to reinforce our defenses against the Beast Tide!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Behind us are 30 million citizens of Hearin City! If we can't hold this line, they'll be engulfed by the Beast Tide and become fodder for these damn Ferocious Beasts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, let's give it everything we've got!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others echoed his rallying cry, fighting with reckless abandon against the relentless Beast Tide. Fire, earth, and wind elemental powers swirled in the air, hurling spells at the surging mass of beasts crashing down upon them like an unstoppable tsunami.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the sheer disparity in strength couldn't be masked by their fervent bravery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, the Beast Tide was unrelenting in its ferocity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The total number of beasts had to be well over a million, with more than 100 thousand Dark Exotic Beasts among them. And, out of these, over 10 thousand were Class S!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could the Ancient Families, the wealthy, and the common folk of Hearin City possibly withstand such a formidable onslaught?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearin City was crumbling fast.</span></p><div class="pagination">
