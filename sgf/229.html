  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, so this is what space feels like!" Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he swung his hand, and out of nowhere, a rift tore open in the void ahead. It looked like a gateway to hell, sending chills down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne knew better. This wasn't a portal to some infernal realm; it was merely a slice through space, revealing a chaotic expanse behind it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no air, no time, no matter&mdash;nothing at all. If someone were to be swallowed by that dimensional rift, it would mean certain death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only those who wielded spatial power could navigate through such treacherous territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With another wave of his hand, Osborne opened a dimensional rift several dozen yards away. He hesitated for a moment, then took a deep breath and stepped into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he vanished, only to reappear moments later through another rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne exclaimed, a grin spreading across his face, "Now, this is interdimensional travel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad my current strength only lets me tear open space within a hundred yards. I guess I'm stuck with this limited range for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still, it's perfect for ambushing or dodging a critical hit. And let's be honest if Orion hadn't been so cocky; I might've had a tough time dealing with him while he was hell-bent on escaping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I become a Class B or even a Class A master, just imagine being able to rip apart space over a greater distance! One thought, and I could travel from </span><span>Mayby</span><span> City to </span><span>Cloudsea</span><span> City in the blink of an eye!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a wave of satisfaction wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm still just a Class C+, though. My power level is too low for large-scale spatial tears. That Dimensional Collapse technique Orion used? I won't be able to pull that off until I reach Class B."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After experimenting a bit, he was thoroughly impressed with the spatial elemental power he had gained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this ability, his combat style would become far more unpredictable and versatile. His survival tactics would be significantly enhanced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, Osborne could now create a Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like having an invisible pocket where he could stash things away, ready to retrieve them whenever he needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a Class C+, the size of his Dimensional Space was limited&mdash;about the size of a small car&mdash;but it was more than enough for storing spare clothes and weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced at the items left behind by Orion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flick of his wrist, everything except a large iron chest vanished, neatly tucked away in his Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, it was time to cover his tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion was the heir of the ancient Lark family, so they had placed immense value on him, especially since he had unlocked the rare spatial power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Lark family discovered Orion's demise at his hands, trouble would come knocking at his door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew the Lark family wouldn't rest until they had their revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Osborne wasn't particularly worried, he preferred to avoid unnecessary complications. He needed to dispose of the body, leaving no traces behind that could lead back to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For someone like Osborne, erasing evidence was a walk in the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tore open space again, creating a dimensional rift that swallowed Orion's body whole. In an instant, Orion was gone from this world, leaving not even a whisper behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next up were Orion's subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once that was taken care of, he returned to the large iron chest and opened it, eager to inspect the statue of the Sacred Sorceress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, this statue looks just like Clarissa! The only difference seems to be the aura it gives off. The Sacred Sorceress is half divine, half sinister, with wings that are half snow-white and half pitch-black."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne reached out, touching the statue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strange, powerful energy thrummed within it, but he couldn't tap into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could this statue be linked to Clarissa in some way? I won't be able to use it, so I might as well take it back for her to study."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waved his hand, sending the iron chest into Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time to head back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He found his hidden vehicle and drove along the winding path back to </span><span>Mayby</span><span> City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, he reached out to Debbe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Lewis, could you discreetly spread a little gossip among the high society in </span><span>Cloudsea</span><span> City for me? I need everyone to know that Orion is dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He tried to marry Clarissa but couldn't handle her fate power. It backfired, and he suffered divine retribution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, make sure you're careful. We don't want anyone tracing the source of this news, or it could become a real mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks a lot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Killing Orion wasn't a complete fix for Clarissa's issues. Even without Orion, there would be other suitors knocking on the Radcliffe family's door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, no matter how skilled, couldn't go around eliminating every potential competitor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he needed was to create a buzz.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He intended to link Orion's death with Clarissa's fate power, making everyone believe that marrying Clarissa was a perilous endeavor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone who even entertained the idea without the proper power could face severe backlash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion was merely a cautionary tale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "I'll soon find out if this strategy works. If it doesn't scare off the others, then I'll have to start eliminating them one by one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He soon returned to the Radcliffe Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once back in his room, he retrieved the large iron chest containing the Sacred Sorceress statue from Dimensional Space. At first light, he went straight to find Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, I have a little something special I'd like to give you."</span></p><div class="pagination">
