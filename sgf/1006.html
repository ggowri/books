  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin was hurled back once again. Even though he fought with every ounce of strength, the relentless onslaught from nearly a thousand attackers overwhelmed him, forcing him to splatter blood across the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the real casualty was Crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crimson was already seriously injured from Osborne's previous attack; if it weren't for her tenacious vitality, she would have surely died countless times by now. Despite Sin's desperate attempts, he couldn't completely protect her from the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crimson was rocked by another devastating blow, more blood and shredded internal organs spewing from her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vitality in her eyes dimmed rapidly, slipping away like sand through her fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her condition ignited a furious rage within Sin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for death!" Sin roared, fixing a murderous glare on Osborne and the </span><span>Lambert family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Lambert family wasn't daunted. They continued with attacks, determined to end him once and for all. Hundreds of strikes covered Sin, overwhelming him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin's fury erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!! If it's death you want, then I'll give it to you! Now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that declaration, an explosive power surged through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive Realm erupted from Sin, crashing forth like a tidal wave, scattering every attack aimed at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a Plant Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Plant Realm enveloped an area spanning a mile, filled with towering trees and massive vines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trees and vines had come alive, writhing and twisting in a frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!" Sin growled, commandeering the enormous vines and roots to lash out at Osborne, Greyson, and the rest of the Lambert family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each vine stretched over a hundred yards long, snapping towards them with terrifying speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne became the prime target of Sin's wrath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half of those daunting vines and roots barreled straight toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He summoned his martial art aura, bracing for the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even that couldn't prepare him for the deluge of strikes to come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His martial art aura vibrated violently. While a single vine couldn't break his defenses, hundreds raining down in a row were another story. No matter how strong his aura, it couldn't withstand such a barrage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a nightmare!" Osborne thought, his expression darkening, dread settling in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had seen the devastation of Scarlett's Plant Realm, but what Sin showed was much stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a Level Four Realm!" He realized, recognizing the monumental power it held.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His own Light Realm was at Level Four, but Sin's Plant Realm dwarfed it in strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, Sin's mastery was beyond Osborne's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, he was up against someone else's Level Four Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne was struggling to defend it, let alone the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greyson and Roy were both sent flying by the monstrous vines and roots while blood erupted from their mouths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Lambert family banded together, dozens, even hundreds, working together to block a single root or vine. But they were still overpowered. Some bled like fountains and others even burst under the strain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Sin's Realm inflicted catastrophic losses on the Lambert family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was etched with horror as he witnessed the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne yelled, urgency in his voice, "Everyone, give everything you've got! "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold nothing back! Now! We need to shatter his Realm immediately, or we'll all die here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that taking down Sin's Level Four Realm by himself was impossible&mdash;he could only rely on the strength of the Lambert family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trusting Osborne's command, the members of the Lambert family sprang into action without a second thought. Some even abandoned their defenses to bombard Sin's Plant Realm with attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many among them went a step further and tried to detonate their own realm in a desperate bid to break through Sin's defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Osborne decided it was time to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, he unleashed three Realms in one time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Domain! Thunder Realm! Spirit Realm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he detonated them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force erupted like a thunderclap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With nearly a thousand fighters joining together, complemented by dozens of Realms exploding all at once, Osborne was convinced Sin's Level Four Plant Realm couldn&rsquo;t bear it and had to crumble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, an icy grip of horror seized him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his utter shock, despite the violence of the blast, Sin's Level Four Plant Realm still held firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?!" </span></p><div class="pagination">
