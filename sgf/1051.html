  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo barked orders, and the team sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some scoured the base, while others bolted outside, searching the surrounding area for any trace of the vanished Human Slaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo frowned in frustration, "How the hell did this happen?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no sign of spatial fluctuations here. How could hundreds of people just disappear in an instant? Who has that kind of power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mood darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo felt an overwhelming urge to vent his rage on someone, anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed on the doctors, fury radiating from him. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Though you had nothing to do with this, they vanished right under your watch! You useless fools should pay for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo raised his hand. Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the doctors' bodies swelled, then exploded. Blood and flesh splattering across the nearby cultivation tanks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't even have a chance to plead for mercy before they were gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Gerardo's anger didn&rsquo;t fade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hundreds of Human Slaves were missing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo didn't give a damn about the others. He could always create more later. He didn&rsquo;t even care about the missing Lord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Osborne&rsquo;s missing that angered him most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's level of enslavement had reached 92%. He was on the verge of becoming Gerardo's most powerful Human Slave weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, he vanished!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't count your chickens before they hatch?" Gerardo seethed, his anger boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had poured countless resources into Osborne&mdash;top-tier culture solutions, rare herbs, even the heart's blood of deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he couldn't even recreate another one of the top-tier culture solution!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne disappeared, taking all that precious energy with him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to get Osborne back!" Gerardo thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was unable to bear the loss, nor losing control of physically enhanced Osborne, </span><span>with a strength level of 200 and a potential to use that against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "I create a beast against me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damn it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I need him back! I have to!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was gloomy as he waited for the news from his subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Aniston, how could this happen?" Ophelia finally spoke up, her voice tinged with genuine astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was truly confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "I just saved Osborne. Why did all the Human Slaves vanish? What on earth happened here after I left with him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who has the power to quietly whisk away hundreds of people?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chill ran down her spine as she thought of this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like there were secret, terrifying eyes watching her every move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo scoffed as an answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He, too, was in the dark. At first, he had suspected Ophelia, thinking she might have used her time power to rescue Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after considering her abilities, he quickly dismissed the possibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's time power was indeed formidable, but at Class AAA, she wouldn't be able to secretly took hundreds of people away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even if she broke through to Class S!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo thought, "So, who could it be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>" Your Majesty: No traces found at headquarters!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>" Your Majesty: No traces around two miles!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's anger fueled as his subordinates delivered the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's unacceptable! Keep searching! Hundreds of people can't just vanish into thin air; there has to be a trace! You must find them!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he fired off his orders, he couldn't hold back his rage any longer. Gerardo had to be out there searching himself&mdash;there was no way he would allow Osborne to slip away. Even if it meant killing Osborne, he could never let Osborne go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Class AAA Osborne, already boasting a strength of 200, broke through to Class S, what kind of monstrous power might he had then?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could be more formidable than Gerardo when he fused with a god&rsquo;s body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While that didn't guarantee Osborne's strength would surpass his own, Osborne would undoubtedly become a big threat&mdash;an obstacle in Gerardo's quest for revenge against Sebastian and his plan to reclaim </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Find him!" Gerardo yelled as he charged out the door, his mind racing as he scanned the surroundings for any clues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, he arrived at a hidden cave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia, trailing behind him, felt her blood run cold as she realized where Gerardo was staring at the very cave where she had hidden Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could say anything to stop, Gerardo stormed into the cave, and despair washed over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Has he discovered everything?" Ophelia thought, biting down on her lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia steeled herself and followed him inside.</span></p><div class="pagination">
