  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? What do you mean? I'm offering you freedom, and you're not interested?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew looked at Osborne in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure? You won't regret it? If you don't want to go, I'm leaving!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew made a move to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know that Osborne, even in the dungeon, had seen everything that had happened to the Augustine family. He thought Osborne knew nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly and made an invitation gesture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "If you want to leave, then go ahead! But if I don't go out, the Augustine family will lose this bet for sure!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Osborne finished speaking, Matthew's face turned pale, and he looked at Osborne in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You, what did you say? Bet?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know what's happening outside? That's impossible! You're in the dungeon. Who could tell you what's happening outside? Could it be that you can really predict the future?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, pretending to be mysterious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right, I can predict the future! I foresee that the Augustine family is in big trouble. A powerful family of divine descendants from Yalynch will challenge us, the Augustine family, to a duel at Godfather's birthday banquet. The stakes will be two divine artifacts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In my prediction, the Augustine family will lose badly! Only Emma will shine. The rest of the Augustine family are no match for those Godson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the end, no one in the Augustine family will even dare to step on the stage!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I also predict that you will come to the dungeon to beg me to fight for a glimmer of hope!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder if my predictions are correct?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, Matthew's jaw dropped, his face full of shock. His eyes held a mix of admiration, fear, and other complex emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You, you can actually foresee the future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew's expression turned serious. "In your prophecy, is there any way for the Augustine family to resolve this predicament? Is there any way to turn the situation around?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course there is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, pointing to himself. "The key to turning the situation around is me! As long as you can persuade me to leave this dungeon and participate in this gamble, the Augustine family still has a glimmer of hope to win."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew was stunned once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The reason I wanted you to fight was that I thought if you took action, at least we, the Augustine family, wouldn't lose so badly! Are you sure there's still a chance to win?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged. "You can choose not to believe it, but that's the result of my prophecy. To be honest, I also think it's difficult to win even if I fight, after all, the opponent still has four Godsons."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's too difficult for me to defeat those four Godsons alone! I don't even think it's possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But in my prophecy, that's the outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want to go up there and get beaten up, you should just leave. It's no big deal if we lose."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Osborne made a gesture of seeing him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Matthew was unwilling to leave. At this point, he ultimately believed that Osborne could foresee the future. Otherwise, there was no way to explain how Osborne, locked in the dungeon, knew what was happening to the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bit his lip and said, "What do you want in order to fight for the Augustine family? Don't forget, you are also a member of the Augustine family's branch bloodline. If the Augustine family is humiliated, you won't feel good either, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly. "What does that have to do with me? I also want to fight for the Augustine family, but someone locked me in this dungeon for a whole month! What can I do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not locking you up anymore, I'm asking you to come out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew said urgently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile. "As I said, you can't just lock me up and let me go as you please. It's not that simple."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew froze, finally understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was asking for benefits!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or rather, compensation...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sighed helplessly, "Just say it straight, what do you want? As long as you're willing to leave this place and fight for the Augustine family, I'll do my best to satisfy you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes finally lit up at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said calmly, "How can I take your things? That would be extortion! Unless you offer them to me voluntarily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, I'll offer them to you voluntarily! Tell me, what do you like?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly said, "I want to be the Vice Captain of the Punishment Squad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vice Captain of the Punishment Squad?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew was stunned. "How can I give you that? I'm only the Vice Captain myself. At most, I can appoint you as my assistant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at him coldly. "You're the heir apparent of the Augustine family, and so am I. You want me to be your assistant? What a joke!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I can't help you either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew frowned. "The Vice Captain of the Punishment Squad needs to be personally appointed by Isaac. I have no way to do that. But I can promise you that I'll do my best to help you. There's about a 50% chance I can make you the Vice Captain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If, if you can turn the tide in today's gamble and help the Augustine family win, then I'll have a 100% chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne nodded in satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, it's a deal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne and Matthew high-fived to confirm and then quickly left the dungeon with Matthew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he stepped out of the dungeon, Osborne felt like he had been through a lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had only been locked up for a day, so much had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strength had also undergone earth-shattering changes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yalynch's Godson?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's finally my turn!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
