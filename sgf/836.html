  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent's fury was palpable as he glared at Osborne with a challenge in his eyes. Osborne, however, couldn't help but laugh.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There's no need for all this drama!" Osborne said with a smirk. "I'm in a hurry to find my sister and don't have time to waste here. I'll only make one move. If you can block it without being defeated, I'll leave the Augustine family and step down as the top heir immediately."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The room fell into stunned silence.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone, including Vincent, was taken aback by Osborne's audacity.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Caleb's face turned anxious.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, don't be reckless!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne shrugged calmly. "Caleb, I'm not being reckless."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent's eyes lit up with excitement.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, you said it yourself! We all heard you. If you're having second thoughts, no one in the Augustine family will ever respect you again!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne sneered. "Don't worry. I won't regret it, nor do I need to, because someone like you can't possibly withstand my single move!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent burst into laughter.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, you're out of your mind! Fine, let's see it. If you land a hit on me, I'll bow to you and show you respect from now on!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Vincent waved his hand, signaling everyone to step back, and prepared for his duel with Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's smile turned icy. "If you back out now, I'll break your legs."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Bring it on!" Vincent shouted, his aura surging as he braced himself with multiple layers of defense.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once ready, he looked at Osborne with contempt.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you ready?" Osborne asked, his tone unruffled and calm as he watched Vincent prepare.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's go! After this, you won't be the Augustine family's top heir anymore. Osborne, you're so full of yourself. You don't deserve..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Vincent could finish, Osborne was already in motion.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He appeared before Vincent in an instant and launched a powerful kick aimed at his chest. Osborne felt a rush of satisfaction, thinking his kick had the same finesse as Isa's renowned technique.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa's kick had always been a source of envy for Osborne, and now he was finally executing it himself.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Osborne's foot connected with Vincent's defenses, it cut through them like a needle piercing fabric, driving deep into Vincent's body.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent sneered, feeling the impact but completely unimpressed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Point Blank Force? That's laughable! Even if you've mastered it, so what? You think that little bit of power can actually hurt me?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne just smiled coldly, his eyes sharp.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Detonate!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that single thought, the energy that had pierced into Vincent's body suddenly erupted.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, Vincent was sent flying like a rag doll, launching hundreds of meters into the air before crashing into a solid rock.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Blood splattered along his path as his body tumbled to the ground in a twisted heap, trembling uncontrollably, completely unable to stand.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd fell into stunned silence.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their jaws dropped as they looked back and forth between the crumpled Vincent and Osborne, who calmly lowered his foot.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No one could believe it.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne had knocked Vincent flying with just one move. Judging by how much blood Vincent had coughed up, he was surely wrecked.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The silence broke with a sharp intake of breath from the crowd.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Vincent, you've lost." Osborne's voice was icy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let this be a warning. If you or anyone else dares to mess with the Augustine family of Dampston again, I don't care who you are, not even if you're the elder's grandson, I'll make you pay.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And next time you see me, you'd better bow. If not, I'll break both your legs."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Osborne finished speaking, Vincent, struggling to keep his head up, spewed another mouthful of blood before his eyes rolled back, and he collapsed into unconsciousness.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Vincent!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Vincent!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His supporters, panicked and terrified, rushed over to check on him while Nathan, Queenie, and others quickly surrounded Osborne, excitement and relief plastered across their faces.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That was incredible, Osborne! You really knocked him out with just one move. This is beyond satisfying!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"For so long, they've been strutting around, mocking you, saying you were no match for Vincent. But look at them now!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"They're all shocked!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"They must be kicking themselves!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Dampston branch members were practically buzzing with excitement, finally able to release the frustration they'd been holding in for so long.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne allowed them a moment to bask in their victory before raising his hand to silence them.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now's not the time to celebrate. Yulissa and Kendra are still missing. That's why I'm here."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The mood shifted instantly, and the crowd sobered, their expressions growing tense.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, we've searched every inch of the arena, but there's no sign of them."</p><div class="pagination">
