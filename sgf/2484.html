  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aaron listened, his eyes filled with anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It's one thing for Osborne to make me swear by the Divine Principle. But now, he even demands at least one Supreme Sacred Artifact as compensation?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Supreme Sacred Artifact, is that something easily obtainable?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had cultivated for tens of thousands of years, and as the deputy leader of Skyearth Dominion, he only possessed one Supreme Sacred Artifact, which was of a supportive type, not meant for attack or defense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even so, he had already far surpassed most beings at the Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, most Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection beings don't even have a single Supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's not because they can't afford it, but because Supreme Sacred Artifacts are far too rare, with almost every piece in the hands of renowned supreme warriors. These people lack no resources and naturally wouldn't sell their Supreme Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The only possible place to obtain a Supreme Sacred Artifact might be the treasury of the Glorious Divine Kingdom. But even there, entry qualification can only be exchanged with Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many people are willing to pay a high price for these Scorepoints, just for a chance to exchange for a Supreme Sacred Artifact from the treasury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even so, this path is still tough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, Supreme Sacred Artifacts are extremely rare and precious, and Aaron only owns one. Osborne demanding him to compensate with one made him particularly furious at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, when he saw Adriana beside Osborne, no matter how furious he felt inside, he didn</span><span>'</span><span>t dare show it, let alone explode.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could only endure the humiliation and appease, "Osborne, I truly apologize sincerely. I</span><span>'</span><span>m even willing to swear by the Divine Principle that I will never leak today</span><span>'</span><span>s matter, nor will I retaliate against you or cause you trouble in any form. But asking me to compensate with a Supreme Sacred Artifact is really difficult. I simply don</span><span>'</span><span>t have one."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How about this, I</span><span>'</span><span>ll figure something out and compensate you with five Legendary Sacred Artifacts? No, ten Legendary Sacred Artifacts! In terms of value, ten Legendary Sacred Artifacts are no less than one Supreme Sacred Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aaron's face revealed a fawning smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne sneered and said, "Ten Legendary Sacred Artifacts? It seems Vice Leader Aaron is indeed wealthy! In that case..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aaron was now staring excitedly at Osborne, thinking Osborne had agreed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in the next moment, Osborne said, "Since that's the case, my previous compensation request seems a bit too low. Now, I want not only one Supreme Sacred Artifact but also an additional three Legendary Sacred Artifacts! If you can't provide them, I'm afraid my anger will be hard to quell. In that case, I'll have no choice but to ask my master to deal with you directly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After killing you, I'll search your body. Who knows, I might find even more treasures?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne finished speaking and gave Adriana a meaningful glance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana smiled faintly and said, "That works too! Since he can't offer compensation that satisfies you, just deal with him and save the trouble."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, a faint aura of pressure emanated from her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aaron's face instantly turned pale with fear, full of terror. Sensing Adriana's subtle killing intent, he wished he could slap himself hard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He shouldn't have negotiated with Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, not only did Osborne reject his proposal, but he also demanded three more Legendary Sacred Artifacts as compensation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Worse still, he had no room to refuse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he refused, he would face Adriana's merciless strike.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Aaron's heart was filled with resentment toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's greed made him grit his teeth. He even wanted to tear Osborne to pieces or imprison him for centuries, even millennia, of torment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But as long as Adriana was by Osborne's side, no matter how angry he was, he dared not do anything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he could only lower his head and say dejectedly, "I'll pay! I'm willing to compensate!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne immediately showed a smug smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everything became simpler after that. Aaron stopped resisting or struggling and painfully took out his only Supreme Sacred Artifact, erasing his mark from it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, he handed this treasure along with three other Legendary Sacred Artifacts to Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "I swear by the Divine Principle, I will never disclose what happened today to anyone. Nor will I seek revenge against Osborne in any way. Otherwise, may my soul be utterly destroyed, never to reincarnate."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Aaron finished speaking, Osborne immediately noticed a slight ripple in the surrounding void.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And on Aaron, it seemed like something had been added.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this the Divine Principle responding?" Osborne murmured, filled with awe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he quickly set aside his doubts, his gaze fixed firmly on the four Sacred Artifacts Aaron offered as compensation, his eyes gleaming with excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A Supreme Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three Legendary Sacred Artifacts!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Supreme Sacred Artifact looked like a seal, its surface covered with intricate patterns, emitting a soft glow, roughly the size of a fist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other three Legendary Sacred Artifacts were a ring, a heavy hammer, and a pair of gauntlets.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get lost!" Adriana coldly said to Aaron, "If you dare trouble my disciple again, I won't need the Divine Principle to act&mdash;I will personally kill you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aaron's face was full of frustration. He glared fiercely at Osborne, then glanced at the four Sacred Artifacts in his hand, his heart filled with pain and unwillingness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, he suffered a huge loss.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only did he fail to take Osborne's Kingdom Duel Badge or retrieve the Ice Scepter, but he also lost his only Supreme Sacred Artifact along with three Legendary Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He really lost too much!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But even so, he didn</span><span>'</span><span>t dare say another word. After all, he was already considered lucky since Adriana didn</span><span>'</span><span>t kill him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he lowered his head and hurried away, quickly disappearing from sight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was only then that Osborne quickly thanked Adriana, "Ms. Alba, thank you for stepping in to save me! Without your help, I fear I would have been in big trouble today!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he handed the four Sacred Artifacts in his hand to Adriana without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana was a bit surprised as she looked at Osborne. "These are what Aaron compensated you with, and you're willing to give them all to me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a wry smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To be honest, he was indeed reluctant to part with these treasures, as they were Supreme Sacred Artifacts and Legendary Sacred Artifacts. Perhaps some of them suited him and could greatly enhance his strength. But he understood that he couldn't be greedy for them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He explained, "If it weren't for your help, let alone obtaining these Sacred Artifacts, I might not have even survived. So, I won't hesitate. These things rightfully belong to you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana heard this and gave a faint smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She took the four Sacred Artifacts, looked them over carefully, and then teased, "You just called me Master, and now you're calling me Ms. Alba?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne instantly felt a bit awkward, smiled, but said nothing more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright! It seems you're still unwilling to acknowledge me as your master," Adriana continued, "In that case, I won't force you. However, saving you was entirely my own choice, not for these things. So, these Sacred Artifacts should rightfully belong to you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop refusing. I absolutely won't take them! I don't need these things. Besides, I think having you owe me a favor is more valuable than these Sacred Artifacts."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He touched his nose and said with a wry smile, "I'm afraid you'll be disappointed. My favor probably isn't worth that much."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not now, of course," Adriana said with a faint smile, "but who knows about the future! I have high hopes for your potential. To be honest, back at Mystic Sirius Sect, I did underestimate you. Your potential is no less than Isa's, and it might even be greater. If I had known this earlier, I would have tied you up and taken you to Fairy Moon Sect no matter what!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, Adriana's fiery gaze fixed on Osborne, as if trying to see through his soul completely.</span></p><div class="pagination">
