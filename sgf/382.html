  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander suddenly raised his hand and pressed it on his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment but did not choose to transform into a Vampire. There were too many people around, and he didn't want to reveal too much of his strength. He just activated the Devil's Light and protected himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the level five Devil's Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a fusion of six elemental essences. In terms of attack and defense, it was extremely powerful, exceeding the power of a single elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne believed that with the protection of the Devil's Light and his strong body, Alexander couldn't hurt him easily, let alone kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought Alexander was giving him an ancient magic weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alexander's behavior made him somewhat confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander did not seem to be trying to mobilize the power of thunder and lightning. He just pressed his fingers on his forehead and covered the glowing lightning pattern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, Osborne felt a terrible aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The countless streaks of lightning around Alexander seemed to be frightened and quickly drilled into his body, and Alexander's fingers were glowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Exactly, it was the lightning pattern under his fingers that was emitting an intense light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come out! The Blessing of Thunder!" Alexander suddenly roared and took his hand off his forehead. Everyone was surprised to find that the lightning pattern on his forehead disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No! It didn't disappear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, it turned into a bolt of lightning, which was emitting a terrifying purple light in Alexander's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered and looked at Osborne with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, this is the blessing that God of Thunder gave me when I became a Class A Power Master! Now, feel the power of it!" After saying that, Alexander flicked his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the lightning shot toward Osborne and quickly grew larger in the air. The surrounding light seemed to be absorbed by it. The sky became dim. Only that streak of lightning was giving out light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a moment, it grew from the thickness of a finger to a terrifying bolt of lightning, piercing through the sky and striking down from above Osborne's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac's expression changed drastically. "No!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be careful, Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander lied!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is not his own power but the God of Thunder's! Get out of the way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac yelled in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne faced this horrifying lightning, and his mind went blank. He didn't hear Isaac's reminder at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had thought that Alexander's confidence came from his lack of understanding of his strength, so Alexander believed that he could kill him in a move with 30% of his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne finally realized that he was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's confidence came from the power of this strange lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, "The Blessing of Thunder?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The power of this lightning is so great that even if Alexander exerted all his strength, he would not be able to do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne actually dispersed the green Devil's Light around him and decided to use his body to bear the horrific lightning attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his action, everyone was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne actually gave up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He had no choice. This is the Blessing of Thunder. The power of this lightning is so strong that even a Class A Power Master cannot beat it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even for Isaac, it would be difficult for him to bear the attack, and he would at least be seriously injured."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne giving up his defense, Wade sneered in contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're going to die! The power of the Blessing of Thunder is powerful. Even I dare not bear it. How dare you take the bet? You are courting death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must be regretting it, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's too late to regret! The Blessing of Thunder has locked onto you, and there is no escape for you. As long as you are not a lightning-controlling metahuman, you will definitely die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Wade was speaking, the Blessing of Thunder fell on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All members of the Augustine family couldn't help but close their eyes, and their faces filled with grief. They didn't want to see the scene of Osborne's body being burned by the terrifying lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, something strange happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lightning fell on Osborne without making any sound, and his body was safe and sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't leave any marks on his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne even smiled as if what had just hit him was not lightning but warm water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened?" In an instant, the crowd was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought Osborne would be killed by lightning, but he was fine, and he even looked happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was at a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Alexander and Wade reacted and stared at Osborne in disbelief.</span></p><div class="pagination">
