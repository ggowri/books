  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mosley was utterly dumbfounded as she sensed the divine power radiating from Osborne's transformed leg bone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way... it actually worked!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her disbelief was palpable. With her blood energy nearly depleted and Osborne's leg bone now a Divine Bone, all her hopes were dashed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The transformation had rendered the amount of blood energy Osborne could absorb massive beyond measure. There was no way she could overwhelm him now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fury filled Mosley's eyes. "No! I refuse to accept this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After sleeping for countless years, waking up only to face a monster like you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't let you have it easy, even if it means my own death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair and madness flashed across Mosley's face as a terrifying force surged forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mental Collapse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice thundered through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mosley's primary power was psychic power, and with her realization that death was imminent, she had no choice but to unleash her most powerful mental attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Mosley's trump card, a desperate move that would strike her own soul with immense backlash, regardless of whether it harmed her enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had held back this final gambit as long as possible, but now, she was forced to use it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mental Collapse! Die, you wretch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a heartbeat, Osborne sensed an overwhelming danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he activated his Soul Barrier to shield his soul and mental strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, it felt as if his brain had been hammered with a colossal force. He felt as if thunderbolts were crashing through his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a blood-curdling scream, spat out a mouthful of blood, and was hurled backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face turned ghostly pale, fear gripping him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his formidable soul and mental strength, and his mastery over psychic power and Spirit Realm, Mosley's power made his defenses seem insignificant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without the Soul Barrier, her final assault would have easily shattered his soul and crushed his mental strength pool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if his body had survived, his soul would have been obliterated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank goodness! Thank god Isa taught me Soul Barrier. It deflected most of the attack aimed at my soul and mental strength, or I'd be dead already!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a shuddering breath, Osborne wiped the blood from his mouth and turned to look at Mosley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body had withered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood energy within her had been completely drained by Osborne, and her final desperate attack had inflicted severe damage on her own soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was on the brink of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mosley struggled to lift her head, her massive eyes filled with reluctance and fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But eventually, her enormous form collapsed with a resounding thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dark Deity Mosley was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her life force dwindled rapidly, and she ceased all movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, seeing this, let out a deep sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had finally won.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle had pushed him to use every trick in his arsenal, and it could be said that luck played a significant role in defeating Mosley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, victory was his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Exhausted, Osborne collapsed onto the ground, gasping for breath. It wasn't until some time had passed that he finally managed to stand and walk over to Mosley's massive corpse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "She was a deity after all. Even in death, her body is incredibly powerful! Especially her mouthpart. It's as tough as a Premium divine artifact and can absorb blood energy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps I could use it to create a divine artifact!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her wings and those serrated, long legs are also excellent materials for crafting divine artifacts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pondered for a moment before he waved his hand, storing Mosley's corpse in the Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he moved over to Kendra and Yulissa. After checking their conditions, he let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two seemed to be poisoned and had not yet regained consciousness, but their physical state was stable. It wouldn't be long before they woke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne then looked at his right leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it no longer glowed and appeared just like before, only Osborne knew that his right leg bone had now transformed into a Divine Bone, imbued with terrifying power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel the immense strength coursing through his right leg. It felt as if Osborne could kick a mountain out of his path without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, he even believed his leg could take on a regular divine artifact head-on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne took out the Rock Smasher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then delivered a powerful kick to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force unleashed was immense, and Osborne noticed the Rock Smasher seemed to have bent slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impressive!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
