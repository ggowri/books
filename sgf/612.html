  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melanie's actions piqued Osborne's curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It appeared that she was also a light elemental metahuman, but her approach differed </span><span>from that of both Gordon and Sene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chose not to interrupt her, eager to see her next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Melanie knelt and called out reverently, starlight began to gather above Arena Number One. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It then thickened into a river of stars that surged toward her, merging with her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Osborne's astonishment, Melanie gradually became transparent, transforming into a ray of light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Light Transformation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, Melanie let out a low roar, and her flesh and blood vanished, and she stood as a being of light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at Osborne with a sneer on her lips, which looked creepy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's finished!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Rosenthal family members sneered, watching Osborne with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He let Melanie complete her Light Transformation! Her body was completely transformed into light. He has already lost."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned. "Light Transformation? A light elemental power used like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melanie regarded him with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Light elemental power is a noble art, meant for the Divine Descents, filled with unimaginable power. How can a lowly person like you understand it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've been too arrogant, allowing me to finish the transformation! I'm now worthy of ranking among the top ten Godsons of </span><span>Yalynch</span><span>. You will fall to me because of your arrogance.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Melanie finished speaking, the Augustine family erupted in anger. They all glared at Osborne angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! I knew he was unreliable. He was already at a disadvantage, and now he pretends to be an expert, waiting for his opponent to be ready. Now he's done for."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's a being of light now! Ordinary attacks won't affect her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can he fight her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustration bubbled among the Augustine family. They were all blaming Osborne for the dire situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne ignored their complaints, focusing on Melanie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A being of light?" he murmured, sensing he could achieve the same transformation but refrained, not wanting to provoke the Rosenthal family further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want any more accidents to happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calmly, he challenged her. "</span><span>So</span><span> what if you're a being of light? Show me your power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, you&rsquo;ll see." Melanie sneered and suddenly moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body flashed, and she instantly appeared in front of Osborne and punched him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melanie completely transformed into a being of light, and her speed was as fast as real light. Almost no one could see her movements clearly, and her attack had already landed on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body shook. He instantly threw a punch at Melanie's body at the same fast speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his strike passed through her light form, causing no damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melanie didn't even dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smirked, "Loser! I've fully transformed into light. Your attacks can't harm me. You can't hurt me, but I can attack you. My power now surpasses my normal state. Aresta may not even match me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Melanie launched another flurry of attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her speed and attack were so fast that Osborne struggled to defend himself, relying on the martial art aura and Stretch Soft Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Melanie's overwhelming power broke through his defenses, her light form surrounding him and relentlessly striking at any weak point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, Osborne became a target, unable to counter her lightning-fast attacks. And blood seeped from the corners of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Rosenthal family wore cold smiles while the Augustine family looked on in despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Emma frowned at Melanie's relentless assault, contemplating how she would fare in Osborne's position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melanie, now a being of light, was immune to ordinary attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma realized that only spiritual attacks might penetrate her defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt that spiritual attacks were also invisible and intangible. Even if Melanie turned into light, she might not be immune to spiritual attacks. Only spiritual attacks could cause harm to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If those methods failed, Melanie would be invincible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Emma was about to warn him, Osborne moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold snort, he opened a Dimensional Space and pulled out a massive dark scythe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Death Sickle!</span></p><div class="pagination">
