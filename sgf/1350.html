  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, dozens of Junior Deities from the Pantheon League fell silent; their defiance extinguished as Osborne's mere glance instantaneously obliterated them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight was enough to terrify everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who had considered shouting insults at Osborne now saw their peers, warriors of comparable strength, meet their end with just a single glance. Fear quickly silenced any would-be challengers, and they clamped their mouths shut, realizing that Osborne was not someone to be trifled with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, the true powers of the Pantheon League could no longer stand idly by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You damned bastard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You come into our Pantheon League's Dimensional Microcosm and kill without a care! I don't care how the hell you got in here; you've got to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a group of over ten Superior Deities surged forward, their faces twisted with rage as they charged at Osborne with astonishing speed, closing the distance in a heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A simple glance wouldn't suffice against Superior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come at me then!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without warning, he exploded into action. The witnesses saw him casually kick out at the charging Superior Deities, and in that instant, the air was filled with the violence of destruction as their Divine Bodies detonated in a crimson cloud of gore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even a single kick could be withstood by those formidable warriors!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence fell over the arena&mdash;a deafening stillness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more than three thousand elite warriors of the Pantheon League stood frozen in shock, staring at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those were just a handful of Superior Deities, and they had fallen before him as if </span><span>they were nothing more than paper dolls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They mused, "How could this be? What kind of power was this? How could someone be so terrifying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear gripped the hearts of all present. They gazed wide-eyed at Osborne, hands clamped over their mouths, terrified to make a sound lest they draw his lethal gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, the lone Transcendent Deity warrior trembled violently, his terror directed straight at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The idea of obliterating Superior Deities with a single kick was beyond his capacity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he multiplied his strength tenfold, he could never achieve such a feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Could it be that this guy has meant what he said about making an example of me if I don't obey?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic-stricken, the Transcendent Deity warrior didn't dare move an inch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the death of the Superior Deities, an oppressive quiet settled over the crowd, and no one dared to challenge Osborne again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A satisfied smile crept onto Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"See? Was that so hard? You had to push me to make a display of power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd seethed with humiliation and dread, their unspoken fears echoing around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's gaze roamed over them, and wherever it landed, eyes widened in terror as they feared their bodies might explode without warning under his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, nothing more terrible happened this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued, "Now that I've introduced myself, I have some questions for you. Just be honest, and I promise I won't torture you. Otherwise, I'll make sure you experience true agony!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, the crowd shook with renewed trepidation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, it's unfortunate to break this news to you, but over a hundred of your Superior Deities and Transcendent Deity warriors who joined the Dark Deity Legion to wipe out the Lord League have failed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're all dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even your leader, Nelson, has fallen by my hand! So don't even think about trying to attack me or lying to me, because your fate will be far worse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he spoke, everyone fell into a stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? The leader is dead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"More than a hundred Superior Deities and Ancestors of the Transcendent Deity, all dead? How is that even possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't believe it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted into chaos, voices rising in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough! Quiet down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's cold snort cut through the noise, and a hush fell over the group once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, the sole Transcendent Deity warrior gathered his courage and spoke, his voice trembling, "What do you want to know? As long as you stop killing, I'll cooperate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anger and a deadly resolve flashed in Osborne's eyes as he gritted his teeth. "Smart move! I just want to understand some history. If you all play along, I might even spare </span><span>your lives!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced around, his gaze sharp and unyielding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone from the Hastings family, step forward! If I catch even one of you hiding among the crowd, I'll wipe out every last one of you here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear rippled through the audience at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They immediately turned their attention to a few individuals at the back, clearly members of the Hastings family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces paled, and they felt the weight of impending doom. They had the instinct to blend in, to disappear into the throng, but the other Divine Family members wouldn't allow that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, nearly a hundred people were reluctantly forced to step out from the crowd, their feet dragging as they did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched them with a growing fury, his intentions clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the gathered were the very individuals who had tormented his parents, those who had coerced them into the black vortex.</span></p><div class="pagination">
