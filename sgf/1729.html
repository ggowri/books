  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Supreme Malevolence Airship, a marvel engineered by the Artisan Institute, was the mightiest of its kind, not just for its speed and capability for simple interdimensional travel but also for its formidable defensive and offensive powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With enough Essence Crystals on the airship, even a Deity King warrior would struggle to breach its defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The firepower of its main and secondary cannons could easily shred the divine power defenses of any Deity Overlord warrior, even posing a threat to Deity Kings themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the Bowman family, Essence Crystals were never in short supply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, the four Supreme Malevolence Airships mounted a relentless assault from every direction, unleashing a tide of chaos upon the Mystic Feather Clan. This indiscriminate barrage wreaked havoc, resulting in staggering casualties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the floating mountain, nearly a million members of the Mystic Feather Clan stood their ground, but most were far from powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the onslaught of the Supreme Malevolence Airships, they had no means of defense. In an instant, countless lives were annihilated, their bodies torn apart and reduced to nothingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the various factions reacted quickly, raising their divine power barriers, their defenses could hardly withstand the overwhelming power of the Supreme Malevolence Airship's main cannon, which easily shattered their strongest shields.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground shook violently as screams and cries of agony filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich, Alfred, and the warriors of the Demonic Dragon Clan and the Soaring Lion Clan observed the carnage from the decks of the Supreme Malevolence Airships, their expressions icy and unyielding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, several powerful figures burst forth from the floating mountain, charging through the fierce attacks aimed at them, appearing just a stone's throw from the airships.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A scream came. "Why?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bowman family! Demonic Dragon Clan! Soaring Lion Clan! You really intend to annihilate the Mystic Feather Clan?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why! Why is this happening?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One formidable figure approached the Supreme Malevolence Airship</span><span> and </span><span>deliver</span><span>ed </span><span>a massive punch that struck with thunderous force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The airship's defenses faltered under the sheer power of the blow</span><span> and </span><span>shatter</span><span>ed</span><span> in catastrophic failure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the blink of an eye, a stronger divine power barrier surged into place</span><span> and</span><span> absorb</span><span>ed</span><span> the impact completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attacker was Maxime from the Mystic Feather Clan, while the defender was Aldrich from the Bowman family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich sneered at Maxime, "Want to know why? I've made it abundantly clear. Your Mystic Feather Clan has conspired with the Human Community to kill my son, Tobey! You're all guilty! Today, I, Aldrich, have been commanded to purge those who have betrayed the esteemed Lord Malevolence! You deserve nothing less than death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxime's eyes blazed with rage, and he could no longer restrain his fury toward Aldrich's demands for accountability. "You're talking nonsense! The Mystic Feather Clan has never colluded with the Human Community! We did not kill your son, and we certainly haven't betrayed the esteemed Lord Malevolence! You're spouting slander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a mocking smile, Aldrich retorted, "Just because you say so doesn't make it true! Who are you to question me? I'm from the Bowman family! If I say you've betrayed the esteemed Lord Malevolence, then it's a fact! Whether it's true or false is irrelevant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Mystic Feather Clan will all perish for your treachery! You will all pay for my son's death! Now, take them down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Continue the assault!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich ordered, and the four Supreme Malevolence Airships intensified their bombardment, while Deity Overlord warriors descended from the airships, ruthlessly charging toward the remaining Mystic Feather Clan members on the floating mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxime's rage boiled over, mixed with a profound regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He regretted not believing Raoul's warning in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxime, a prominent figure in the Lopez family</span><span>, </span><span>one of the strongest factions within the Mystic Feather Clan</span><span>, f</span><span>ound himself at the epicenter of the attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Supreme Malevolence Airships had fixated their firepower on them, </span><span>which </span><span>result</span><span>ed</span><span> in the highest casualties among his kin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His family members, his wife, his children, his grandchildren</span><span>, </span><span>all had fallen victim to the relentless onslaught of the airship's artillery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer rage coursing through him was palpable. He threw his head back and let out a primal scream. "Bowman family, I'll take you on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that declaration, Maxime charged forward, brimming with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich only sneered at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're looking for a death wish! You haven't even reached mid-stage Deity King yet, and you think you can challenge me? I'll personally escort you to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flick of his hand, Aldrich unleashed his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! The Mystic Feather Clan is finished!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get in on this too! Let's see who can kill more of those Mystic Feather pests!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air around the Supreme Malevolence Airships erupted with battle cries. Warriors from the Demonic Dragon Clan, the Soaring Lion Clan, and the Bowman family surged forth, abandoning their ships to rain down chaos upon the Mystic Feather Clan's floating mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While there were some warriors from Mystic Feather Clan resisting, the gap in strength was simply too wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the slaughter unfolded, Raoul trembled with fear and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's true! It's all true! Everything Hannah said was right! Thank goodness the Gellar family is safe inside Hannah's Dimensional Microcosm, or we..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought struck him like a lightning bolt, filling him with dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, witnessing the massacre of others around him ignited a fire in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't abandon them. He would not flee!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his heart pounding in his chest, Raoul shouted, "Kill!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
