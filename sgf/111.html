  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin's sudden outburst stunned the guards at the diamond dealing market. Her sharp slap left them momentarily dazed and speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intensity of her presence was overwhelming, as if she were a high-born princess scolding her subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Few could command such authority - certainly not Wesley, the heir of the Ashford family, who lacked Austin's commanding presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Montague family was far more powerful than the Ashford family, and Austin, being the sole heir of the Montague family, had been destined for her role from birth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley, on the other hand, faced fierce competition and only recently secured his position as heir, making his standing far less stable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guard who had been slapped mumbled, clutching his face in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fury was palpable, but he dared not show it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin smirked, saying, "You're not worthy of knowing my identity. Get out of my way, or I'll ensure that your diamond dealing market comes to a standstill!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then linked arms with Osborne, striding into the market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards, intimidated, made no move to stop them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they were inside, the lead guard hurriedly instructed his team, "Contact Mr. Ashford immediately. Osborne brought a woman with him - her status is too high for us to challenge. Only Mr. Ashford can handle this situation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne began his search for valuable uncut diamonds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn, watching Austin with admiration, couldn't help but comment, "Austin, the way you handled those guards was incredible - like a real power player! I wish I could be as commanding as you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin chuckled, quipping, "You? Forget it! You're not even the heir of the Radcliffe family, and you have a strict mother. It seems like you're destined to live in Clarissa's shadow for life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn's spirits plummeted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It stung to realize that as the young master of an old family, he wasn't living as comfortably as a true scion of a wealthy family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had no choice - the Radcliffe family had Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since her birth, all the other Radcliffe family descendants had stepped aside, leaving Clarissa to shine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the Radcliffe family was an old family, there were many offspring in the clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, Austin was the sole heir of the Montague family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Barlyn might have had a higher social standing, he was far outmatched by Austin's power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I might not be able to compete with Clarissa, but I'll build my own empire someday!" Barlyn declared defiantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin raised an eyebrow skeptically. "You? Build an empire? Don't make me laugh."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't believe in me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why should I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think you should believe in me. After all, we're best friends."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the two bickered, they followed Osborne, waiting for him to select the uncut diamonds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had already been through the market a few days ago, buying the most valuable pieces. Though many had been sold, there were still plenty of good finds left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he was focused on making money with Barlyn and Austin, so he took his time, carefully noting down every profitable uncut diamond he came across.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in a high-end restaurant, Wesley and Ophelia were having a meal and discussing the details of their upcoming wedding in two weeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley said with a hint of pride, "Ophelia, don't worry, the wedding preparations are nearly complete. I'll make sure you get the grandest wedding imaginable. The invitations have all been sent out, and soon, the high society of Mayby City will be there to bless us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia nodded absently. "Alright. You handle everything; I have no objections."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Ophelia's mind drifted back to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lately, she found herself constantly thinking about him. Every time she discussed wedding plans with Wesley, she couldn't help but feel a lack of enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed she wasn't entirely sure about marrying Wesley after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This uncertainty began after the incident at the diamond dealing market when Wesley had been so enraged by Osborne that he'd collapsed and vomited blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia had once believed that Osborne couldn't possibly compare to Wesley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But time and again, Wesley had been outmatched by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It appeared that Osborne wasn't as insignificant as she'd once thought, and Wesley wasn't as invincible as she'd believed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, Ophelia couldn't shake the feeling of regret over her divorce from Osborne and the idea of marrying Wesley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Wesley's phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He answered the call, and his face instantly turned pale with anger. "What? Osborne? That bastard! He's brought another woman to my diamond dealing market?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you idiots doing? You let a stranger intimidate you? In Mayby City, besides a few exceptions, who dare to disrespect the Ashford family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, I'm on my way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Make sure you stop Osborne from buying any uncut diamonds. Absolutely no way he gets his hands on any!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley hung up the phone after he finished cursing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up, Wesley gritted his teeth and turned to Ophelia. "Ophelia, I need to step out. Osborne's at my diamond dealing market again as if it's his personal stamping ground!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, I'm going to make sure he leaves on a stretcher!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Wesley paid the bill and stormed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia, stunned for a moment, quickly followed him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
