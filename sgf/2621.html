  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne never expected the fragrance of the Spirit-Entombing Roses to be so terrifying after blooming.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, this is the millennium's thinning period of the Spirit-Entombing Fragrance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When the Spirit-Entombing Fragrance is thin, it's already this terrifying. Under normal circumstances, wouldn't anyone entering Necropolis City die? They simply can't resist it unless they, like Osborne, possess an indestructible Soul Current Ocean and soul power far beyond their cultivation level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The terrifying Spirit-Entombing Fragrance continued to unleash its power, and more and more people fell. At this moment, no matter their strength or cultivation level, everyone struggled to resist the attack of the Spirit-Entombing Fragrance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one had the strength to save others, not even Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For this kind of Soul Attack, Osborne could only protect himself and couldn't help at all. Fortunately, Clara, Leroy, Adriana, and May were doing fine.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were surrounded by the blue Spirit-Entombing Fragrance, continuously enduring its Soul Attack. Although their faces were pale, they were still holding on.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only May was in the worst condition, with blood already trickling from the corner of her mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If this continues, perhaps everyone will collapse because of it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A total of about five hundred people entered Necropolis City, including three hundred royal guards, fifty royal members, fifty strong individuals from various forces who reached Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, and one hundred participants like Osborne who had not reached Empyrean Sacredness in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, at least one-third of these five hundred people had already collapsed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were beyond saving.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, people kept collapsing every moment, unable to withstand the Soul Attack of the Spirit-Entombing Fragrance. As the blue Spirit-Entombing Fragrance gathered and grew thicker, more and more people could not resist it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If this continues, no one will be able to withstand the fragrance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, what Osborne worried about did not happen. Soon, the blue Spirit-Entombing Fragrance around everyone stabilized, and no more appeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone gradually adapted to the attack of the Spirit-Entombing Fragrance and regained their composure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By this time, over two hundred people had fallen to the ground.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nearly half of the people died under the Soul Attack of the Spirit-Entombing Fragrance. Their soul power was directly obliterated, and the Soul Current Ocean shattered completely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the survivors looked extremely angry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne also seemed quite dissatisfied.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the hundred participants in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, over forty had already died, nearly half of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The ones who died the most were the royal guards. Among the three hundred royal guards, nearly half perished, all of whom had reached Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over a hundred people who reached Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection could almost wipe out most of the First-rate Powers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even someone like Adriana, who has reached Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, would need to flee when facing the siege of a hundred Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection experts, and she might not even escape successfully.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, now, they are all dead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In addition, six royal princes and princesses have already passed away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seven Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness experts from various major forces have died.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That's right. Seven of them have already perished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In such a situation, even Osborne couldn't help but take a deep breath. After entering Necropolis City, they hadn't done anything yet, but nine Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness experts had already died.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The number of dead has already exceeded two-fifths.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That's terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, even Frederick looked furious, as if he hadn't expected the Spirit-Entombing Fragrance's attack to be this powerful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Frederick was surrounded by an incredibly dense blue Spirit-Entombing Fragrance, making him seem like a giant blue figure. His cultivation level and strength were the highest, so he attracted the most Spirit-Entombing Fragrance attacks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he withstood it, so he didn't suffer any harm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Apart from Frederick, Adriana was surrounded by the most blue Spirit-Entombing Fragrance, followed by Weston.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Based on strength and cultivation level, others were surrounded by varying levels of Spirit-Entombing Fragrance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among all those who hadn't reached Empyrean Sacredness, Osborne was surrounded by the densest Spirit-Entombing Fragrance, followed by Clara and Leroy, and then Seraphina.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Based on the density of Spirit-Entombing Fragrance around them, their strength could roughly be assessed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph!" Adriana snorted coldly, "Emperor Frederick, you owe us an explanation! Why didn&rsquo;t you tell us earlier how terrifying the Spirit-Entombing Fragrance&rsquo;s attack is? That way, we could have at least prepared some Sacred Artifacts to resist Soul Attacks in advance!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as she finished speaking, everyone else angrily turned to Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had just barely escaped death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick calmly said, "Everyone, this was just a mistake. I didn&rsquo;t expect the Spirit-Entombing Fragrance&rsquo;s attack to still be this powerful. I apologize to all of you. But it wasn&rsquo;t intentional&mdash;over a hundred of my royal guards at the Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection level have died, and they were our main force!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even my seven sons and daughters have passed away..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I had known earlier, how could this have happened? I am deeply grieved now as well, but it&rsquo;s useless. They are already gone, and saying more won&rsquo;t change anything."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After he finished speaking, everyone fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing over a hundred royal guards and seven princes and princesses pass away, those who initially wanted to blame Frederick were left speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the royal family suffered greater losses this time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the over two hundred dead, more than one hundred and fifty were from the royal family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What else could they say?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That could only be called an accident.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph!" Adriana snorted coldly. She felt something was off in her heart but couldn't pinpoint the flaw, so she could only use Telepathy to tell Osborne to be more cautious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, stop wasting time!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now is when the Spirit-Entombing Fragrance is at its thinnest. Every three days, it becomes denser. It won't take long before it gets so strong that none of us can withstand it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, we don't have much time. Let's act now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Frederick looked at Seraphina and the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You should head to the Celestial Spire immediately. Once inside, take the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket. Don't worry. The Celestial Spire is very safe, and even if you can't pass its trials, your lives won't be in danger!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, entering the Celestial Spire is safer than staying outside!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Frederick finished speaking, a force swept over everyone present who had not reached Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, I will send you to the Celestial Spire!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Remember, you must pass the Celestial Spire's trials as quickly as possible and get the key to the Skyfall Casket. If you're too slow and waste too much time, the Spirit-Entombing Fragrance outside will become increasingly intense."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, the moment you leave the Celestial Spire will be the moment of your death."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You only have six days, at most nine. If you still can't pass the eighteenth trial and get the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket within nine days, you must withdraw immediately!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, I will send you out of Necropolis City..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Frederick finished speaking, he pointed toward the Celestial Spire with his finger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go ahead. We'll wait for you here! As for whether we can open the Eighth Skyfall Casket and obtain the countless treasures and opportunities inside, it all depends on you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Osborne and the others were enveloped by Frederick's power and swiftly flew toward the massive Celestial Spire at the top of Necropolis City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, everyone landed in front of the Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, standing so close to the Celestial Spire, they truly felt its immense size. They couldn't even see the tip of the spire when they looked up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The door of the Celestial Spire was towering, making them appear as tiny as ants.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, a heavy pressure weighed down on them.</span></p><div class="pagination">
