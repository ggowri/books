  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? You're leaving again? Absolutely not!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's words sent a shockwave through his uncles and aunts, who immediately erupted in protest. It seemed the earlier lectures hadn't quite hit home, and they were ready to give him another round of tough love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you still don't get it, do you?" one of his uncles exclaimed, shaking his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have any idea how dangerous it is out there? You've just taken down Caesar, one of the Paramount Supreme Clan's Five Brilliant Scions! They'll likely send a Supernal Deity King after you! Even here, you aren't completely safe, and you still want to go out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you lost your mind?" another chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way! We all disagree! You have to stay here within our sight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With the Hudson family protecting you, you're much safer!" they urged, their voices filled with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a warm surge of gratitude. These people genuinely cared about him and worried for his safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even knowing that his presence might bring trouble to the Hudson family, they still prioritized his well-being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But once Osborne made up his mind, there was no changing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they had exhausted their arguments, he finally spoke up, "Listen, everyone! I know you're all looking out for me, and I appreciate it more than you know. But I have to leave, and please, let me explain why.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First off, I don't want to drag the Hudson family into danger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I stay here and let you protect me against the Paramount Supreme Clan's attacks, even if you manage to hold them off, the family would still suffer heavy losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that happens, I'll never forgive myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary frowned, his voice serious. "Osborne, what are you saying? This is your home now; we are your family! Protecting our family, no matter the cost, is our duty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, understanding their perspective. "I get that! But there's a second reason I need to leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at each of them, his expression earnest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A bird that's always sheltered under its parents' wings never learns to fly! This encounter with Trevor has made me painfully aware of my weaknesses. I need to venture out and face challenges head-on to grow stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trevor won't let this go; the Baxter family won't, either, and neither will the Paramount Supreme Clan! If I can't become stronger quickly and rely solely on others for protection, I'm doomed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, the Human Community is in a critical situation right now. Our generation needs to step up. If we can't grow rapidly, how can we stand against the Dark Deity Legion? How can we confront Lord Malevolence? Are we just going to sit back and watch the Human Community get wiped out by the Dark Deity Legion?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, no matter what, I have to leave! You all know you can't stop me. I just hope you'll support me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished, a heavy silence fell over the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it's just too dangerous out there!" Alicia finally sighed, her voice laced with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "No place is always safe, Aunt Alicia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't forget, I'm the leader of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings! I was in the East Zone, and I took down Caesar, one of the Paramount Supreme Clan's Five Brilliant Scions, and still managed to walk away unscathed! This time, I just underestimated Trevor. I didn't expect him to have a Universe-Sealing Formation and a Binding Twin Pearl. Otherwise, even if Trevor were ten times stronger, he wouldn't have caught me! My spatial power isn't just for show!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that confident declaration, the room fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his spatial power, Osborne was indeed safe in most situations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if a Supernal Deity King were chasing him, as long as he wasn't cornered, he would be fine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, their concern lingered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After some intense discussion, Osborne finally managed to convince everyone to let him go without further protest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh, your stubbornness is just like your mother's!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back in the day, we all tried to talk her out of leaving with your father. But she didn't care; once she made up her mind, nobody could change it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just the same!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary sighed, looking at Osborne with a mix of nostalgia and longing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't help but wonder where your mother is now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I could turn back time, I wouldn't have stopped her from being with your father. At least then, they might have stayed home, and we wouldn't have to worry about them going missing or worse..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne bit his lip. "Uncle Zachary, don't worry!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My mother will be fine! I'll find her! Even if I have to turn Celestara upside down, I'll bring her back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he spoke, the mood in the room shifted, growing somber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary said, trying to lift the atmosphere, "Alright, enough about that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can leave, but you need to wait for your grandfather to come back. He has a Binding Twin Pearl as well. Once he binds it to you, you can leave. That way, if you run into trouble, he can rush to your side immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in surprise. "Grandpa has a Binding Twin Pearl, too?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
