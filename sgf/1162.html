  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne reflected on his recent journey, he couldn't help but think he'd had some pretty good luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going all in for the Blood Cross!" Osborne muttered through clenched teeth, forcing himself to continue down the corridor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crimson glow had intensified, now dazzling enough to make even his Satan's Eye feel a bit overwhelmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the Blood Cross, he would have turned back ages ago, but now he had no choice but to press on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each step, he felt the Blood Cross inside him simmering with energy. It calmed slightly as Osborne moved forward, but if he stopped, it would pulse in a frenzy, demanding he keep going.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Backing out would likely cause the Blood Cross to detach from him and flee, leaving him empty-handed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's find out what this is all about!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning a corner, Osborne was suddenly met with a blinding brilliance ahead. About 30 feet away, the crimson light flared up as if it were a blood-red sun, casting an eerie glow that made the surrounding light seem almost like flowing blood, thick and unnaturally viscous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is it? What is that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne squinted at the radiant mass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how he strained his sight, even with his Satan's Eye turned to its fullest extent, all he could really discern was that there was definitely something there, something that seemed to be drawing the Blood Cross's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He started to approach the glowing sphere, no longer able to hold back. "Whatever it is, I'm already here. If it really is Cain, the forefather of the Blood Clan, and he's here to reclaim the Blood Cross, well... I'll take him down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't care if you're the God of Sin or the God of Immortality; the Blood Cross is mine now, and no one's taking it away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne knew well enough that if it came to a fight he couldn't win, he'd be out of there in a heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stepped closer, inching toward the most brilliant part, and at about 16 feet away, he let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he still couldn't make out what it was, he was certain that it wasn't a person!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It bore a tapered shape, wider at the top and narrowing toward the base, subtly swaying in the light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the devil is that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of intrigue washed over him as he quickened his pace. As he closed the distance to 10 feet, the glowing object was finally clear to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne froze in disbelief, his eyes wide as he finally breached the brilliance of the crimson glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The swaying object revealed itself to be a plant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A solitary lotus that stood proudly, its elegant stem stretching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne gazed upon the blooming lotus, its name suddenly materialized in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was the true treasure of Blood Clan's progenitor, Cain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a Cosmic Treasure, the very source of Cain's immortality, emerging from the chaos prior to the birth of the universe itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't know why he knew this, but the revelation stopped him dead in his tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His breath quickened, his eyes alight with excitement and fervor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Is this really the Cosmic Treasure, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looks like the legendary Cain is truly dead. The Lotus fused with Cain's body, granting him his undead status, his reputed invincibility. Now, the Lotus is here, separated from Cain's possession. Without it, he's mortal and thus... dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's breathing grew heavier. The pieces started to fall into place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder the Blood Cross reacted so violently. It's the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity! The Cross itself was just an ordinary crucifix, but because it was worn by Cain, constantly bathed in the Lotus' power, it transformed into a mighty artifact imbued with formidable strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Cross is merely a derivative of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity! Or rather, the Lotus is the parent, and the Cross is the child. With the Lotus here, the Cross pales in comparison!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Cain's title as the father of the Blood Clan stemmed from his possession of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whoever held this relic became the true progenitor of the Blood Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes sparkled with ambition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that if he could fuse with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, he would not only become the true father of the Blood Clan but also gain the power of immortality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even shattered to cosmic dust or obliterated of soul, he could resurrect infinitely, powered by the Lotus' mighty essence, with no limits to his rebirth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as he had the power, he could revive as many times as necessary, leaving behind any fears of mortality!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's breathing quickened as he registered the absolute enormity of it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep within the earth, some 12 miles down, lay the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, a super Cosmic Treasure!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's mine for the taking!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
