  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lionel thought for a moment and felt Osborne's proposal was reasonable, then nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two kept a distance between them. He threw the Void Sword in one direction, while Osborne tossed the Kingdom Duel Badge in the other. With their respective speeds, they could only choose to pick up one item.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he chose the Kingdom Duel Badge, he would have to give up the Void Sword, allowing Osborne to easily obtain the Void Sword. Conversely, if he decided to go after the Void Sword, Osborne would have the chance to retrieve the Kingdom Duel Badge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this situation, each of them could obtain one item, completing the deal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're quite cautious!" Lionel sneered inwardly. "But you're still too young! You have no idea how many tricks a warrior who has cultivated for tens of thousands of years at the Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection level possesses! The Kingdom Duel Badge is mine. And you won't take the Void Sword either. Once you throw out the Kingdom Duel Badge, your death will follow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite plotting this in his heart, Lionel's face revealed no flaws.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Let's begin. Before those people catch up, let's finish the deal quickly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded in agreement. "Alright! I'll start the countdown. I will throw the Kingdom Duel Badge to your left. And you, please throw the Void Sword to your right. If I notice you throwing in the wrong direction or playing any tricks, I will immediately use spatial power to retrieve the Kingdom Duel Badge and rush into the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, no matter what you say, I won't believe you anymore!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lionel looked serious and said earnestly, "Don't worry, I just want the Kingdom Duel Badge. With it, I can buy several supreme Sacred Artifacts. I won't play any tricks!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne responded, "Alright!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Three!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Two!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"One!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment the countdown ended, Osborne threw the Kingdom Duel Badge toward Lionel's left side. At the same time, he saw Lionel toss the Void Sword in another direction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this step, Lionel didn</span><span>'</span><span>t play any tricks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly dashed toward the Void Sword, while Lionel, without hesitation, burst into his fastest speed, heading straight for the Kingdom Duel Badge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whoosh!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whoosh!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Both moved incredibly fast, but overall, Osborne was quicker since he possessed spatial power. With one interdimensional travel, he reached the Void Sword.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment Osborne grabbed the Void Sword, he immediately felt a violent and sharp force erupting from it. His palm was instantly covered with fine wounds, blood streaming down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's face was full of shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What immense power! With my current cultivation level and strength, I can't control this Void Sword at all. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, this </span><span>wa</span><span>s a supreme Sacred Artifact, and not the severely damaged type like the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, but a perfectly intact Supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if </span><span>he</span><span> br</span><span>oke</span><span> through to Empyrean Sacredness, </span><span>he </span><span>might not fully control it, let alone unleash its full power, and </span><span>he</span><span> could even suffer a backlash!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne decided to put away the Void Sword.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, he suddenly sensed a powerful force of resistance emanating from the Void Sword. This force was so intense that he couldn't store it in the Dimensional Space or Satan Space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression changed instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Lionel really tampered with the Void Sword. Although he erased his mark on the sword, he left behind other mysterious forces. This not only prevents me from controlling the Void Sword but also from storing it in the Dimensional Space. Truly a clever tactic!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the power erupting from the Void Sword had left Osborne's palm covered in wounds. Helpless, he could only temporarily throw the sword away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He turned his icy gaze toward Lionel on the other side.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Lionel had already reached the Kingdom Duel Badge, his face full of excitement and exhilaration. Without hesitation, he reached out and grabbed the Kingdom Duel Badge that originally belonged to Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He laughed and said, "Hahaha! Your Kingdom Duel Badge is mine now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And your over 46 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints are all mine too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lionel quickly stored the badge in the Dimensional Bag, as if fearing an accident might occur.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he completely failed to notice that the moment he grabbed the Kingdom Duel Badge, a dazzling ocular energy flashed through Osborne's eyes and quickly vanished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lionel slowly turned around, his gaze coldly fixed on Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Osborne's palm covered in blood and filled with fine cuts, with the Void Sword floating before him radiating immense power, making Osborne dare not touch it, he couldn't help but burst into laughter, his voice echoing in the empty space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He laughed and said, "You fell for it after all. You dared to try and make a deal with me? Do you even deserve it? You're too young, too naive! You can't even begin to imagine how powerful a Warrior who has trained for ten thousand years to reach Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection truly is, or how many methods they possess."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You think erasing the imprint on the Void Sword means you can easily obtain it? How utterly ridiculous. I have countless ways to ensure you don't even qualify to touch it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And now, your Kingdom Duel Badge is in my hands, while my Void Sword remains beyond your reach. Everything belongs to me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even your life is mine."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I will never let you go. With your talent, if given enough time, perhaps one day your strength and cultivation level might surpass mine. By then, if you seek revenge, it would be a disaster."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, will you choose to step onto the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign, or let me take your life myself?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as the words fell, Lionel's face twisted with a ferocious expression, stepping closer to Osborne step by step.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A terrifying killing intent and pressure engulfed Osborne like a towering mountain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne snorted coldly, pretending to be angry and shouted loudly, "Lionel, you</span><span>'</span><span>re so shameless! Using such despicable means to deceive me. Do you have any humanity left?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lionel sneered dismissively. "So what if I deceived you? Your mistake was possessing this wealth in the first place. With your strength and background, you can</span><span>'</span><span>t protect it. Even if I didn</span><span>'</span><span>t trick you, someone else would take it away."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Enough nonsense! Now, it</span><span>'</span><span>s your turn to die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before the words finished, Lionel was ready to strike.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, at that moment, his expression suddenly changed, and he swiftly turned around. He saw over a dozen incredibly powerful figures instantly appear in his sight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was the group that had been pursuing Osborne all along, finally arriving at the scene.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They lacked spatial power and the Void Sword, a Supreme Sacred Artifact capable of traversing time and space, so their speed was slower as they tracked Osborne's aura all the way here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Osborne, their eyes instantly lit up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, their gaze shifted to Lionel, filled with hostility.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hand over the Kingdom Duel Badge! Or die!" an elder shouted sharply at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne pointed at Lionel and shouted, "Kingdom Duel Badge? You're already too late. My Kingdom Duel Badge was taken by Lionel long ago. He traded it with me for the Void Sword but deceived me. Now, he has kept my Kingdom Duel Badge, and I can't take his Void Sword at all."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Osborne finished speaking, a dozen gazes instantly turned to Lionel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Lionel's expression was grim, he remained calm and said flatly, "He's right. You're indeed too late. His Kingdom Duel Badge now belongs to me. So, you can leave."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as these words were spoken, everyone</span><span>'</span><span>s eyes turned icy. "Lionel? That</span><span>'</span><span>s probably a fake name! No matter who you are, that kid</span><span>'</span><span>s Kingdom Duel Badge isn</span><span>'</span><span>t something you can keep for yourself!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hand it over! Or die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, a dozen people erupted with overwhelming killing intent, completely locking Lionel in place.</span></p><div class="pagination">
