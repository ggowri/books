  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, despair gripped every member of the Lambert family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone shouted frantically, bolting out of the crowd with desperate urgency, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run! We have nearly a thousand, and he's just one man. If we scatter, he can't possibly take us all out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following his lead, at least several dozen other Lambert family members saw the wisdom in his words and scattered in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the next instant, a flurry of chilling glints sliced through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heads of those who had fled flew, their blood spraying high into the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a matter of seconds, all those who had broken from the crowd were dead, the farthest reaching no more than two hundred yards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sight spurred even greater chaos and terror among the remaining Lambert family members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greyson's eyes reddened more as he witnessed another batch of his kin fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bellowed, trying to quell the panic, "Damn it! Everyone, stay calm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We must stay together! Only by sticking together can we stand a chance against a top-tier Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Disperse, and you're only making it easier for him to pick us off one by one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words did bring some calm to the crowd, yet fear still lingered in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Holding together could give them a fighting chance against a top-tier Class S?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only if they knew where he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin's Stealth Art was too formidable; they couldn't lock onto his position at all, rendering their joint attacks futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each time Sin revealed himself, he took down scores and vanished again, leaving them utterly powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this continued, they would all be doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greyson was acutely aware of this, but he was at a loss for any viable solutions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Lambert family, once numerous, now found themselves merely prey to Sin. He hid in the shadows like a patient hunter intent on thinning their numbers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What can we do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greyson's forehead beaded with sweat. He couldn&rsquo;t find a way to break Sin's stealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze then fell upon Osborne, for of all present, only he had the means to discern </span><span>Sin's stealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne was also busy fighting for his own survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daggers of divine artifact had punctured his shoulders and left leg, though non-lethal, severely hindering his capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Crimson had been injured by Osborne's kick, the disparity in their power remained vast. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her fury, she relentlessly assailed Osborne, her every strike with the divine artifact dagger breaking through his martial art aura and leaving fresh wounds!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, her own injuries, compounded by Osborne's counterstrike, had significantly diminished her power. Though she could breach his defenses, the force was sapped by ninety percent, leaving her strikes insufficient to hit him hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, Osborne struggled on, bloodied but unyielding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aware of Sin's massacre of the Lambert family, he could do nothing to help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short order, Osborne was drenched in his own blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just the span of a minute, Crimson's wrath had carved hundreds of shallow cuts on him, which caused a big blood loss and forced him into woozy desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne winced as the desperate screams of the Lambert family echoed in his ears once more. Sin had found another opportunity, striking down dozens more with brutal efficiency before disappearing again into the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terror amongst the Lambert family escalated; those who were injured but hadn't yet died were crying out in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "This can't keep happening! The backup from Blood Demon won't arrive for at least five more minutes! At Sin's level of power, in five minutes, he might not wipe out every last one of them, but he could just as easily take out seventy or eighty percent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's absolutely unacceptable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've got to help them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustration bubbled within him as he found himself ensnared by Crimson. She was holding him back, making escape impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to take this old hag down first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, Osborne sensed that Crimson was wounded&mdash;if she weren't, there was no way a top-tier Class S warrior, placed in the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings in the top fifty, would be as weak as she was now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pondered, a spark of hope igniting in his chest, "Right now, her power is on par with Everett's!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe there's a slim chance I could take her down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I can just eliminate her, I'll be free to join forces with the Lambert family and face Sin together!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With newfound resolve, Osborne quickly formulated a plan. As Crimson unleashed another frenzy of attacks, Osborne didn&rsquo;t dodge but let the dagger pierce into his body, a calculated risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with every ounce of strength, he seized Crimson's arm.</span></p><div class="pagination">
