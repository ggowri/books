These rare metal mines along our coast all produce this kind of pyrite, but this pyrite is too rare, so there's no need to sell it, and it has always been thrown away. I didn't expect it to be no ordinary pyrite!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Originium?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather murmured, carefully sensing the power in the Originium, and his expression suddenly&nbsp;changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather, what's wrong? Did you find anything?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather shook his head and did not answer immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated for a moment and said, "Be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he suddenly threw the Originium out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, an invisible wave burst out from&nbsp;Godfather's body, and the Originium that was thrown far away seemed to be activated by this wave and changed instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom </span><span>boom</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heaven and earth seemed to shake,&nbsp;The Originium suddenly flickered and exploded, and a terrible force swept across hundreds of&nbsp;yards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrible shock wave came towards&nbsp;Osborne and&nbsp;Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces changed.&nbsp;They were about to defend themselves, but&nbsp;Godfather had already blocked their way and&nbsp;pushed them out heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The violent shock wave made&nbsp;Godfather take a step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face&nbsp;was full of disbelief&nbsp;at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, all the power dissipated.&nbsp;Godfather coughed and said, "I am really old! It is difficult to resist such power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, his expression became extremely solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This Originium is extremely terrifying! It contains enormous power. Although this power is not much, it is of a very high level. It seems to be..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The legendary divine power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After&nbsp;Godfather finished speaking,&nbsp;Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The legendary divine power? The energy in Originium is divine power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was also stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression suddenly changed, and she said, "I know what it is now. It is not called Originium but should be called&nbsp;Divine Bone Crystal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine Bone Crystal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and&nbsp;Godfather both looked at&nbsp;Clarissa in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa said, "Osborne, you know that every time I break through a realm, some inexplicable information will appear in my mind. The information is very complicated, and I won't touch it easily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Godfather... Godfather said that the power in it is likely the legendary divine power, so I searched my memory and found the thing that best matches it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's the&nbsp;Divine Bone Crystal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The&nbsp;Divine Bone Crystal is not the bone fossil left behind by the gods after their death, but a special substance that can be used to forge divine bodies! According to legend, as long as there are enough&nbsp;Divine Bone Crystals, one can forge true&nbsp;Divine Bones. If one replaces his bones with&nbsp;Divine Bones,&nbsp;he&nbsp;can&nbsp;own&nbsp;a divine body!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The divine body is extremely powerful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Having a divine body means&nbsp;that person becomes&nbsp;half a god. If&nbsp;he&nbsp;also possesses divine power..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He will be the real god!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After&nbsp;Clarissa finished speaking,&nbsp;Osborne and&nbsp;Godfather's&nbsp;expressions&nbsp;changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said solemnly, "So, the reason the&nbsp;King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> started the war was to get enough&nbsp;Divine Bone Crystals? He wanted to use&nbsp;Divine Bone Crystals to forge </span><span>his own&nbsp;Divine Bones and build a divine body?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He wants to become a god?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne&nbsp;gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa shook her head, "I don't think so!&nbsp;Even if&nbsp;he owns enough Divine Bone Crystals, it is very difficult to forge&nbsp;Divine Bones! Only a true god can use his divine power to refine the Divine Bone Crystals."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather heaved a sigh of relief when he heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his expression was still extremely&nbsp;serious, and he asked, "Clarissa, is the only function of the&nbsp;Divine Bone Crystal Stone to forge&nbsp;Divine Bones?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course not!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa shook her head, "The Divine Bone Crystal can also replenish the divine power, and can even become a substance that can revive the gods!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne opened his mouth wide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Reviving&nbsp;the gods?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather's expression suddenly changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa shook her head again, "Don't worry, the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> can't do it! To revive the gods is more difficult than forging&nbsp;Divine Bones! And it also requires many things more precious than the&nbsp;Divine Bone Crystal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having said that, Clarissa's expression suddenly changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think I know what the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> wants to do with these&nbsp;Divine Bone Crystals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she finished speaking,&nbsp;Osborne and&nbsp;Godfather both looked at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, tell me quickly, what exactly does the&nbsp;King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> want to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa said solemnly, "Osborne, Godfather, don't you wonder where those clones of&nbsp;the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> came from? If I'm not mistaken, the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> has the corpses of several ancient gods in his hands!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He extracted the genes of these ancient gods from their corpses and cloned them using special means, allowing them to possess some of the power of the ancient gods!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With the Divine Bone Crystal, the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>&nbsp;can&nbsp;create numerous clones. These people who possess the power of ancient gods will be more powerful than the current clones!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
