  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An ancient magic weapon at level two?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but wonder what the Augustine family's ancient magic weapon at level two looked like.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Isaac clapped his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, four people entered from outside. Their faces were flushed, and their footsteps were unusually heavy, as though burdened by something of great weight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, they carried the item to the center of the meeting room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a dull bang, the entire meeting room seemed to shake, and everyone glanced at the weighty object with surprise on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's actually the Guardian Shield!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isaac, you actually want Osborne to use the Guardian Shield! Can he handle it? Even after Kaden's transformation, he struggles to wield the Guardian Shield effortlessly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne listened to their discussion and followed their gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an ancient shield, modest in size, round in shape, reminiscent of a knight's shield popular centuries ago, measuring just about 12 inches in diameter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a one-handed shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, even such a small one-handed shield required four cultivated martial artists to lift together, and it was still incredibly strenuous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was very curious about its material.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, behold the Guardian Shield! Crafted by the first-generation ancestor of the Augustine family, it has seen battlefields where he killed countless enemies and safeguarded our family, and it was stained with blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Later, it was placed in the ancestral land of our family by the first-generation ancestor. While being worshipped and prayed for by the descendants, it gradually absorbed the aura of the Augustine family members and became an ancient magic weapon with extreme defensive power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After hundreds of years of worship, it has ascended to an ancient magic weapon at level two, nearing level three! It stands as the oldest and most potent ancient magic weapon within the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I'll give it to you temporarily!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you remain in the Augustine family, it belongs exclusively to you. Its name is the Guardian Shield!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope you will safeguard our family and our centuries-old heritage with it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac was extremely serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was moved, his expression growing solemn. He could sense Isaac's trust and high expectations of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Isaac. I won't disappoint you! As part of the Augustine family, I will carry this shield to safeguard our family members and our heritage."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne approached the Guardian Shield with a straight face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath and grasped its grip, which was very smooth, indicating that someone had often held it in battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt at once the steady power within which provided people with peace of mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne exerted a little force with his palm and easily picked up the Guardian Shield, fitting it tightly against his arm. He waved his hand and found it extremely handy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Isaac came to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He patted Osborne with his hand, and suddenly, a strange breath surged into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne experienced a closer connection with the Guardian Shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed to have truly recognized him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he made a move, a strong yellow light abruptly burst out from the Guardian Shield and condensed into the shadow of a giant grizzly bear blocking in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All members of the Augustine family instantly exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The grizzly bear was their family's emblem!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all stared at the shadow of a grizzly bear with enthusiasm and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perfect!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac was thrilled. "Osborne, you are indeed the most suitable person to use the Guardian Shield! The Maritime Auction is tied to the survival of the Augustine family. I hope you can lead everyone to overcome the difficulties together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded vigorously, overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After glancing at the members of the Augustine family around him, he suddenly noticed a different gaze, which was cold and angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but furrow his eyebrows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't think much about it and withdrew the power of the Guardian Shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, let's stick to the plan and proceed accordingly! From now on, the Augustine family will maintain peak combat readiness for seven days until the Maritime Auction is over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, prepare for battle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac waved his hand, and everyone left immediately, including Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While there was still some time, he had to make some other preparations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, at the Paltrow Estate, Wade and Alexander sat facing each other, their expressions icy cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wade, has the ancient magic weapon been delivered to the Augustine Estate?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade nodded and snorted, "Yes! They will definitely be very pleased to get an ancient magic weapon at level three, but they will soon be extremely disappointed as it is simply unusable! Our family has been researching it for nearly a century, yet we still haven't found a way to make it functional, so they can only keep it as an antique."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander sneered, "That's great! I hope the ancient magic weapon can fulfill its purpose! As long as it can explode and kill Isaac or Osborne, it will have served its role."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rest assured. It must be successful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have studied it for a hundred years. Though unable to use it, we can still tamper with it. Just a thought from me can trigger its collapse, releasing its immense energy in a fatal explosion. Even a Class A Power Master will surely perish."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade looked very complacent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But this isn't the moment for that discussion. Just now, I received a confidential message from the Aberrants. They've requested our masters to collaborate with them in launching an assault on the Draco Group's Maritime Auction..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
