  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa, Titan, and Werewolf were all staring at him. Seeing him frozen in a charging stance, they instantly felt irritated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! I didn't expect that Tauren would win in the end. We got outdone by him! But what's with this pose? It's annoying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Titan voiced his frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa was also displeased. The fact that Osborne, whom they couldn't defeat, got badly injured and defeated by Tauren left her feeling uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tauren, hurry up and finish him! Don't waste time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won. No need to strike a pose," Medusa called out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tauren seemed not to hear them at all. He remained silent, still standing there. He was frozen in his charging stance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, they all sensed something was off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did Tauren knock himself out?" Werewolf murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, something's wrong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vampire, who hadn't made a move yet, suddenly shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tauren's aura is fading fast! No, he's already dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vampire's words left everyone in disbelief. After carefully sensing Tauren's aura, their faces showed shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tauren was dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked coldly at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tauren was indeed powerful. His thick hide was the toughest defense Osborne had ever encountered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And his brute force charge, though simple and direct, was too fast to dodge easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once hit, even Osborne couldn't defend against it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tauren was the most dangerous of the five opponents to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In theory, he was also the hardest to deal with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Osborne had a technique specifically for opponents like Tauren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that was...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deadly Force!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deadly Force that Isa taught Osborne allowed him to channel all his force directly through Tauren's tough hide, striking his insides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, even though Tauren had charged Osborne, sending him flying and even breaking his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had already landed a punch on Tauren's head. The immense force went through his hide and turned his brain to mush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tauren died in that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of his four legs, he remained standing until the last of his strength left him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tauren's massive body collapsed with a thud, lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's dead?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all stunned. None of them expected Tauren, the one with the strongest defense, to be dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They replayed Osborne's punch in their minds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That punch didn't even look that terrifying. They felt confident they could have blocked it, at most getting a minor injury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did Tauren die instead?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't figure it out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But their expressions toward Osborne had shifted. There was no more casual disdain, only serious, cautious looks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had just killed one of their own!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant Osborne was no longer the insignificant pest they thought he was. He was now a deadly snake, capable of killing them. No longer a plaything!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like we can't keep toying with him anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's all attack together! We'll kill him and avenge Tauren!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tauren's unexpected death had shaken the remaining four. They could no longer stay calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They now felt the threat he posed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a single command, they all attacked simultaneously, unleashing their powers against Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All four of them were Class AAA. If it were one-on-one, Osborne wouldn't fear any of them. Even if he couldn't win, he wouldn't lose either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with all four attacking at once, Osborne instantly felt overwhelming pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa's eyes gleamed, and she unleashed the Deadly Petrification with a sharp cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, half of Osborne's body turned to stone. Although his martial art aura kept the petrification from spreading further, it severely hindered his movements, making it hard for him to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Titan swung his massive fist, aiming straight for Osborne's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Werewolf wasn't far behind. He lunged forward. His claws rapidly slashed, piercing Osborne's martial art aura and wounding his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the most sinister attack came from Vampire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hadn't fought Vampire before, so he wasn't familiar with his techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a distance, Vampire waved his hand toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly felt his blood boiling violently. His veins surged with chaotic energy, causing intense discomfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if his blood wanted to burst out of his body and rush toward Vampire.</span></p><div class="pagination">
