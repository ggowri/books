  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the relentless barrage from Icy One and his crew, Osborne's body detonated in a spectacular explosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha!" Icy One couldn't contain his glee, his face lighting up with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a talent rivaling even the God of Night, perhaps even surpassing him, and yet he had fallen at Icy One's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The hope of the Human Community is utterly extinguished!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Two and Icy Three let out sighs of relief, their tension finally easing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He had some serious defenses! His Divine Body was incredibly robust, managing to withstand our combined assault for so long. No wonder Icy Six bit the dust against him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One scoffed, saying, "But what does it matter now? He's dead! The Human Community will never see Osborne again! Three of the Seven Young Deity Kings are gone, and they're hardly a threat anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned his gaze toward the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she had finally broken through the blockade set by Icy Four and Icy Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes widened in horror as she watched Osborne's body explode, leaving her momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, anger and a deadly intent crept across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Is he really dead? Or is this some kind of trick?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a fleeting instant, even the God of Light was at a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It appeared that Osborne was completely obliterated. No amount of white Miracle Elixir or intervention from the Goddess of Life could bring him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then she remembered his plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this all just an act? But if he's in pieces like this, how could he possibly survive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light bit her lip, anxiety creeping in as she feared that Osborne's "fake death" had failed, and Icy One had genuinely killed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fury surged within her, and she shouted, "You killed him?! You've snuffed out the hope of the Human Community! You all deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a wave of murderous intent enveloped Icy One and his allies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her rage was a mix of genuine emotion and performance, a calculated act to convince them that Osborne's demise was real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She recalled Osborne's instructions&mdash;no matter whether he was truly dead or merely playing dead, she had to unleash her fury to ensure Icy One and the others believed he was gone for good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A blinding light erupted from her, causing the very fabric of the void to tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One and his companions exchanged worried glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This isn't good! The God of Light is going all out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One stepped in front of his comrades. "Osborne is dead; our mission is accomplished! You all retreat&mdash;I'll hold the God of Light off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then sneered, saying, "God of Light, what does your anger matter now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne is dead, and I'm the one who ended him! You finally had a prodigy with the talent to rival the God of Night, and if given time, he could have become another threat to our Paramount Supreme Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But he's gone now! He was foolish to try and sneak up on us. He got what he deserved! Even if you rage, it won't bring him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why not just let it go? You can't kill us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Icy One stood tall, looking down at the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were ablaze with fury as she growled, "Let it go? You must be dreaming!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You killed Osborne, and you're all going to pay! I'll wipe you out for his sake! Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light unleashed a furious assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, despite her best efforts, she couldn't pin down Icy One. Though she managed to injure him, he and the rest of the Dark Sovereigns quickly made their escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Sanctum of Light returned to its former luminosity, silence fell over the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light stood frozen, staring at the spot where Osborne had been obliterated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Jethro, Julian, and the others rushed onto the scene, their expressions filled with concern and confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The esteemed God of Light, Osborne... he..." Jethro's voice trembled as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was all an act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, he knew Osborne had the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, which meant death was not necessarily final.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Jethro couldn't be sure if any remaining warriors in the Human Community had already betrayed them, possibly acting as spies for the Paramount Supreme Clan. He had to carry on with his performance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes glistened with unshed tears, and his body shook with emotion as he continued, "Osborne... did he really die?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My grandson! With such talent, he was destined to become a champion for the Human Community, a beacon of hope! How could this happen?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why was it not me? Why?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro's face twisted in agony, and the other members of the Hudson family watched, equally grief-stricken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light snapped back to reality, gazing at the devastated Jethro, her lips parting as if to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she didn't know about Osborne's plan, she might have believed Jethro's tragic act to be genuine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even now, she remained uncertain about Osborne's fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her jaw clenched, and she said, "Mr. Jethro Hudson, my deepest condolences! We're all heartbroken over Osborne's loss. But death is final..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, her expression suddenly shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Death is final? Is it really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A memory flickered in her mind&mdash;the God of Night had once hinted at something extraordinary about the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it really possess the power of resurrection?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realization dawned on the God of Light, filling her with a surge of hope that she dared not express.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She maintained her facade, continuing to play the part alongside Jethro.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of shared sorrow, she waved her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Jethro Hudson, you stay here. The rest of you should return!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Though Osborne is gone, our war with the Paramount Supreme Clan must press on! We will avenge Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a heavy sigh, Julian and the others offered their condolences to Jethro before departing, leaving only Jethro, Anastasia, Zoe, and a few others behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With another wave of her hand, the God of Light unleashed a powerful aura, enveloping them and shielding them from prying eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the sorrowful mask slipped away from Jethro and the others, replaced by a calm demeanor that signaled their true emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this transformation, the God of Light felt a wave of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne is alive, isn't he?" she asked urgently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro nodded, cupping his hands as he assured her. "Don't worry, Osborne is safe! But he said this must remain our secret&mdash;no one outside should know! There may still be traitors among us in the Human Community..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light nodded in understanding, relief flooding through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as he lives, that's what matters! He scared me half to death! Where is he? Bring him out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But suddenly, her expression shifted again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light turned her head, shock washing over her face as she turned to see Osborne's form rapidly regenerating not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a heartbeat, three figures appeared before them&mdash;Osborne, Diana, and Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a grin, Osborne addressed the God of Light, "Thank you for your cooperation, it all went smoothly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light stood there, dumbfounded. "You actually came back to life?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her shock was palpable as she stared at Osborne, weighing the gravity of his return. "Is it because of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity? Does it truly have the power to bring someone back from the dead?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
