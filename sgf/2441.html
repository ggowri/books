  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the two Dimensional Bags, Leroy and Clara casually took them without much concern.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara asked, "Osborne, what's really going on inside?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Have you already taken care of everything? Since you've given us the spoils, it seems the matter inside is settled. But this time, we didn't do anything."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she spoke, Clara opened the Dimensional Bag.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She planned to put all the spoils into one Dimensional Bag. That way, after the zone duel ended, she could directly use it to exchange for Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when she opened the Dimensional Bag, she froze, staring in disbelief at the contents inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She suddenly stopped talking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy noticed her unusual behavior and asked curiously, "Clara, what's wrong?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara didn't respond to him, still staring at the contents of the Dimensional Bag, feeling utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy quickly opened the Dimensional Bag as well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he froze too, staring in shock at the pile of Ice Beetle corpses in the Dimensional Bag, like a small mountain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How many corpses are there?" Clara finally came to her senses and asked, her voice trembling slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "Each of you gets three million Ice Beetle corpses."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although she had expected it, Clara was still shocked when she heard the number.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three million Ice Beetle corpses!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each Ice Beetle can be exchanged for 2,000 Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, and three million Ice Beetle corpses equal six billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Six billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had worked hard for several days, but their loot could only be exchanged for over 800 million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Osborne had just entered that cave for a while, and upon coming out, he distributed loot worth six billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints to each of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is just too much!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, after doing some quick calculations, Clara discovered that Osborne had obtained a total of 15 million Ice Beetle corpses after entering the cave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Did Osborne wipe out the Ice Beetles?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How could there be so many?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Like Clara, Leroy was also utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "No. These Ice Beetles seem a bit different from the ones we got before. There are no signs of attack on them, and they don't appear to have just died."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't possibly tell Clara and Leroy anything about the true situation of the Dimensional Microcosm. It wasn't because he didn't trust them, but because the existence of the Drum of Empress Kira was far too important to be revealed to anyone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he simply said, "You're right. These Ice Beetles indeed didn't just die, and I didn't kill them. That place seems to be a graveyard for Ice Beetles. Those about to die naturally eventually come here and then pass away."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ice Beetles' graveyard?" Leroy and Clara were stunned and said in unison.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They never expected such a place, nor did they expect Osborne to collect fifteen million naturally deceased Ice Beetle corpses without doing anything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, looking at Osborne, Leroy and Clara both felt that his luck seemed a bit too good.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Clara gritted her teeth and said, "Osborne, I can't take these spoils. This is just too much. These are worth a total of six billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints! If converted into Sacred Crystals, even most Second-rate Powers probably couldn't come up with so many Sacred Crystals."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We didn't do anything, so we can't take these spoils."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Clara handed the Dimensional Bag back to Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy also gritted his teeth and returned the Dimensional Bag to Osborne. "Clara is right. We can't take these spoils. It's just too much. These are what you found, so they belong to you. Take them back."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately felt a bit speechless. "We already agreed on the distribution plan for the spoils earlier."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's different," Clara said. "Our distribution plan only applies to the spoils from enemies we defeated together. Even though we couldn't help you in the fight, at least we could help you handle the spoils at that time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But these Ice Beetles weren't killed by us; you found them. What you picked up yourself doesn't need to be shared with us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We already owe you too much and can't be greedier. In short, we absolutely won't take these Ice Beetle corpses. Otherwise, we can only..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, her cheeks turned red, and Clara shyly said, "If you insist on sharing these spoils with us, we can only become your women. That way, we can repay your kindness. Only by becoming your woman can I feel more at ease accepting your goodwill."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Clara's words, Leroy's face also turned red.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she also nodded and said, "Clara's meaning is my meaning. If you insist on sharing these spoils with us, then you must accept us as your women. Are you willing to accept us?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?" Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Leroy and Clara's similar confessions and seeing their flushed cheeks, Osborne suddenly felt a bit flustered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He coughed and quickly said, "Since you are so determined, I won't force you. Let's leave here quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne walked forward somewhat flustered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Clara and Leroy quickly exchanged a glance, their eyes filled with disappointment and regret.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's so clueless!" they whispered softly, then quickly caught up with him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After that, the atmosphere between the three became a bit awkward. Clara and Leroy's bold words had broken a certain tacit understanding among them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could swear that helping Leroy and Clara was simply because he thought they could be friends, and he truly had no intention of making them his women.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne could only remain silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could feel that Leroy and Clara had developed feelings for him, but he didn&rsquo;t dare to respond and could only play dumb.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luckily, they were soon distracted by something else.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The intensity of the battle ahead is strong," Clara said gravely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "The Magma Devourer must have clashed with Mr. Norton and the other judges again. It actually made its way through the center of the glacier area. If it goes any further, it'll return to the volcanic region."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">In the glacier area, the Magma Devourer's strength will be suppressed. After entering the center of the glacier area, the impact on it will be even greater. But even so, Mr. Norton and the other judges still couldn't kill the Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go take a look," Osborne urged Flash to speed up. Soon, he spotted the Magma Devourer through Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne became excited because the Magma Devourer was actually fleeing for its life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its injuries were severe. Its blood looked like flowing magma, oozing from every part of its body. It had grown much weaker. Even its two massive forelimbs were injured, almost severed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Behind it, over forty judges were relentlessly chasing it, with Gerald leading the charge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Gerald's condition wasn't good either. Clearly, he was seriously injured as well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald roared, "Quick! Let's kill it now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It killed so many of our comrades. We absolutely can't let it escape. It's about to leave the glacier area. We must stop it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Otherwise, once it returns to the volcanic area, its strength will grow rapidly. If that happens, we won't be able to kill it. Let's finish it now!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
