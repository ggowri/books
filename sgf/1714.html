  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the four, Zoe's approach was the most enigmatic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing still, she faced the oncoming Bowman family guards and simply began to </span><span>sing. Her voice flowed like a melodic river, enchanting everyone around her, making them feel utterly blissful as if every pore in their bodies opened up to the sweet sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for the four guards rushing toward her, time seemed to freeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their expressions turned blank, and their divine power began to fluctuate wildly, spiraling out of control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, all four collapsed, their divine power spiraling into chaos as blood poured from their noses and mouths, their eyes glazed over as they had turned into mindless fools.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle was over!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe had been the last to act, yet she had brought the fight to a swift conclusion. Almost simultaneously, Kendra and Mila finished off their opponents as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ironically, it was Bryce, the loudest of the group, who took the longest to deal with his adversaries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he finally knocked down his last foe, he erupted into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! Pathetic!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this what the geniuses of various clans under the Lord Malevolence are like? They're nothing but pushovers in front of me. Is this really peak Deity Overlord strength? So weak, so weak!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After his boastful declaration, Bryce suddenly noticed that everyone else had already wrapped up their fights, leaving him momentarily speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You guys really don't know how to savor the moment! Why rush to finish them off? I took my time, enjoying the thrill of battle! If I had wanted, I could have taken them down much quicker!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others laughed at his antics.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra covered her face in disbelief. "Bryce, can you stop embarrassing yourself? We've sparred for years; how many times have you lost? And you even used a divine artifact while we didn't!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce's lips twitched at her remark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't you give me a little credit? You're all just freaks of nature! Besides, my water elemental power isn't exactly known for its offensive capabilities. I only took a few seconds longer to finish the fight. That's still pretty impressive, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hint of melancholy crossed his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he considered himself talented, the others around him were even more extraordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever! You're still the weakest!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra shot back, mercilessly chipping away at his confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce felt even more frustrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having been trapped in the Dimensional Microcosm for twenty years, they had often sparred, and he had lost every single time to Anastasia, Zoe, Kendra, and Mila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He desperately wanted to face the geniuses of the various clans, hoping to bully someone else and regain his confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zoe, you're the best!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not really; you and Mila are the real powerhouses here; I just happen to have a unique elemental affinity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mila is definitely strong, but you're impressive, too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I think Kendra is the one who's truly amazing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three girls ignored Bryce's wounded pride and continued to praise each other, leaving him feeling even more dejected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at Osborne and Anastasia, then quickly looked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He muttered, "Forget it. Those two are on another level. I can't compete!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a resigned sigh, Bryce began to clean up the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Hannah, who had been held back by Osborne, was completely dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Bryce, Kendra, and the others charged at the sixteen Bowman family guards, she had been filled with worry and wanted to jump in to help, but Osborne had stopped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the time, she didn't understand, prepared to intervene at a moment's notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, what unfolded next left her utterly speechless. Bryce, Kendra, Mila, and Zoe had each faced 16 peak Deity Overlord guards and defeated them in the blink of an eye!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was nothing short of a one-sided massacre!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah had never witnessed a battle like this before; it all seemed so effortless. The strength displayed by Bryce and the others left her in a state of shock, her entire body feeling cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're not Deity Kings?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're peak Deity Overlords?" she murmured to herself, struggling to process the implications.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Exactly. Technically, they should be considered Quasi-Deity Kings now. Their elemental essences have reached Level Seven."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah gasped, and her eyes wide with disbelief. "Wow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just last week, she had prided herself on being one of the most talented among various clans. Even against elite talents from the Paramount Supreme Clan, she hadn't felt intimidated; she had always believed she could hold her own and win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah had hidden her identity and challenged the greatest talents of various clans without ever tasting defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Bryce, Kendra, Mila, and Zoe dismantle their opponents so effortlessly, Hannah was hit with a realization that knocked the wind out of her sails</span><span>, </span><span>their talents were just as great, if not greater, than hers!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah felt a wave of discouragement wash over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing her turmoil, Osborne quickly stepped in with reassurance. "Hannah, don't sell yourself short!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're remarkable in your own right! You're only in the mid-stage of Deity Overlord, yet your strength rivals that of an ordinary peak Deity Overlord. Once you reach the pinnacle and become a Quasi-Deity King, you'll be right up there with them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She managed a slight smile at his words, though a cloud of worry soon returned to her expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what if I don't live to see that day?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
