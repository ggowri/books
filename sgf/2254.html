  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in his quarters, Osborne immediately settled into a state of seclusion to concentrate on his training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sect Tournament had concluded, but he wasn't basking in the glory of his victory; after all, it was merely the Sect Tournament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, throughout the vast expanse of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, countless Second-rate and First-rate Powers were holding their own Sect Tournaments, and each sect would ultimately crown a champion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such champions, aside from their own sects, would hardly be noticed anywhere else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's sights were set much higher&mdash;he aimed to compete in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being the champion of Mystic Sirius Sect was just the beginning; he still needed to win the city duel in Tempest Fortress City, snag the championship in the Zephyr State duel, and finally secure a top-ten finish in the Eastern Zone 3 zone duel to qualify for the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A long and arduous journey had just kicked off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was dead-set on not letting his newly-won title go to his head. The Glorious Divine Kingdom was vast, teeming with countless tough opponents. He didn't for a second think he was now unbeatable below the Empyrean Sacredness level. Only time would reveal how many prodigies he'd come up against and how much pressure they'd bring to bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Failure was out of the question. Osborne had to take part in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, make it to the capital, visit the Royal Sepulcher, and pay his respects to his poor mother from his past life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That meant he had to get even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How can I merge more powers and boost my Sacred Power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne </span><span>pondered,</span><span> his brow furrowed in deep thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By fully merging with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, he'd acquired several of its amazing abilities. One of them </span><span>allowed him to</span><span> create a Fusion Vessel, which </span><span>enabled</span><span> him to forcefully combine different elemental powers and obtain Sacred Power ahead of schedule.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd smartly used this strategy to fuse spatial and dark energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he was eager to merge even more forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>How on earth can I rapidly strengthen the Fusion Vessel? How do I grow more foundational carriers? I feel like I've hit a brick wall. The third carrier base for the Fusion Vessel is within reach, but it just won't budge!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's frown grew deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Gaining Sacred Power at the Supernal Deity King level isn't just for my own sake! In the upcoming city duel, state duel, and even the zone duel, I'm bound to run into opponents who also have Sacred Power!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Once that happens, my advantage will evaporate. They'll have Sacred Power too, and their cultivation levels might well be higher than mine. Beating them will be an uphill battle.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I've got to merge new forces and beef up my Sacred Power to stay ahead of the game!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne tried all sorts of ways to break through this bottleneck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sadly, every attempt ended in failure. The elusive Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, his Fusion Vessel, was still stuck with just two petals, which meant he only had two foundational carriers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The third petal stubbornly refused to bloom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustrated, Osborne took a break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, he felt a knock on his door. That made him stop meditating and go open up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, Osborne! Ms. Olsen sent me to give this to you. It's the info on the opponents you'll face in the upcoming city duel!" Maddox said as he handed over a stack of papers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took the materials gratefully, shut the door, and then dug into the details. As he read through the info, his expression went from focused to shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela had only gathered data on five opponents&mdash;three from Azure Haven Academy and two from Fantasia Isle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, "Leroy Holiday, this year's champ from Azure Haven Academy! A real dark horse, at the Quasi Empyrean Sacredness level and already wielding Sacred Power. She took down Marreese, last tournament's Azure Haven Academy winner who also won the last city duel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marreese Livingston, this year's runner-up from Azure Haven Academy. He was the previous city </span><span>duel</span><span> champion too. He's at the Quasi Empyrean Sacredness level, and his attacks are brutal. Very few can withstand three of his blows...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then there's Pero Korver. He came in third in this year's Azure Haven Academy tournament and also placed third in the last city duel. He took down Vadim in just three moves during that duel, and now he's even more powerful and quicker!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next is Tyson Barea, the champion of this year's Fantasia Isle tournament and the runner-up in the last city duel. His power is almost as good as Marreese's. They went head-to-head for a whole hour, and Tyson managed to block ninety-nine of Marreese's attacks before finally getting beaten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And let's not overlook Clara Rondo, the runner-up from Fantasia Isle! She's a real wild card. She didn't actually lose to Tyson but decided to forfeit their match. Her strength is probably on par with Tyson's, and her defenses are rock-solid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne skimmed through the information in a hurry, his surprise mounting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These five are all really tough opponents!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three of them were in the top three of the last city </span><span>duel</span><span>. Even the weakest of them could beat Vadim in just three moves, and now they're even more badass! The other two are total dark horses...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>One of them even took down the former city </span><span>duel</span><span> champion! And like me, they've already got Sacred Power, which makes them a real handful!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>No wonder Ms. Olsen thinks it'll be an uphill battle for me to win the city </span><span>duel</span><span> title. She even doubts I can make it into the top three! She reckons if I can land in the top five, that'd be a pretty solid feat...</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But the top five </span><span style="font-style: italic;">isn't</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> my goal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">My only aim is to take home the championship!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was just the city duel. If </span><span>I</span><span> </span><span>couldn't score a win here, it'd be next to impossible to cut through the competition and eventually qualify for the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After noting down the details of these five opponents, Osborne got back to his training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time flew by, and before he knew it, over ten days had passed. Even though it felt like he'd been in seclusion for three years due to the accelerated time, his progress was barely noticeable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cultivation level was still stuck at Ascension Eight, and he was miles away from reaching Ascension Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for his dark, space, and lightning elemental essences, they were still in the late stages of Level Ten, not too far from hitting their peak. Osborne figured that once the city duel was over, he could take some time to push himself harder and probably reach the pinnacle of Level Ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What bugged Osborne the most was the Fusion Vessel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had gotten a whole lot stronger, but he still couldn't get the third foundational carrier to sprout. That put a cap on his ability to merge more powers and boost the strength of his Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Guess I can't rush things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Let's just focus on getting through the city duel first! Once it's done, I'll have a month to kick back before the Zephyr State duel. I should be able to make a breakthrough by then!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, Osborne stepped out of his room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look who finally decided to show up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, a bunch of Mystic Sirius Sect disciples had gathered, practically bouncing with excitement as they waited for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment they spotted him, their enthusiasm was off the charts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hollered his name, and he grinned, waving back at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, d'you think you can make it into the top three in the city duel? We haven't had a top-three finisher in a hundred years!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, it all depends on you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've heard there's a dark horse named Leroy from Azure Haven Academy! And Marreese, last year's champ, is also in the game. Their lineup is seriously tough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rumor has it Azure Haven Academy is dead set on snagging the top two spots in this city duel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're so full of themselves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And we can't brush off Fantasia Isle either. They've got their own dark horse, Clara! And Tyson is no pushover..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, the honor of the Mystic Sirius Sect is on your shoulders!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't let them get the better of you!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
