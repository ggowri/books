  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tension in the auction hall thickened as everyone realized who had just called out the bid. It was Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His purpose for being here was clear&mdash;to rattle Kurt and ensure he didn't snag the Miracle Elixir at a bargain price. Timing it perfectly, he spoke up just as the auctioneer was about to drop the gavel, knowing it would irk Kurt even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt's anger flared as he shot a furious glance at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he held his tongue. He knew Osborne would come for him. After all, Osborne had proven his worth to be here with at least one hundred Celestial Crystals or ten thousand Ultimate Essence Crystals. That was fair game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Kurt felt no fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a member of the Baxter family, the son of a Supernal Deity King. He had never wanted for anything, especially not Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne had backed down, it would have been a different story. But no, Osborne's challenge only fueled Kurt's desire to put him in his place and show him the gulf between their standings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold smile, Kurt raised his paddle again. "Eleven thousand Ultimate Essence Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really, you think you can compete with me for the Miracle Elixir? You country bumpkin! How many Essence Crystals do you even have? Trying to challenge me is just asking for trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt's arrogance dripped from every word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, unfazed, "You're quite the showman, aren't you? But don't you have any Celestial Crystals? Using Ultimate Essence Crystals to bid? That doesn't quite match your status, does it? In this day and age, who even uses Ultimate Essence Crystals anymore?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne raised his paddle high. "Two hundred Celestial Crystals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gasps echoed through the crowd, shock rippling through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt's face flushed a deep red, a mix of embarrassment and rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "How dare this guy mock me for using Ultimate Essence Crystals while simultaneously raising the stakes to two hundred Celestial Crystals?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Does he not understand that a red Miracle Elixir is valued around a hundred Celestial Crystals?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would be foolish enough to bid two hundred for it? This is madness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he faced Osborne's taunting smile, Kurt felt the heat of frustration rise. He raised his paddle again, gritting his teeth. "You think you can intimidate me? I'm not afraid of you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just Celestial Crystals! I have plenty!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three hundred Celestial Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, let's see you keep up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shot a challenging look at Osborne, who merely smiled back, unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, finally showing some of that spoiled rich kid attitude! But it's a shame you're not quite there yet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, Osborne raised his paddle again, his voice steady. "Five hundred Celestial Crystals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd erupted in astonished whispers, eyes wide as they stared at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five hundred Celestial Crystals for a red Miracle Elixir?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was insane! The primary benefit of the red Miracle Elixir was to enhance cultivation, but for most, that wasn't a pressing concern. As long as they had potential, the elevation of their realm was merely a matter of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The red Miracle Elixir had always been the most affordable among all Miracle Elixirs, averaging around a hundred Celestial Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here was Osborne, bidding five times that amount.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers thought, "Is it really worth it just to get under Kurt's skin?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They regarded Osborne as if he'd lost his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Kurt was momentarily taken aback, staring at Osborne in disbelief before his expression morphed into one of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan, standing beside Osborne, felt a rush of anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Theodore, don't be reckless! There's no need to push things just to get back at Kurt! The red Miracle Elixir isn't worth that many Celestial Crystals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne just smiled serenely, his gaze fixed on Kurt. "Mr. Baxter, why so quiet now? You were just full of bravado a moment ago. Didn't you say I wasn't worthy to bid against you? Wasn't it you who bragged about your wealth?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what's the matter now? Scared to raise the stakes?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this what you call courage?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharpness of Osborne's words made Kurt's expression harden, but instead of lashing out, he responded with a cold, mocking smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You fool! Do you think I'm as dull as you are? Ha! Spending five hundred Celestial Crystals on a red Miracle Elixir? You must be joking!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I bet you're already regretting it. Now, you think by taunting me, I'll pump more money into your foolish bid?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're mistaken!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go ahead and take the elixir for five hundred Celestial Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enjoy your foolishness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he sat down, arms crossed, as if he had just won a battle of wits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, "Well, I have the money to spend, and I'm more than happy to let it go. You, on the other hand, are just trying to console yourself. I thought you were something special, all that talk about your wealth and power. But here you are, clearly rattled by five hundred Celestial Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Talk about disappointing! You'd do better to stay home. I'm embarrassed for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt felt his face flush crimson, anger simmering beneath the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clenched his jaw but said nothing, merely huffing in irritation as he settled in to wait for the next lot to be auctioned. Deep down, he vowed to teach Osborne a lesson he wouldn't forget.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in a twist that left Kurt reeling, the next three red Miracle Elixirs were auctioned off one after another. Each time, when Kurt placed his bid, Osborne steadfastly matched it, driving the price up to five hundred Celestial Crystals without an ounce of hesitation.</span></p><div class="pagination">
