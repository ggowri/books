  <div class="container"><p style="text-align:left;">After stating that firmly, Clarissa walked back to her room, locked the door, and diligently focused on improving her strength.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She knew that Osborne would go to the Paltrow Estate to take her away.</p><p style="text-align:left;">At that moment, he would encounter intense resistance from everyone in the Paltrow family and those who were related to them, putting himself in great danger.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Clarissa wouldn&#x27;t discourage Osborne from taking risks. All she needed to do was share the responsibility with him and stand by his side!</p><p style="text-align:left;">If everyone tried to stop them from being together, they would fight their way out.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The stronger Clarissa was, the less pressure Osborne would have to bear.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Therefore, she practiced hard.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She had already absorbed all the blood diamonds Osborne had given her, significantly increasing her strength. However, she kept this development to herself and continued to improve quietly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But she still didn&#x27;t feel her limit.</p><p style="text-align:left;">With only twenty days remaining, she understood becoming a Class A Power Master was out of reach for now.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Therefore, Clarissa was extremely pessimistic about the future.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Nonetheless, at the thought that Osborne must still be working hard silently behind the scenes, devising ways to be with her and whisk her away, she stopped dwelling on her feelings.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She just made every effort and left the rest to fate!</p><p style="text-align:left;">On the other side, Osborne returned to the Augustine Estate with a solemn expression.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Twenty days!</p><p style="text-align:left;">There were only twenty days left!</p><p style="text-align:left;">After that, Clarissa would be forced to marry Alexander, and the wedding would be held at the Paltrow Estate.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne would never allow this to happen. In twenty days, he must go there and take Clarissa away, regardless of the danger or the number of people who tried to stop him.​</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;It&#x27;s too close!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Even if I can become a Class A martial master now, stabilizing my newfound strength will take time! Twenty days might not be enough.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Moreover, even as a Class A martial master, I may not be a match for Alexander, let alone be able to rescue Clarissa from the Paltrow Estate.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;More preparations must be made!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne gritted his teeth, aware of the looming deadline. Without time to deal with the Maritime Auction in two days, he entrusted everything to Alison, Austin, and Brian, relying on them to handle it completely.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He locked himself in the room and began to strive to become a Class A martial master.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Reaching Class A was an extremely perilous thing for a metahuman or a martial artist because it was a completely different level.</p><p style="text-align:left;">That represented a significant advancement in life and a profound transformation of the soul. Only upon reaching Class A could one be regarded as a true master. In the eyes of Class A masters, those below them were as feeble as ants.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Throughout history, countless people had died from this challenge.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Among them, many were brilliant geniuses, but they still couldn&#x27;t overcome this hurdle.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Under normal circumstances, out of a hundred people attempting to reach Class A, only one could succeed.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Ninety of them would fail to control the overwhelming power during practice and would perish. The remaining nine might survive and achieve Class A-, but their advancement would halt for the rest of their lives.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne refused to confront death or settle for Class A-.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His goal was to be the one who successfully broke through to become a Class A martial master.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But he didn&#x27;t have much time to prepare.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He must take action immediately so that he could have the strength of a Class A martial master in twenty days to fight Alexander.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne thought, &quot;Let&#x27;s start!</p><p style="text-align:left;">No matter what, I will try my best! If I fail and die, that will be my fate!</p><p style="text-align:left;">But I will succeed!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He sat upright in the center of the room, initiating the mobilization of the intense power within his body to reach that elusive realm.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The martial art aura marked the biggest distinction between a Class A martial master and a Class B+ martial artist.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was condensed from the energy and blood throughout one&#x27;s entire body. Osborne&#x27;s task was to gather all his energy and blood, compress and continuously refine it, enabling it to transform.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Once it was successful, he would become a true Class A martial master.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But this process was very difficult.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Condensing one&#x27;s energy, blood, and strength into the martial art aura was exceptionally challenging. Even a minor mistake could lead to the collapse of energy and blood, resulting in death.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne had no choice but to move on with all his might.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Time passed slowly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne&#x27;s body gradually dried up. His muscles seemed to have lost all water and blood and became as dry as a branch.</p><p style="text-align:left;">This meant that he had already extracted all the energy, blood, and strength from his muscles and cells and began to condense them into the martial art aura.</p><p style="text-align:left;">No mistakes were allowed in the process.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Only when energy, blood, and strength were liberated from the confines of his body could they surpass their boundaries, expand infinitely, grow stronger, and even undergo profound changes in nature.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Finally, they were compressed back into his body, and the martial art aura burst out, which was considered a successful breakthrough.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne had now reached the critical step.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If he rushed forward, his body would become even more powerful and formidable.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If not, he would meet his doom!</p><div class="pagination">
