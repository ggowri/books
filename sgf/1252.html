  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The war between the Deschanel Clan and the League of Divine Descent had escalated into sheer chaos, both sides blinded by rage, itching to wipe each other out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Osborne, none of that mattered anymore&mdash;he was in rough shape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After stepping into the parallel space, he didn't dare linger. He hurriedly put distance between himself and the battlefield, finding a spot several hundred miles away before finally stopping to catch his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! If the League of Divine Descent ends up getting wiped out by the Deschanel Clan after all this, they'll have it coming!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've done all I can!" Osborne groaned, surveying the wreckage of his own body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half of him felt shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "The attack power of a Superior Deity is no joke! My Ethereal Glow and Divine Body are indeed powerful, but when stacked against a Superior Deity? There's a noticeable gap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But let's be real; the severity of my injuries is mostly my fault for being reckless and choosing to engage in close combat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I'd managed to keep my distance and fought freely, things might've gone differently!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite everything, Osborne felt a level of satisfaction with his abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a wild card, he had stirred the pot&mdash;creating a rift between the Deschanel Clan and the Pantheon League that was now unbridgeable. There would be no going back; they were committed to completely annihilating one another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before either clan could even think of tackling the Augustine family, they were going to exhaust themselves against each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought brought him some relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few injuries? Nothing compared to the greater picture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity on his side!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having completed the second stage of fusion, even if his Divine Body was obliterated, as long as his soul endured, Osborne could come back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the grand scheme of things, his current situation was hardly dire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne attempted to use the Light of Redemption to heal himself but soon found its effects on his battered Divine Body negligible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head in disappointment. "Looks like the Light of Redemption is just not cutting it anymore! My Divine Body is too powerful for it to restore fully! I'll have to rely on the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a mere thought, he summoned the immense power from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a trickle of its might sent waves of healing energy surging through him, rapidly knitting his fragmented body back together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity can bring someone back from the dead! This minor injury is nothing! This is exactly why I dared to stand my ground against that Superior Deity from the Deschanel Clan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time at all, Osborne's wounds had mended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder how the battle between the Deschanel Clan and the Pantheon League is going? I really laid a heavy hit on those two Superior Deities. That should've tilted the odds quite a bit, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if the Pantheon League can't win, they shouldn't be utterly wiped out now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne resolved to check back in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's hope those two Superior Deities got taken out! One Superior Deity's blood energy is probably worth dozens of Intermediate Deities. Enough to help hundreds of Blood Demon members ascend to divinity! If both of those Superior Deities are gone..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pictured the potent blood energy and activated his interdimensional travel, reappearing near the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he arrived, the fight was still raging on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Osborne had predicted, those two battered Superior Deities fell quickly under the relentless assault of the Pantheon League warriors, unable to fend off their attackers without reinforcements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chaos was palpable, and even Osborne struggled to gauge who was gaining the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of divine beings on the battlefield had thinned considerably, with both sides bruised and battered but far from ready to back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the Pantheon League's side, around seventy to eighty deities remained. This included one Superior Deity, about twenty Intermediate Deities, and the rest were Junior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In stark contrast, the Deschanel Clan had dwindled down to just eighteen members&mdash;four Superior Deities and fourteen Intermediate Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the span of this vicious conflict, they had lost half of their thirty-six deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne himself had personally eliminated six of them, two of which were Superior Deities that he had gravely wounded before their demise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was fair to say that he had single-handedly turned the tide of the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This state of affairs left Osborne feeling quite pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With both sides seemingly balanced, he hesitated for a moment but ultimately decided against making any further moves. His involvement carried the risk of exposing himself, and Osborne preferred to avoid any unnecessary complications.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, it was time to collect blood energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne began to weave through the chaotic battlefield, silently absorbing the rich, thick blood energy surrounding him. This energy, which would dissipate over time, was ripe for the taking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he consumed it gradually, he drew no attention; after all, everyone else was too preoccupied with the fierce fighting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a major score!" Osborne thought, excitement bubbling within him as he gathered the blood energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clash between the Deschanel Clan and the Pantheon League had been nothing short of intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The casualties among the divine warriors had reached over a hundred, including two Superior Deities and more than twenty Intermediate Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne calculated quickly in his mind. The blood energy harvested from just one Intermediate Deity could elevate up to twenty members of the Blood Demon faction to the ranks of divinity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, a single Superior Deity's blood energy was equivalent to that of twenty Intermediate Deities, enough to empower four hundred Blood Demon members to forge their Divine Bodies and ascend as gods!</span></p><div class="pagination">
