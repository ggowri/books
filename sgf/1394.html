  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was rapidly healing Osborne's injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel his Divine Body regaining strength, and now he could unleash more power&mdash;at least enough to handle ordinary Junior Deities without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This realization filled him with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "First, I need to let the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity recover fully, then I can use it to heal my wounds. That was the right call. Once it absorbs all the high-grade death scent in this area, my recovery will be even better!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially from that Intermediate Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The high-grade death scent left behind when it falls will be richer, allowing the Lotus to heal even more! With my current strength, I wouldn't stand a chance against an Intermediate Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>. But if I can ride on Vance and Harry's coattails to take one down, I'll get that high-grade death scent and speed up the Lotus' recovery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe soon enough, I'll be strong enough to take on an Intermediate Deity myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he thought about this, Osborne's face lit up with eagerness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed his gaze on the Intermediate Deity, waiting for it to be defeated so he could send the Lotus to absorb the high-grade death scent left in its wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Vance's five companions had already been dispatched by the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their blood and flesh were being devoured in a gruesome spectacle by the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, which was growing stronger with each meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the fate of those </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> was no better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry quickly sprang into action, dispatching them with ruthless efficiency. Now, only the Intermediate Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> remained, relentlessly assaulting Vance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vance was in a dire state, bloodied and barely holding on, his eyes losing focus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was no match for the Intermediate Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear to everyone that Vance couldn't last much longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vance cried out, desperation lacing his voice, "Harry, please! Help me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're from the same village, I'm begging you! I don't want to die! I know I messed up. I'm really sorry! I apologize to you and your sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just save me! If you do, I swear I'll serve you both, I'll do anything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry couldn't help but let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vance, is this really the time to beg for mercy? Don't you think it's a bit late for that? </span><span>You expect me to believe your sob story? You know you were wrong? That's rich!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I save you, you'd probably turn around and sell us out in a heartbeat! It's better for you to just die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry's icy words left Vance in utter despair, and he turned his pleading gaze to Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, please! I know you're reasonable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're from the same village, after all. The Rodriguez Village is small enough as it is. You can't just stand by and watch me die! I'm begging you, save me! </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> are our true enemies. I really see my mistakes now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry's expression darkened. "Amelia, don't listen to him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia </span><span>nodded,</span><span> her tone calm yet resolute. "Don't worry, Harry. I'm kind-hearted, but I'm not foolish. I've seen through Vance for a long time. I won't let my compassion cloud my judgment. If he lives, he'll only bring us trouble down the line."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Harry finally relaxed a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smirked at Vance. "Vance, save your breath! We're not going to save you. You brought this on yourself. If you didn't want to deal with us, why did you come here? Why are you surrounded by </span><span>Deathborns</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you were even scheming against my sister? You're nothing but a scoundrel. Just die already!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Vance was plunged into complete despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vance's eyes blazed with fury. "Harry, Amelia, you'll get what's coming to you! If I die here, you won't get off easy either! Let me tell you the truth: Patrick is actually my sister's husband. If I die, he'll come looking for answers, and he'll find out about you two!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When that happens, you're finished!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> I suggest you save me right now. As long as I'm alive, there's hope for you. If I die, you two will only suffer more! Don't forget, your father was part of the resistance! In Zone Nine, you have no chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vance's furious shout sent a chill through Harry and Amelia, their expressions shifting to one of grave concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even with the threat hanging over them, they still didn't move to help him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way they would save Vance. Even if Patrick, the overseer, did come looking for them after Vance's death, they wouldn't risk their lives for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! Harry, Amelia, I'll be waiting for you in hell!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll get what you deserve!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Patrick will avenge me; you won't escape his wrath! </span><span>Ahhh</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vance's anguished screams echoed in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a final, desperate struggle, Vance fought with all his might, but he was no match for the Intermediate Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>. With a swift motion, the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> tore through his chest, ripping out his heart and devouring it in one greedy bite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vance was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia, now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Harry and Amelia sprang into action. They joined forces to take down the wounded Intermediate Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, and with their combined strength, </span><span>they quickly dispatched the creature.</span></p><div class="pagination">
