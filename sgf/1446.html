  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Ms. Hannah Gellar would rather marry a young warrior from the Human Community, wouldn't she? She's determined to use her broken body to reshape the Human Community's standing in Celestara and even change our relations with the other races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have the utmost respect and sincere gratitude for Ms. Hannah Gellar and her noble aspirations. Thank you for her willingness to do such things for the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since this is about Ms. Hannah Gellar's marriage, shouldn't we consider her own wishes? Under such circumstances, my grandson Lachlan is clearly the best choice for her. The Swift family holds enough influence within the Human Community, and I believe Ms. Hannah Gellar will choose my grandson Lachlan," Walter declared confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Mystic Feather Clan exchanged glances but didn't argue, whispering among themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint veil of divine power surrounded them, muffling their conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter didn't rush them; he simply maintained his warm smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne couldn't help but frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, Walter and the Mystic Feather Clan were discussing his potential marriage into their ranks. Walter wanted him to marry a woman named Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It sounded like she had health issues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne found himself intrigued by this Hannah. Walter had mentioned her ideal of using her frail body to improve the Human Community's situation in Celestara and alter its relations with the other races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that were true, Osborne would feel a sense of admiration for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It might even change his perspective on the Dark Deity races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least, it proved that not everyone from that faction was bad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he was unwilling to marry this Hannah or join the Mystic Feather Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do I refuse?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I can't turn them down, does that mean I have to give up my identity as Lachlan?" Osborne pondered, his brow furrowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he noticed many around him casting curious glances his way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some looked envious, while others wore smirks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan, congratulations are in order! You're about to marry Ms. Hannah Gellar from the Gellar family! She's quite the big deal over at East floating mountain! Once you marry her and join the Gellar family, you could be living there too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before you know it, you'll be a big shot yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the Gellar family has already promised that if you marry Ms. Hannah Gellar, they'll use their resources and connections to help you grow. Who knows? You might rise to become a centurion, a chiliarch, or even a leader of ten thousand in no time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm so envious of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced at the speakers, realizing they were all young members of the Swift family, core members like himself. They were all roughly on the same level as Lachlan, making them competitors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was Lachlan who had been chosen for this marriage alliance with the Mystic Feather Clan, which naturally stirred feelings of envy and frustration among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially when they thought about how Lachlan would soon have the Gellar family's backing, propelling him ahead in status, power, and strength, their envy only deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when they remembered Hannah's situation, their expressions turned a bit mocking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them said, a teasing glint in their eye, "I've heard Ms. Hannah Gellar is quite beautiful, but it's a shame she has her issues. She's been blind since childhood and can't see a thing. Plus, she has trouble with her legs and can't stand on her own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan, if you really marry Ms. Hannah Gellar, you'll have to take good care of her. You'll be pushing her around for walks, keeping her spirits up, and helping her with everything&mdash;bathing, massages&hellip; you'll have your hands full! If she's willing to look your way, you better treat her like royalty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the jibe hung in the air, laughter erupted among the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah was a disabled woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for that, how could the Gellar family&mdash;one of the most powerful factions within the Mystic Feather Clan&mdash;ever consider a union with someone from the Human Community?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the Mystic Feather Clan didn't outright disdain or belittle the Human Community, the power gap between the Swift family and the Gellar family was simply too vast. They were on entirely different levels; a marriage alliance wouldn't come easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Hannah had her heart set on marrying someone from the Human Community, the Gellar family would never allow it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Hannah were whole and healthy, young elites from the various powerful factions would be lining up at the Gellar family's door, eager to propose. There was no way someone like Lachlan would even be in the running.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a frown tugging at his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never considered marrying into the Mystic Feather Clan or tying himself to Hannah, but he couldn't stand the way these people were mocking her disability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to hold back any longer, he snapped, "Enough with your nonsense!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hannah Gellar may have her challenges, but she's far more noble than any of you! She isn't even from the Human Community, yet she genuinely wants to help us build a harmonious relationship with the other races and improve our standing in Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what have you done as members of the Human Community? All you do is look down on your own kind, treating them with scorn and arrogance!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
