  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The unique energy from Emma's Death's Stare flowed between the two during their close contact, circulating within their bodies and altering their brain neurons.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a result, their perception gradually improved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Throughout this process, their brain neurons became incredibly active, causing their perception to increase tenfold, even a hundredfold, in a short time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After their intense battle, both entered a state of cultivation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne continued his focus on comprehending the Lightning Domain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He felt that he was only one step away from mastering the Lightning Domain. With his neurons so active and his perception heightened tenfold, it took him very little effort to finally grasp the Lightning Domain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Buzz!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Countless electric sparks flashed through the room, and Osborne felt as though he had become one with the lightning, drawing immense power from it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Within the Lightning Domain, he could freely unleash Judgment Thunder and Thunder Explosion with incredible speed and minimal energy consumption. It's almost like a god-wielding lightning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, like his Spatial Domain, the Lightning Domain was still unstable since he had only just mastered it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne frowned as he began to ponder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The power of domains is strong and greatly enhances me, but they aren't stable enough. Against opponents of the same level, they can easily be shattered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Once shattered, it causes a mental backlash!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"For now, mastering three domains is enough to handle most situations, and someone else's domain won't easily counter me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What I need to focus on is not mastering more domains, but making my Spatial and Lightning Domains more stable so they won't be easily shattered!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne thought about possible solutions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His Light Domain was very stable. Osborne decided to start there, using its structure as a model to improve both his Spatial and Lightning Domains.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With his extraordinary heightened perception, Osborne quickly identified the unique aspects of his Light Domain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A domain is like weaving a net of energy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Each strand of energy is like a cord. The domain becomes much more stable when they intertwine like a woven net!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But this is difficult!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne murmured to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His Light Domain's energy was woven together, forming a solid whole that wouldn't easily break under strong impact.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But his Spatial and Lightning Domains lacked that structure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne wanted to weave his Spatial and Lightning Domains together, but he found it difficult. His Spatial and Lightning Elemental Essences weren't strong enough for such complex manipulation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How can I make my Spatial and Lightning Elemental Essences stronger?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne thought deeply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, an idea struck him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Maybe the power of the stars can help!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Isa once said that the power of the stars is starlight, and all energy in this world comes from starlight brought from the cosmos!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Absorbing the power of the stars enhances my body and soul because that starlight contains energy capable of strengthening both.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since all energy comes from starlight, could there be some force within it that could enhance my elemental essence?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can star power enhance my elemental essence?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne grew excited at the thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He decided to give it a try.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Activating Satan's Eye, Osborne used his ocular energy to capture the starlight from the heavens, absorbing it into his body. Instead of strengthening his body and soul this time, he directed the power into his elemental essence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne first tested it on his Spatial Elemental Essence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His space elemental essence had been obtained by absorbing enemies and wasn't very strong. In fact, it was the weakest of all his elemental essences.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, because spatial powers were inherently strong, Osborne had focused on mastering them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can it be strengthened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne murmured to himself as he guided the power of the stars into contact with his space elemental essence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Buzz!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instantly, his space elemental essence began to tremble, as though excited, and quickly wrapped itself around the starlight energy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne could feel that his space elemental essence was absorbing some form of energy from the starlight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's really working?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was thrilled. His hypothesis was correct! The power of the stars truly did contain energy that could enhance his elemental essence. He could feel his space elemental essence growing stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If others were to witness this rate of improvement, they'd be utterly stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this pace, his space elemental essence would soon become his strongest essence, second only to his Light Elemental Essence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wouldn't be long before he could use a woven technique to stabilize his Spatial Domain!</p><div class="pagination">
