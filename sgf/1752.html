  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within the vast palace of the Bowman family, Maxine listened intently to his subordinate's report, his expression as cold and fierce as ever, a simmering rage boiling beneath the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, the Stellar Pursuit Mandate has been issued, and various clans have already mobilized. The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings are as good as dead! The moment they show their faces, they'll be met with a relentless hunt from the super talents and warriors of the clans. They won't be able to escape!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The rewards we've put on the table are too enticing; even if the Seven try to flee back to the West Zone, they won't find it easy. The Human Community there isn't a solid front; many are secretly colluding with us. For the right price, they won't hesitate to eliminate the Seven to claim their rewards."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine nodded, his gaze fixed on the speaker&mdash;a strikingly handsome young man whose calm demeanor masked an undeniable arrogance in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He certainly had every right to be arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Tristram Bowman, the first heir of the Bowman family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of talent, potential, and capability, Tristram far surpassed Alfred, his cousin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Younger than Alfred, he had already broken through to the Deity King realm, making him the undisputed champion among the younger generation of the Bowman family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in the Paramount Supreme Clan, he would rank among the top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Tristram, Maxine's icy demeanor softened considerably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of contemplation, he spoke, "Tristram, are you willing to personally head to Wild Flame City in the East Zone? I can arrange for two late-stage Deity King warriors to protect you. As the first heir of the Bowman family, it's crucial that we reclaim our honor after your cousin was killed by the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must confront them, defeat them, and restore our family's reputation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you succeed, when you return, you will be the sole heir of the Bowman family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A spark of determination flickered in Tristram's eyes as he nodded firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rest assured, Grandpa! I will reclaim all the face and glory that Alfred lost! If given the chance, I'll capture the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings alive! They won't stand a chance against me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With confidence radiating from him, Tristram added, "I won't let you down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine nodded approvingly. "Then go! Remember, the honor of the Bowman family cannot be tarnished again! If you fail, don't bother coming back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!" Tristram bowed respectfully and turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, he stood atop the Supreme Malevolence Airship, flanked by two formidable late-stage Deity King warriors, as they swiftly departed from the Bowman family stronghold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in a nearby tower, Alaric Bowman watched with a scowl as Tristram's airship took off. Anguish and anger twisted his expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, why do you favor Tristram so? I am also an heir of the Bowman family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why is he the one sent to confront the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings while I'm left behind? Do you doubt my strength? I am just as capable as he is!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you said that when Tristram returns, he'll be the sole heir?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! What does that make me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I refuse to sit idly by while he gets all the glory! I'm going to the East Zone to hunt down the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll prove to you that I can accomplish what Tristram can and even what he cannot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am the best heir of the Bowman family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that declaration, a shroud of dark energy enveloped Alaric, and in the blink of an eye, he vanished from sight, determined to carve his own path and stake his claim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, the East Zone buzzed with activity as massive Malevolence Airships sped through the sky, filling the atmosphere over Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These colossal vessels, numbering in the thousands, hovered ominously above the city, casting dark shadows over the streets below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of these airships was an Ultimate Malevolence Airship, sent forth by various factions, most of them belonging to the top ten Upper Races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The airships were lined with powerful and proud figures, their majestic presence looming over the citizens of Wild Flame City. The sheer intensity of their auras pressed down like a physical weight, making even the bravest warriors feel small and hesitant to breathe too deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wild Flame City had never been so alive with such fierce energy before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, figures began zipping from the airships, unfurling their power as they made their way toward the Mystic Feather Clan's floating mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they landed, they were greeted by an unsettling silence. The floating mountain lay eerily empty, a stark reminder of the catastrophic battle that had recently taken place. The remnants of the conflict were everywhere&mdash;crumbled ruins, shattered earth, and patches of dried blood that marked the ground like cruel scars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the newcomers was a dragon-like creature radiating crackling electricity, its contemptuous voice slicing through the silence. "So, Alfred and Aldrich were taken down right here by the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speaker was Orson, a super genius from the Thunderstorm Drake Clan, his arrogance unmistakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Orson, you're quicker than a lightning bolt!" A voice came from beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man with three striking white fox tails appeared, a smirk dancing on his face. "This must be the spot! Honestly, Alfred was such a waste. He's an heir of the Bowman family, yet he never managed to break into the Deity King realm. What a loser! He relied on the Supreme Malevolence Sword and Shield to act tough. He got what he deserved!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
