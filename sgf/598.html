  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strange white light suddenly shot out from Emma's snow-white right eye. It was swift, hitting Aria in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria clutched her head and let out a painful scream. Blood flowed from her eyes, nose, mouth, and ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, the crimson light Aria had shot out also hit Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma was completely drained of strength and could only let the crimson light strike her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thump!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next second, both Aria and Emma collapsed, unable to hold on any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their bodies lay motionless on the ground, neither of them moving for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers were all dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did they... kill each other?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle had unfolded too quickly for anyone to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Buzz!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Godfather and Everett moved simultaneously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aria's body flew in front of Everett. He frowned and gently pressed on her head. Aria coughed up a mouthful of blood and finally regained consciousness, but her face was deathly pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gritted her teeth and tried to use Detoxify on herself, but it had no effect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Death's Stare?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a powerful attack, even Detoxify has no effect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett frowned coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather ignored Everett, placing his hand on Emma's head. Emma coughed up blood and slowly regained consciousness, her face pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather praised her, "You did well. Very well. However, even though you possess Death's Stare, you shouldn't have resisted the Satan's Eye. Find some time to awaken your own Satan's Eye. The combination of Death's Stare and Satan's Eye will make you even more formidable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma bit her lip upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The method of awakening the Satan's Eye is unacceptable to me! At least for now, I haven't seen any man worthy of me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family's inherited power, Satan's Eye, requires sexual intercourse between a man and a woman to awaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Satan's Eye was only awakened after he started living with Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma was unwilling to awaken her Satan's Eye, partly because she already possessed the equally powerful Death's Stare and partly because of her pride; she looked down on all the men she had met.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She refused to casually offer her body to just any man in order to awaken Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather was taken aback for a moment, then couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're a good girl. Let it be. Keep working hard, I have high hopes for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, Emma's eyes were filled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather was her idol!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To receive his recognition made her feel that all these years of hard work had finally paid off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bowed respectfully and then walked back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Vincent, Matthew, and Owen were all looking at her, their eyes filled with envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They yearned for Godfather's recognition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But so far, only Emma had truly earned his praise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were so jealous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma, however, paid them no mind. She returned to her seat and fixed her gaze on Aria across from her, the fighting spirit in her eyes still ablaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everett, let's call this a draw. What do you think?" Godfather said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett snorted, "A draw it is. I have no objections! I underestimated your little girl. I didn't expect her to be able to hold her own against Aria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unfortunately, she's out of the running now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The rest of you Augustines don't stand a chance against me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished speaking, Lance and Sam's faces darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett had belittled them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Everett was a Class S Supreme Overlord, on equal footing with Godfather. Though enraged, they dared not retort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather smiled faintly, "I said it's too early to tell who will win or lose! The two strongest members of your Rosenthal family have already been defeated. We Augustines may not necessarily lose."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett sneered, "Then we shall wait and see!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's continue!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The third battle finally commenced, with Sam representing the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His opponent was a young man of similar age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am Aresta Rosenthal, ranked thirteenth among the Godson of Yalynch. You're no match for me, better surrender now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam snorted in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Surrender? I'm afraid you don't have what it takes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Sam charged forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His opponent was a Godson of Yalynch, and Sam had no confidence in victory. He could only give it his all, hoping to exhaust his opponent at least and make things easier for Lance, who would fight next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Transformation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ancient berserk bear!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ninefold Tide Crash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Sam unleashed his full power, transforming into a five-meter-tall giant bear, amplifying his strength. He launched his most potent attack, the Ninefold Waves, with a ferocious punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was his most potent attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aresta, standing opposite, sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also clenched his fist and threw a punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ah!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Sam let out a bloodcurdling scream. In the clash of power, he had lost wholly and utterly. He was sent flying, his thick arm twisted into a grotesque shape, bones protruding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His formidable defense proved useless at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thud!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sam crashed heavily to the ground, unable to get up for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had been defeated in a single move!</span></p><div class="pagination">
