  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, another roar came, seemingly much closer to Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression turned serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said anxiously, "Oh, no! Why are you still standing there? Hurry up and run. I told you long ago something was off here. You got caught stealing the flowers."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This beast's roar is suspicious. Hurry and escape as fast as you can. But make sure not to leave any energy fluctuations. We'll talk as we go."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial's</span><span> voice calmed Osborne down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He nodded and quickly fled south. Fortunately, his control over power had reached a very high level. If he didn&rsquo;t want to leave any energy fluctuations, even someone much stronger than him wouldn&rsquo;t be able to track him through them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The roar sounded again, and it was closer now, seemingly coming from east to west. Within this beastly roar, Osborne felt all the surrounding volcanoes grow even more violent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Osborne fled south, he anxiously asked, "Primordial, what's wrong with this beastly roar? Besides being sharp and piercing, what else is the problem?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said coldly, "The problem is significant. If I'm not mistaken, this is the roar of a Silicon-based Lifeform."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned, his eyes wide open. "Silicon-based Lifeform? Are you sure? Does such a thing really exist in this world?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was very surprised, and of course, he knew what a Silicon-based Lifeform was.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Silicon-based Lifeform is a life form built around a silicon elemental core. However, Osborne had never seen one before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial sneered, "Isn't it perfectly normal for Silicon-based Lifeforms to exist in the world? Compared to that, it's a miracle that we Carbon-based Lifeforms can thrive so well in the cosmos."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne was stunned, thinking, "Really?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said, "It seems I need to educate you about the composition of lifeforms in the cosmos."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and listened carefully to </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial continued, "In the vast cosmos, there are various creatures. But structurally, all lifeforms are divided into three types: Carbon-based Lifeforms, Silicon-based Lifeforms, and Singular Lifeforms."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We all belong to Carbon-based Lifeforms because the most basic atoms that make up our bodies are carbon atoms. Carbon-based Lifeforms can be roughly divided into four major races: Spirit Clan, Beast Clan, Bug Clan, and Plant Clan."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Among them, the Spirit Clan is considered the strongest group in the cosmos. Not only are they numerous, but they are also very powerful, having ruled the cosmos for the longest time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Spirit Clan?" Osborne murmured. He had never heard of this group.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said speechlessly, "You belong to the Spirit Clan. The most representative Spirit Clans are the Angel Clan, Elf Race, and Human Community."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?" Osborne was utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Human Community, Elf Race, and Angel Clan all belong to the Spirit Clan? The Spirit Clan is the most powerful group in the cosmos and has ruled the cosmos for the longest time?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said calmly, "Of course. Otherwise, why do those Beast Clan, Bug Clan, and even our Plant Clan like to transform into forms similar to the Human Community? Do we not like our original forms? Do we not like showing our true forms to others?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No. It's because the Spirit Clan rules the cosmos. So, the Beast Clan, Bug Clan, and Plant Clan all have to transform into forms similar to the Human Community."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If the Beast Clan ruled the cosmos, we would have to transform into the Beast Clan's form to align with them. Similarly, if the Bug Clan ruled the cosmos, we would have to take on the Bug Clan's form."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne opened his mouth wide. He had never really thought about this question.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After recalling, he realized that the creatures of different races he encountered seemed to transform into human-like forms, at most retaining some racial traits.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "So, it's because the Spirit Clan rules the cosmos."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial continued, "The Spirit Clan is the most intelligent and the most potential-filled race. Moreover, the Spirit Clan's reproductive ability is not weak, and many Sovereign Masters have emerged from them. That's why the Spirit Clan can rule the cosmos."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Beast Clan, though less intelligent than the Spirit Clan, has stronger bodies and similarly strong reproductive abilities. The Sacred Dragon Clan, Sacred Tiger Clan, and Ember Phoenix Clan are powerful representatives of the Beast Clan. Many Sovereign Masters have also emerged from the Beast Clan, placing them second in the cosmos."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial continued, "The third is the Bug Clan. The Bug Clan's intelligence and potential are not high, but their reproductive ability is terrifying. However, they don't like coexisting with the Spirit Clan or Beast Clan and often occupy a region alone to develop independently."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Few Sovereign Masters are born in the Bug Clan, but each one is incredibly terrifying, capable of commanding countless Bug Clan warriors. In short, the Bug Clan ranks third in the cosmos."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The fourth is the Plant Clan. Their numbers are too scarce. Even fewer Plant Clan members can awaken intelligence and possess great power. Although many Sovereign Masters have emerged from the Plant Clan, due to their limited numbers, they can only rank fourth in the cosmos."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course, that's because I haven't fully awakened yet. If I gather the Tree Heart energy from all the other World Tree offshoots, I can become the true World Tree. By then, I can greatly elevate the status of the Plant Clan in the cosmos."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, Primordial looked incredibly proud.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne frowned and said, "Primordial, what level is Sovereign Master? Is it Sovereign Level after Empyrean Sacredness?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial replied with a smile, "How could it be Sovereign Level after Empyrean Sacredness? Sovereign Level is the highest rank in the cosmos. Even in the deepest parts of the cosmos, Sovereign Level warriors are incredibly rare."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They are the true Masters, ruling the cosmos. Warriors at the level of Empyrean Sacredness are mere ants before them. With just a thought, they can easily kill countless top-tier warriors at Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They are the ones who truly master the rules. They even wield the essence power of the cosmos and create the rules."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> eyes were filled with longing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne opened his mouth wide, thinking, "They can easily kill countless top-tier warriors at Empyrean Sacredness with just a thought? Sovereign Level is simply terrifying."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"One day, I will also become a Sovereign Level warrior, a Master of the cosmos, and take control of my own destiny," Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial gave Osborne a deep look, then sneered, "Forget it! Your talent is indeed good, but you can never become a Master."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Human Community is the weakest existence in the Spirit Clan. Both the Elf Race and Angel Clan have produced Sovereign Masters, but not a single one in the Human Community."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You belong to the Human Community. So, from the day you were born, it was already destined that you could not become a Master."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned tightly, thinking, "Has there never been a Master in the Human Community?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
