  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The power of the ritual was incredibly mysterious. No one could clearly explain how the ritual process occurred, not even a top warrior at the level of Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the ritual did have an effect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Glorious Divine Kingdom held a ritual every ten years, personally presided over by the emperor of Glorious Divine Kingdom, who was Osborne's father in his previous life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, all members of the Glorious Divine Kingdom's Royal Family and high-ranking officials had to attend, and many warriors were even invited to observe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his previous life, Osborne didn&rsquo;t know why this was done and even found it somewhat boring.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne now believes that the reason Glorious Divine Kingdom could become one of the three top-tier powers on the Racial Convergence Planet and remain strong for tens of thousands of years must be greatly attributed to the ritual held every ten years.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even his father's immense strength was related to the ritual, as his father's power would significantly increase after each ceremony.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was attempting the ritual for the first time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could feel an inexplicably terrifying power emerging within the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg. This power was being rapidly absorbed by the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg, and the vitality it emitted grew increasingly stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn&rsquo;t know if this would succeed. He was merely a medium providing blood to initiate the ritual. Once the ritual began, he could no longer intervene.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It all depended on the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg itself now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it hatched before the ritual ended, it could live. If not, it would become a sacrifice of the ritual, losing all vitality and power, turning into a dead egg.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, with a buzzing sound, the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg suddenly emitted an even more intense blood-red glow. Within this blood-red light, golden, silver, and blue hues flickered, the four colors alternating continuously. In the end, red dominated, while the other three colors became mere accents.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A terrifying vitality burst out from the eggshell. Osborne even sensed a faint figure emerging within the shell. It was an incredibly ferocious figure with three heads and six pairs of wings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The figure was slowly writhing, seemingly trying to break the eggshell and emerge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this scene, Osborne immediately felt immense joy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial exclaimed, "The </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon has taken shape. The next moment is crucial. If it can break out of the shell, it will succeed. If not, everything is over."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Saying this, Primordial was extremely tense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was even more nervous because he could feel the ritual had reached its later stages, and the mysterious force in the void was rapidly diminishing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Is the remaining power enough for the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon to fully form, then break the shell and emerge from it?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't know!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one knew!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he stared intently at the figure of the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon inside the eggshell, watching it wriggle more and more agilely, seeing it finally seem to realize its situation and start clawing at the eggshell.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The figure repeatedly clawed at the eggshell, producing thudding sounds. But Osborne could tell its claws weren't sharp enough. The eggshell was too tough. Each clash of the claws against the shell caused only slight tremors, unable to break it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Osborne felt the power of the ritual vanish.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, no!" Osborne said anxiously, "The ritual is about to end, but the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon still hasn't gained enough strength to break the eggshell. What should I do now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne looked at Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said helplessly, "How would I know what to do? How about giving it a bit more of your blood?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gritting his teeth, Osborne quickly used the Warfare Scythe to cut his wrist again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A large amount of blood splattered out, making Osborne's face turn slightly pale. However, the blood on the eggshell was not absorbed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is useless!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned deeply, anxiously watching as the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon's figure collided with the eggshell from inside again and again, yet failed to break through.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The power of the ritual has vanished. This means the ritual is about to end.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne could even feel the life force of the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg rapidly weakening. The figure of the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon inside the eggshell also seemed to grow increasingly feeble, with its movements becoming slower and slower.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Did we fail?" Osborne looked bewildered and unwilling. But he had no way out, only able to watch the life force of the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg rapidly weaken.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Primordial gritted his teeth and said, "Why don't you just break the eggshell from the outside? Since the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon lacks the strength to break it from within, you can help it from the outside. Using the Warfare Scythe might work."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne instantly became excited. Without stopping to consider whether </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> words were reliable, he immediately swung the Warfare Scythe and struck the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg hard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The six-foot-long Warfare Scythe was incredibly sharp. Instantly, a crack appeared on the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the crack was too small.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said in shock, "How can it be so tough? Even the Warfare Scythe can't break the eggshell?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial frowned and said, "It's not because the eggshell is too hard, nor because the Warfare Scythe isn't sharp enough, but because your strength isn't powerful enough to unleash the full potential of the Warfare Scythe. Stop wasting time and keep striking it. You must break the eggshell quickly, or the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg will surely die."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and furiously hacked at the eggshell.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he was using all his strength. He believed that even a top-grade Defensive Sacred Artifact in front of him would be split open by him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon's eggshell was too hard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its defense was definitely stronger than a top-grade Defensive Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's strength wasn't enough. Although he could leave marks on the eggshell each time, it would take him a long time to completely split it open.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But right now, what they lacked most was time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne felt the life force of the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg had become extremely weak. The </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon's figure had even stopped moving.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "The ritual is about to end. The </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg is dead."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne fell into despair.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial's</span><span> gaze instantly dimmed, thinking, "Did we ultimately fail after all?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What a pity!" Primordial sighed, then wanted to stop Osborne and comfort him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, the transparent coffin stored in Osborne's Dimensional Space reappeared before him, emitting a faint glow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Osborne could react, the transparent coffin suddenly slammed into the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a crack, the shell of the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon Egg was shattered by the transparent coffin. Instantly, a faint life force spread from within the shell, growing stronger and stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"End the ritual quickly!" Primordial said anxiously, "Osborne, the eggshell has been broken. You must end the ritual immediately, or the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon will be sacrificed as an offering."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had no time to rejoice and immediately stopped the ritual.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instantly, Osborne spat out a mouthful of blood, his aura dimming drastically as he suffered a backlash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, the </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon inside the eggshell moved again, raising its sharp claws.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a crack, the eggshell was completely shattered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, a juvenile </span><span>Astralwreck</span><span> Dragon slowly crawled out of the eggshell.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It had three heads and six pairs of wings, looking incredibly ferocious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, it spotted Osborne with its massive eyes.</span></p><div class="pagination">
