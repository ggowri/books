  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they approached the Mystic Sirius Sect, Osborne summoned Clarissa, Emma, Anastasia, and the others, instructing them to conclude their seclusion and emerge from Hope Haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the foreseeable future, they would all need to remain on Racial Convergence Planet and establish a visible identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, you're all </span><span>gonna</span><span> be disciples of the Mystic Sirius Sect," Osborne announced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Along with them were Tyrese and five other guys who were also leaving Hope Haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were already part of the Mystic Sirius Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Guided by Maddox, the eight of them had taken off for </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet to give Lord Malevolence a hand. Sadly, Ricky kicked the bucket. The other seven ended up becoming Osborne's Blood Golems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Lord, you wait here. We'll head back to the sect and fill them in. The Mystic Sirius Sect isn't too uptight with its rules. With our word, you'll definitely get in," Maddox said politely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Go on! And from now on, just call me by my name. No need to make a big deal about our relationship."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it!" Maddox answered right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he led Tyrese and the other five out of the Sanctum of Night and flew towards a huge valley in the distance. Soon, they went through a shiny barrier and vanished from Osborne's view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with Osborne's Satan's Eye, he couldn't see through that watery-looking thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew the Mystic Sirius Sect was </span><span>hidden</span><span> behind it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what's the deal with joining the Mystic Sirius Sect? Becoming disciples means we'll be tied down by their rules. It's way less chill than being free here! We've been doing great training in Hope Haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've got tons of Element Gold Crystals and Sacred Crystals, and with that hundred-fold time acceleration, our cultivation resources are way better than those of the Mystic Sirius Sect disciples. We've been making good progress!" Anastasia asked, looking totally confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others looked at her, just as bewildered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne grinned. "I'm not having you join the Mystic Sirius Sect to use their training resources. We just need the identity of </span><span>the </span><span>Mystic Sirius Sect disciples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we don't have a proper ID, there are a whole bunch of things we won't be able to get in on! You'll figure out more about Racial Convergence Planet soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just trust me for now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright!" Anastasia nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was still a bit unsure, but she was willing to go along with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Osborne wouldn't lead them astray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd insisted on coming to Racial Convergence Planet with him, so they'd cooperate and not be a pain in the neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group got themselves settled and patiently waited after stashing the Sanctum of Night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>About half an hour later, Maddox came back, all smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Lord... Osborne, it's all set! My teacher, Elder Earvin </span><span>Corenswet</span><span>, has given the green light for you to join the Mystic Sirius Sect. Now, let's head inside and get your identity tokens sorted out. Once that's done, you'll be inner disciples of the sect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne grinned and nodded. "Let's roll!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox took the lead. As they went through the shimmering barrier, he pulled out a light-purple token. There was a fierce, winged wolf engraved on it&mdash;that was the emblem of the Mystic Sirius Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other side, it said "Inner Disciple Maddox".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This token was the ticket to being recognized as a Mystic Sirius Sect disciple and getting into the sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With it, they could move around the realm. Wherever they went, showing the Mystic Sirius Sect token would let everyone know they were part of the sect and </span><span>ensure</span><span> they were protected under the sect's name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne and his crew followed Maddox into the Mystic Sirius Sect, they were immediately blown away by the jaw-dropping beauty that </span><span>lay before them</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wild storms that used to rage were gone. Instead, there were towering peaks reaching up into the sky, colorful flowers blooming all over the place, and lush greenery that made the landscape look like something out of a fairy tale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They took a deep breath, and it felt like their pores were wide open, as if the world's rich energy was pouring into their bodies, slowly boosting their cultivation levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This intense feeling left Isa, Clarissa, Anastasia, and </span><span>the </span><span>others completely speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd thought Hope Haven was amazing, but now, in comparison, it seemed pretty mediocre.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's absolutely gorgeous!" they murmured to each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was also blown away by the beauty of the Mystic Sirius Sect, but his eyes were mostly drawn to the buildings on top of the mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could see people moving around near those structures. "Maddox, tell me about this place," Osborne asked, his curiosity getting the better of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox explained, "Osborne, the Mystic Sirius Sect is a Second-rate Power in the Glorious Divine Kingdom. It's one of the three Second-rate Powers in Tempest Fortress City. The current sect master is Lenny Wilkens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In Tempest Fortress City, Mr. Wilkens is a real heavyweight. But he hardly ever gets involved in the day-to-day running of the sect. Most of the management work is handled by Vice Master Ronald Bennett and the Peak Lords.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Under the Peak Lords, there are the Elders. My teacher, Earvin, is an Elder of the Wolf Peak Seven. And you'll be part of the Peak Seven too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Peak Lord of Peak Seven is Angela Olsen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mystic Sirius Sect is divided into nine peaks, each with its own strength, but all are quite powerful. Even the weakest, Peak Nine, boasts over a hundred thousand outer disciples, ten thousand inner disciples, and hundreds of core disciples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To become an outer disciple, you only need to reach Deity Overlord Level. For inner disciples, you must attain Supernal Deity King status. And to become a core disciple, you either need to reach Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King Level, or perform exceptionally well in the sect's grand tournament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The grand tournament is coming up soon! If you're willing, Osborne, you could participate and likely become a core disciple. The rewards are quite generous, and there's even a chance to represent </span><span>the </span><span>Mystic Sirius Sect in higher-level competitions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can bring glory to </span><span>the </span><span>Mystic Sirius Sect, both the Peak Lords and the sect master will be more than generous with their rewards."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox's rapid-fire introduction gave Osborne a clearer picture of the Mystic Sirius Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued, gesturing toward the majestic mountains, "These are the nine main peaks of the Mystic Sirius Sect! This is Peak Nine. The Peak Lord of Peak Nine is... And the most powerful disciple is... This is Peak Eight. The Peak Lord of Peak Eight is... And the most powerful disciple is..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to Maddox's introduction, Osborne finally got a general idea of the Mystic Sirius Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for more details, he'd have to find out gradually later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, here we are at Peak Seven! From now on, just like me, you'll all be inner disciples of Peak Seven. Now, let me take you to get your identity tokens!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Maddox led Osborne and the others up the magnificent Peak Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Along the way, many disciples of Peak Seven they met immediately looked serious when they saw Maddox. They quickly bowed to Maddox and addressed him respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Maddox ranked seventh among the inner disciples of Peak Seven, so he held a fairly high position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the group stepped into a grand hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hall was a beehive of activity, filled with the sounds of chatter and the energy of bustling disciples. As soon as they entered, a sea of eyes turned in their direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among those gazes, there were some that were cold and full of hostility, like sharp daggers aimed their way.</span></p><div class="pagination">
