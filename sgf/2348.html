  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The unconscious Agatha suddenly felt a terrifying chill and killing intent. Her body was immediately stimulated. Soon, she woke up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She opened her eyes and saw a man wearing a black mask in front of her. Bard Helon stared at her coldly, his eyes full of mockery and ridicule.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Agatha froze, thinking, "I've been found."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha bit her lip, showing no fear or dread, and slowly stood up from the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence, staring directly into Bard's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Who are you? Why do you have to kill me? Did the Ember Phoenix Clan offend you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha thought, even if she died, she at least wanted to know why these people targeted the Ember Phoenix Clan so much.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Bard did not answer her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He merely gave a faint smile and muttered to himself, "Foolish Ember Phoenix Clan, why did they bother? Sending you to deep space was just to let you live a little longer. For that, they even chose self-destruction, causing all the masters of the Ember Phoenix Clan on the Racial Convergence Planet to perish."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They're truly a bunch of foolish people."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do they really think that the growth of the Dark Phoenix can change the fate of the Ember Phoenix Clan? That's impossible. Even if the ancient Dark Phoenix reappears, the Ember Phoenix Clan can never return to its peak, nor break free from the shackles of fate."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, I can't leave the Ember Phoenix Clan with even a sliver of possibility. So, you must die. Now, just die in peace."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Bard reached out. Immediately, a terrifying suction force emerged, and Agatha was lifted into the air, her neck gripped by Bard's hand. Agatha struggled desperately, but it was all in vain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The gap in cultivation level and strength between them was truly terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though Agatha could sense that Bard was injured, he could still kill her effortlessly. There was no suspense about it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dark Phoenix, do you have any last words?" Bard asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha's neck was gripped, and she felt suffocated. Her cheeks turned red as she glared at Bard with anger and hatred.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She struggled and said, "Tell me who you are. If I don't die this time, I will kill all of you in the future to avenge the fallen members of the Ember Phoenix Clan."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing her words, Bard said disdainfully, "It seems you have no last words left. In that case, just die in peace. If you die quickly enough, you might even meet the members of the Ember Phoenix Clan on the Racial Convergence Planet."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Bard prepared to kill Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To him, killing Agatha was no different from crushing an ant, even though Agatha was the Dark Phoenix.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Agatha clearly felt the breath of death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was unwilling, but it was completely useless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that moment, a strange change occurred. Just as Bard struck, his expression suddenly changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the next instant, a purple light suddenly burst forth, carrying terrifying power as it shot toward Bard's heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Bard were still at his peak, he wouldn't care much about such an attack and could easily fend it off.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, at this moment, he had already been injured by the self-detonation of the Ember Phoenix Clan members. Facing such an attack, he dared not be careless and fully unleashed Sacred Power to defend.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, the purple light struck his body, instantly sending him flying, with blood dripping from the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who are you?" Bard roared furiously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, he saw a dilapidated palace appear at incredible speed. A flash of light passed, and Agatha in his hand vanished instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?" Bard exclaimed, then angrily glared at the dilapidated palace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He continued, "Is this a supreme Sacred Sanctum? Who are you? You'd better not meddle. Otherwise, the consequences won't be something you can bear."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, his terrifying power locked onto the Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This dilapidated Sacred Sanctum was naturally the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, and the previous purple light was also emitted by the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, inside the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, Osborne ignored the stunned Agatha and quickly replenished the energy core of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum with Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The purple light just now was powerful, but it consumed a lot of energy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that instant, 100,000 Sacred Crystals in the energy core burned out completely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "Fortunately, although 99% of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum's attack runes are damaged, the remaining ones are the most critical. An all-out attack fueled by burning 100,000 Sacred Crystals would still require even a top-tier warrior at Empyrean Sacredness to handle cautiously."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to save Agatha's body and would have had to replicate Agatha's life essence before leaving."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne replenished 300,000 Sacred Crystals in the energy core.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Osborne very upset.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, during the city duel, he won a total of 1.3 million Sacred Crystals at the casino. Otherwise, he wouldn't even be able to power the Ascending Sacred Sanctum for a full-force attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ascending Sacred Sanctum, let's get out of here quickly," Osborne ordered the Ascending Sacred Sanctum swiftly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "The assassins hunting Agatha are definitely not limited to just this one warrior. Although this warrior is strong, he alone isn't enough to force all the warriors of the Ember Phoenix Clan on the Racial Convergence Planet to self-destruct."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Osborne didn't plan to stay here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since he had already saved Agatha, the next thing he needed to do was to run for his life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he stayed here any longer, he would be surrounded by a group of top-tier warriors. In that case, even with the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, he would surely die and have no chance of escaping.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, "Let's go."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, the propulsion runes of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum shimmered. A large number of Sacred Crystals burned, replenishing the power of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, then transformed into a purple light, swiftly flying into the distance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it!" Bard not only received no response but also saw the Ascending Sacred Sanctum fleeing at an incredible speed. Instantly enraged, his eyes filled with killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He roared, "I don't care who you are or which faction you belong to. If you dare to save Dark Phoenix, you're dead. You won't escape."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Bard also turned into a beam of light, chasing after the Ascending Sacred Sanctum at incredible speed. However, due to his injuries, his speed was slightly slower than that of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation made Osborne inside the Ascending Sacred Sanctum breathe a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He can't catch us." Osborne smiled, then looked at Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Agatha's face was full of shock and disbelief. She stared intently at Osborne, her expression dazed, thinking she was hallucinating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had thought she was doomed earlier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Bard grabbed her by the neck, she could clearly feel Bard's terrifying strength and killing intent. With just a slight move, Bard could have completely wiped her out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that moment, someone attacked Bard, then drove him back and saved her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's just that Agatha never dreamed it would be Osborne who saved her.</span></p><div class="pagination">
