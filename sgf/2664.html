  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head and didn't think much about it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they were really teleported to the central area of the Ancient Battlefield, then it's just their bad luck.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he doesn't need to worry too much about them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had already used the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to replicate their life essence. Even if they really died inside the Skyfall Casket, as long as Osborne remains alive, he can resurrect them after leaving the Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, in that case, they would miss out on the opportunities and treasures within the Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Eighth Skyfall Casket seals an Ancient Battlefield. As long as they kill the astral projections that cyclically appear on the Ancient Battlefield, they can quickly enhance their cultivation level and strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they miss such an opportunity, it would be a real pity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "I hope they can all survive and gain something."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne continued the slaughter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The area he was in now was not the edge of the Ancient Battlefield, nor the center, and the surrounding astral projections were not strong enough to kill him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he was very safe here unless the environment of the Ancient Battlefield changed again, or the surrounding astral projections became stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "From the time I entered the Ancient Battlefield to when the environment changed, it was a total of four days. If I include the day I did nothing, that makes five days. Does the environment change every five days?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wasn't sure, so he planned to wait five days to observe the situation. During these five days, he aimed to kill as many astral projections as possible and reach Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, three days passed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had killed all the easily defeated astral projections around him. At this point, he was close to reaching Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Osborne's expression turned serious because he sensed an unusual energy fluctuation. Immediately, he activated Satan's Eye and looked over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne's eyes filled with excitement because he saw a living person.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had been in the Eighth Skyfall Casket for seven days, but he had been slaughtering and improving his strength in this Ancient Battlefield the entire time, never encountering anyone else.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, he speculated that this Ancient Battlefield was incredibly vast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, more than two hundred people had entered the Eighth Skyfall Casket, yet he had traversed such a vast area of the Ancient Battlefield without encountering a single person.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, everyone must be separated by a great distance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Osborne finally encountered the first living person, and it was someone he knew.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To be more precise, that person was his enemy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment he saw that person, Osborne's gaze turned icy cold, with intense anger and killing intent appearing on his face. At this moment, he even lost interest in the astral projections around him that could enhance his strength, and his eyes were fixed solely on that person in the distance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And that person was Hendrix!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Hendrix was 180 thousand miles away from Osborne, also exerting all his strength to kill astral projections. However, his killing speed was much slower than Osborne's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Hendrix was at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, nearing Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, a higher cultivation level than Osborne's current state, the astral projections around him had all reached Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness. With Hendrix's strength, he couldn't handle them at all and could even find himself in danger if he wasn't careful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could only do as Osborne did, waiting until those astral projections were severely injured and on the brink of death by others before suddenly delivering the final blow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But even so, it was still difficult for him to directly kill those astral projections.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, his attack power was far inferior to Osborne's Sacred Power Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, he could kill them slowly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Hendrix had just killed an astral projection. Feeling the surge of power within his body, his face was filled with a look of ecstasy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix was extremely excited, thinking, "Almost! I only need to kill at most two more astral projections, or maybe just one more, to break through Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection and reach Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, my cultivation level will be the same as Quinn and Naomi's. Then, my cultivation level will be second only to Weston's, and I will become the fourth among all princes and princesses to reach Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix was extremely excited, his face flushed, thinking, "Skyfall Casket truly is a treasure-filled place. At this rate, I might break through my cultivation level to reach Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, or even Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness. By then, I won't even fear facing my father."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes were filled with ruthlessness. He thought, "Father is too cruel, killing Seraphina. I must avenge her. If I can reach Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, I will find a way to kill him first. Otherwise, I will eventually be killed by him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Hendrix prepared to continue slaughtering astral projections.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He continued searching for a target. As long as he killed one more astral projection, he would have a great chance to reach Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness. He could hardly wait.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, he suddenly became excited because he had found his target.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over 621 miles away, he saw two astral projections fiercely battling. One astral projection severely injured the other and quickly killed it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll choose you. Next time you appear, I'll kill you when you're severely injured. By then, I will reach Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness." Thinking this, Hendrix cautiously made his way over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The battle ripples from other fights around were still dangerous for him now, so he had to be cautious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that moment, Hendrix suddenly sensed a dangerous feeling behind him. An intense aura of hatred and killing intent suddenly enveloped him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instantly, Hendrix became serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly turned around, looking toward the source of the killing intent. Then, he froze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the next second, his eyes filled with excitement and thrill. "It's you! You bastard actually dared to show up in front of me? My luck is amazing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The person behind Hendrix was naturally Osborne, who had just arrived.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Hendrix was incredibly excited and said eagerly, "It seems my luck is indeed great. As long as I kill you, I can get the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket from you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In that case, when the Spirit-Entombing Fragrance in Necropolis City becomes thin again after a thousand years, I can re-enter Necropolis City, enter the Eighth Skyfall Casket again, and continue to enhance my strength."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Osborne couldn't help but raise an eyebrow, thinking, "Could the Eighth Skyfall Casket be reopened? Can I use the key to unlock it again after a thousand years?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, that's not important. After all, a thousand years is too long.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stared at Hendrix and said coldly, "You want to kill me? Perfect, I want to kill you too. Let's settle this here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix was stunned, looking at Osborne with some shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then he burst into laughter, as if he'd heard the funniest joke, and said, "You want to kill me and settle things with me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix's face was full of mockery and sarcasm. "What kind of grudge between us needs to be settled? But with my strength, if I wanted to kill you, it would be as easy as squashing a bug. You want to kill me? Too bad, even if I stand here and don't resist, you still can't kill me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Hendrix's face was filled with an arrogant expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his eyes, Osborne's strength and cultivation level were on the same level as Seraphina's, but there was a huge gap compared to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix thought, "How could Osborne possibly kill me?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
