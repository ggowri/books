  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Looks like we need to find those parasitized by the Soulbane Parasites as soon as possible! We must control all the escaped Soulbane Parasites quickly. Otherwise, if even a few escape, it&rsquo;ll be a huge problem.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In this edge of the universe, no one can handle the Soulbane Parasites!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne asked again, "Drum, do you have a way to sense the locations of other Soulbane Parasites and capture them all? Didn't you just say you wanted a few more Soulbane Parasites to cultivate a bug clan?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, Drum shook his head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can't sense them! If I reach maturity, maybe I can do it! Or if my mother wakes up and regains some strength, she could do it too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But right now, I'm just in my juvenile stage. I can't do it yet!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit regretful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Drum, remember to work harder and reach maturity sooner!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For Drum to get through the juvenile stage, he needs to absorb power from Osborne's body. The more he absorbs, the faster he can mature.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, the stronger Osborne is, the faster Drum can get through the juvenile stage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum nodded firmly. "I'll work hard! Besides, even after I get through the juvenile stage, I'll only enter the growth stage. It'll take a long time to reach maturity."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum looked very serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Alright! No rush! Anyway, these Soulbane Parasites shouldn't cause too much trouble in the short term!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After he finished speaking, Drum yawned again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was sleepy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne told Drum to go rest. Drum nodded and returned to the Dimensional Microcosm with the Soulbane Parasite.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial went back too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the Ice Crystal Hall, only Osborne, Adriana, and May were left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After sincerely thanking Osborne for saving her life, May went off to get busy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, there were many things Osborne needed to do.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fairy Moon Sect was an enormous sect. Relocating wasn&rsquo;t a simple task. It wasn&rsquo;t just about taking everyone and leaving.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If that were the case, the loss would be too great.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, many of Fairy Moon Sect's elders had not returned yet. Fairy Moon Sect needed to leave Glorious Divine Kingdom to avoid Frederick's revenge. If they weren&rsquo;t brought along, they would be doomed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Adriana, you should go cultivate too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With those hundred emperor fruits, you just need to absorb them, and you might break through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness! By then, you won&rsquo;t have to fear Emperor Frederick&rsquo;s revenge."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll first go find Isa and Clarissa to clarify our relationship, then I'll go into seclusion!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Adriana left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stayed in the Ice Crystal Hall. Others could use emperor fruits to quickly boost their strength, but he couldn't. His soul power was too strong, and the side effects of the emperor fruit directly affected the Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The stronger the soul power, the more intense the side effects.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could only slowly consume the emperor fruit. If the pace was too fast, the Soul Current Ocean might collapse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This left Osborne a bit helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he could also freely consume emperor fruits to boost his strength and cultivation level, he was confident he could quickly break through to become a Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, he would no longer fear Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll build a Cosmic Translocator first. If Emperor Frederick brings people to attack the Fairy Moon Sect, we'll have another escape route! If we can't beat them, we can still run!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne also got busy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, a loud explosion echoed. The entire ground shook violently. The walls of Ice Crystal Hall had several cracks at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression changed, and he quickly opened his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His body flickered, and he appeared outside Ice Crystal Hall. Standing mid-air, he looked at the violently flickering Protective Barrier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Outside the Protective Barrier, a group of incredibly powerful beings had surrounded Fairy Moon Sect. At the center, a majestic figure wielding an extraordinarily ornate Imperial Artifact Sword slashed down once more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The terrifying sword energy struck the Protective Barrier. Instantly, the Protective Barrier fluctuated violently, emitting colorful lights. The entire Ice Crystal Hall shook intensely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Adriana, May, and Brittany appeared in mid-air, standing beside Osborne. They looked at the numerous warriors outside the Protective Barrier with extremely grave expressions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They've finally come!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It hasn't even been a day. They're so fast!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana bit her lip.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, outside the Fairy Moon Sect, the one fiercely attacking the Protective Barrier was Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Beside him were Callista, Weston, Quinn, and others. In addition, there were leaders from various factions, totaling nearly fifty warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were all Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, these people had all gained benefits from the Skyfall Casket. Many of them had advanced from Common Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness to Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The ones who gained the most were Callista and Weston.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Both of them were now Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh! At this moment, Isa, Clarissa, and others also appeared. Seeing the situation outside the Fairy Moon Sect, their expressions changed, filled with immense worry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The terrifying sword energy struck the Protective Barrier again. The Protective Barrier immediately emitted a strained sound, as if it could shatter at any moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana saw this and immediately let out a cold snort.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She quickly unleashed her power, channeling it into the Protective Barrier, stabilizing it once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Frederick let out a cold snort.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Alba, I told you, you can't escape! You ruined my plans, so I will kill you! Everyone in the Fairy Moon Sect will die with you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick's eyes were filled with killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana gritted her teeth and retorted, "Emperor Frederick, you're too arrogant! Who do you think you are? Want to kill me and destroy the Fairy Moon Sect? You can't do it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick sneered, "Oh really? Then let's try! I want to see just how strong the Fairy Moon Sect's Protective Barrier is and how long it can last!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, attack together!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;Break the protective barrier. Kill everyone except Ms. Alba! As for her&mdash;I want to have her before she dies!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana was instantly furious upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Emperor Frederick, you deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, an even more terrifying attack erupted. Nearly fifty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors, including Frederick, were frantically attacking, aiming to break the Protective Barrier and destroy the Fairy Moon Sect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among them, there were three Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were more than ten Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick possessed the Imperial Artifact Armor and Imperial Artifact Sword, making his power incredibly terrifying. Under such an attack, the immensely strong Protective Barrier of the Fairy Moon Sect couldn't withstand it and began to crack rapidly, seemingly on the verge of shattering.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Not good!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana's face changed drastically. "Everyone, listen up! Channel your power into the Protective Barrier. We must not let it break!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, nearly 100,000 members of the Fairy Moon Sect took action. Regardless of their cultivation level, they all exerted their full strength to channel power into the Protective Barrier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne did the same at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But even so, they could still see the Protective Barrier slowly collapsing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We can't hold it!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
