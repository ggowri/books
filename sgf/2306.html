  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of a sudden, a woman's voice pierced through the silence. "Clara, you good?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara swiftly wiped the blood off the corner of her mouth and scanned the area warily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a figure stepped into view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leroy? Is that you? Come for my tokens, too? Tough luck! Someone else already snatched them. I'm flat-broke. No tokens, no points. There's nothing on me for you to grab," Clara said coolly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy shook her head. "You got the wrong idea. I couldn't care less about those points. I don't get a snowball's chance in hell of making it into the top ten. What's a few more or less gonna change? Fact is, I haven't even bothered looking for tokens for the past three days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara's eyes widened in surprise. "I thought the eight academies joined forces, right? Heard each academy sent their A-team to go for a top-ten finish. You're from Azure Haven Academy, aren't you? You haven't been token-hunting for three days? Didn't your captain throw a fit about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy gave a faint smile. "Yeah, he was ticked off. That's why I bailed on the team on day one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? So what've you been up to these past three days?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been looking for Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy's words left Clara gobsmacked. "You're looking for Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy nodded. "Osborne saved my life during the city duel. If it weren't for him, I'd probably be toast! So when folks started saying Osborne kicked the bucket in the sixth layer, I just couldn't buy it. I hightailed it to the sixth layer to look for him... but I've been scouring the place for three days and come up empty-handed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy sounded really bummed as she added, "Even now, I still can't believe Osborne is gone. As long as I haven't found his body, I'll keep at it until... the state duel wraps up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara gaped at Leroy in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She used to have a downer on Leroy for no good reason, but after hearing what she had to say, her opinion of Leroy did a complete 180.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy had gone against Azure Haven Academy's orders, ditched the state duel, and risked the academy's wrath just to find Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All thanks to the fact that Osborne had lent her a hand once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least Leroy knew how to show gratitude. Clara just couldn't bring herself to loathe someone like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lip and said, "I keep trying to get in touch with Osborne every now and then, but I haven't been able to reach him yet! And I'm not tough enough to head to the sixth layer on my own. Otherwise, I'd have gone looking for him too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy nodded. "The sixth layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm is a real hellhole. I've been there. You can't use the terminal in the sixth layer. The fact that you still can't reach Osborne means he's probably still stuck there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still, I've asked around in the sixth layer, even the referees, and they all said they haven't laid eyes on Osborne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy knitted her brows as she continued, "Logically speaking, even if Osborne kicked the bucket in the sixth layer, there should've been some signs of him. Other folks exploring the place would've bumped into him, the referees would've spotted him... but there's zip."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So?" Clara was all fired up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I reckon Osborne didn't croak in the sixth layer! If he did, it probably wasn't a natural death. Somebody might've got rid of the body to cover their tracks!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy's expression turned grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara's heart skipped a beat, and a look of horror washed over her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you saying... Osborne was murdered?" she asked, biting her lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy nodded grimly. "That's what I suspect. And that's why I've been tailing Conrad's team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I mean, sure, others might've gone after Osborne for the tokens, but Conrad's my prime suspect! He had the motive and the muscle to pull it off. So, I've been trying to keep tabs on them, hoping they'd slip up and give something away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Which is how I stumbled upon you here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wish I was strong enough to lend a hand, but Conrad is a real powerhouse, and his four teammates? All ranked in the top hundred. I could maybe take down one of them, tops.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So I decided to stay put and avoid getting pummeled."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a hint of apology on Leroy's pretty face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara shook her head, dismissing Leroy's concern. "It's not your fault. Those tokens don't mean squat to me. What I really want to know is if you found anything concrete while following Conrad? Did they really ice Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she said this, Clara's eyes blazed with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Leroy shook her head. "From what I've seen? They're clean. If they had something to do with Osborne's disappearance, they deserve an Oscar for best acting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara couldn't hide her disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then who the hell killed Osborne?" Clara asked, frustrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy shrugged. "Beats me! Anyone on the sixth layer has what it takes to take Osborne out and cover their tracks. Or maybe Osborne isn't even dead and is just laying low somewhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyhow, I'm gonna keep looking for the next three days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The state duel isn't over, and I won't quit. Wanna tag along?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara hesitated for a moment, then nodded. "Sure, why not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Clara and Leroy were busy speculating, suspecting, and scouring the place for Osborne, Osborne was steadily making his way towards the summit of the snow-capped mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sweet! Sixteenth Frost-kissed Heart!" Osborne grinned as he stashed the newly discovered prize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mine!" Primordial's voice boomed in Osborne's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes. "Alright, alright! We'll split it three-seven. You get three, I get seven."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial retorted, "Nah, six-four. Without me teaching you how to handle the Frost-kissed Heart, you'd be toast if you even found one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You couldn't even carry it, let alone use it. One wrong move, and you'd kick the bucket right there. So, six-four it is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, you're being a real pig!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, "If I hadn't dragged my ass all the way to the seventh layer, what good would your knowledge of the Frost-kissed Heart be? Just useless trivia rattling around in your skull. And without my Satan's Eye, we wouldn't have found half as many. So, me getting seven and you getting three is fair as sunshine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued, "Most importantly, there are two of us on my side! The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity deserves a cut too. You're a spiritual plant of the world, and so is it! So, I take two shares, 70%. You take one share, 30%. That's as fair as it gets!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial was exasperated. "Fair my ass! The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity is practically glued to you! You're one and the same. You can't use it as an excuse to rip me off. You're being a total scumbag!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, maybe I am. What're you gonna do about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're a real low-life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne bickered with Primordial while continuing to use his Satan's Eye to search for more Frost-kissed Hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, they were within spitting distance of the mountain's peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The icy chill at the peak was even more bone-chilling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I've got a feeling! There's gotta be a motherlode of Frost-kissed Hearts at the top of this mountain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could hardly contain his excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, he reached the summit. When he finally saw what was there, he stood there, utterly gobsmacked.</span></p><div class="pagination">
