  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne realized he had completed his breakthrough, officially becoming a mid-stage Deity King warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body now radiated a brilliant, crystalline glow, each cell shimmering like a precious gem, brimming with immense power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Divine Body has undergone a transformation? No way! Even if it has transformed, it shouldn't be this strong! What level am I at now? Level Ten? Level Eleven? Level Twelve?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was bewildered; everything had taken him by surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was supposed to be a routine Deity King Tribulation had turned into a terrifying ordeal, killing him over a hundred times. The appearance of the sword-wielding Shadow Terror Fiend had dealt him a fatal blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, even the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity had been unable to restore him, leaving him certain of his demise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet somehow, Osborne had woken up again, only to discover that his breakthrough had been completed and his Divine Body was now completely different from before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't pinpoint the exact level of his Divine Body, but he could feel its overwhelming strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His power, defense, and recovery abilities had all reached terrifying heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever the case, I've finally broken through! The Shadow Terror Fiend didn't kill me; it made me even stronger! If I had gone through a normal breakthrough, I doubt I would have gained so much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt exhilarated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The changes in his Divine Body were just part of the transformation. He quickly assessed his overall enhancements, and a smile spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lightning elemental essence had surged from the peak of Level Six to the pinnacle of Level Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His space and dark elemental essences had also broken through to Level Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, his Soul Current Ocean had expanded to over ten times its previous size, amplifying his already formidable spiritual power. Anyone foolish enough to launch a soul attack against him would likely find themselves questioning their own sanity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, Osborne noticed that his connection with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity had grown even tighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could now easily tap into a portion of its energy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? During my unconsciousness, I must have unknowingly completed the seventh and eighth levels of fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he achieved a full ten levels of fusion, he would gain complete control over the Lotus, integrating it into his being as a true Cosmic Treasure, unleashing its full potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, Osborne had already reached the eighth level of fusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tenth level was within reach!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "This is an incredible gain! My strength has been completely reborn! If I faced Aldrich, a mid-stage Deity King, I could take him down with ease!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even against late-stage Deity Kings, I could hold my own if I went all out! Unless they possess peak Deity King strength, defeating me would be nearly impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once my elemental essences reach Level Eight, I won't fear even the strongest Deity Kings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confidence surged through Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder how much time I spent on this breakthrough? I should head back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his emotions in check, Osborne exited the Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon returning to Hope Haven, he saw several figures rush toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Anastasia, Zoe, Bryce, Kendra, Mila, Diana, and Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you're finally back!" Anastasia exclaimed, her face lighting up with joy, though her gaze held a hint of something unusual as she looked at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, why do I feel like you're a bit different? You seem... well, more imposing!" Anastasia remarked, tilting her head slightly as she studied him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Maybe it's just the fact that I've broken through to Deity King."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, his gaze swept over the group, and he noticed something that made his eyes light up. "Anastasia, did you also break through to Deity King?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A proud grin spread across Anastasia's face. "Absolutely! I've made the leap to Deity King!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce chimed in with excitement, "You wouldn't believe the power of Anastasia's Deity King Tribulation! It shrouded the entire Hope Haven!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The thunder that rained down was terrifying&mdash;it had all of us on edge. I don't think I could have withstood it even at Deity King level! Thankfully, Anastasia absorbed all the lightning; otherwise, Hope Haven would have faced destruction, and we'd all be in grave danger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When she finally emerged from the trial, her Divine Body had transformed and reached Level Nine! That's legendary; only Lord Malevolence and the God of Night are said to possess a Level Nine Cosmic Divine Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, none of us are a match for her. Honestly, I feel like her strength is almost on par with yours!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned to Anastasia; astonishment etched across his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face glowed with a mix of pride and delight at the praise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, a chuckle escaping his lips, "Wow, that's impressive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's fantastic that everyone has made such strides and achieved Deity King status!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now we can turn our attention to facing those various clan warriors!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
