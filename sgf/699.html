  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca coldly gave the order. The ten Class AAA Evolved Humans immediately moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They instantly surrounded Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three </span><span>Taurens</span><span>, three Werewolves, two Medusas, and two Titans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All ten had cold killing intent in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! Osborne, you killed many of our brothers and sisters. Now, you must atone! We will break all your bones and crush your flesh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can die now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, the two Medusa attacked first. Cold light burst from their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ghost Petrification!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted coldly. Martial art aura burst forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten Class AAA Evolved Humans had surrounded him for the kill. Osborne had no choice but to fight desperately! Even then, surviving seemed uncertain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had no way out. He could only fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He activated his martial art aura. Though he couldn't completely block Medusa's Ghost Petrification, it minimized its effect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Layers of stone quickly formed on his body, but it didn't hinder his movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the three Tauren also moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bull Rush!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bull Rush!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bull Rush!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three Tauren attacked Osborne simultaneously from three directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were just one Tauren, Osborne could easily handle it. The Tauren's strongest defense was its tough hide. Even if Osborne used Point Blank Force, he couldn't break through it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne's Deadly Force could easily transmit power through their tough hide and severely damage their internal organs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With one punch, he could take down a Tauren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, three Tauren attacked simultaneously. And three Werewolves pounced, claws slashing at Osborne. He couldn't fight back at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he could do was dodge and defend!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang! Bang! Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, the enemies were too many. Osborne wasn't slow, but he couldn't dodge everything. A Werewolf broke through his defense, leaving savage claw marks on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, a Tauren rammed into him, sending him flying. His face turned pale, and blood trickled from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Osborne could catch his breath, two Titans charged, swinging massive fists in a frenzied assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang! Bang! Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom! Boom! Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the battle reached a fever pitch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was immediately at a severe disadvantage. He was like a target. Facing the relentless attacks from ten Class AAA Evolved Humans, he could only desperately dodge and defend, unable to counterattack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were too strong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The combined force of ten Class AAA Evolved Humans was something Osborne couldn't withstand. If not for his strong martial art aura and his powerful body, he wouldn't have survived even one round of attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, he was already coughing up blood. His body had sustained severe injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This won't do!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought while dodging, gritting his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are too many of them, and they're working together too well. If I can't reduce their numbers, I won't last much longer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, there was still Luca, watching from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sensed an even greater threat from Luca.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he was in dire straits, Osborne dared not call Clarissa and Emma for help. He had to save his trump cards for Luca.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was sent flying again by Tauren. He felt intense pain in his chest as if his ribs had fractured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He </span><span>gasped,</span><span> his expression grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, is this all you've got? I'm really disappointed! Looks like I overestimated you. I don't even need to do anything. You're done for."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca's mocking voice reached Osborne's ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need to rush. After I take out these clones, I'll come for you next!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Osborne dodged the Titan's attack again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, deep claw marks appeared on his chest. Werewolf had struck him, leaving wounds so deep the bone was visible, and blood poured out rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face looked even grimmer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like I'll have to go all out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted coldly and didn't hesitate any longer. He immediately transformed into a Vampire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Osborne completed his Vampire transformation. His long, </span><span>blood-red hair appeared even more otherworldly, swaying in the wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His teeth and nails became sharper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His pale, chiseled face became even more handsome, like a statue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt his body surging with power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, his Vampire transformation increased his strength, speed, and defense by more than double. Osborne felt stronger than ever before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shouted fiercely and charged toward one of the Tauren.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring the other attacks, he focused on Tauren's head and delivered a powerful punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deadly Force!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
