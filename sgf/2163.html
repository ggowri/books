  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne grabbed hold of Primordial, who promptly rolled his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go of me! When have I ever lied to you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity is already fully integrated with you. The extent of its incredible powers depends entirely on your cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The stronger you become, the more you can unleash its abilities! Sure, you can't bring back Princess Alfreda right now because of your current strength, but once you're powerful enough, you'll be able to revive her using her life essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, you need to act fast! You've got a maximum of three years. If you can't revive her within that time, her life essence will start to deteriorate. By then, even if you can bring her back, she might not be the same..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a rush of excitement at the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Alfreda can still be revived!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as I grow strong enough, she can come back! This is amazing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three years? As long as there's hope, I can face anything!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reviving Alfreda in three years?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can totally do that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Primordial! Thank you so much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne pulled Primordial in for a fierce hug, then tossed Primordial aside, his face burning with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now I have another reason to get stronger quickly! I will break through to Ascension Eight, or even Ascension Ten! I have to bring Alfreda back before too much time passes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial rolled his eyes again. "Do you really think breaking through to Ascension Eight or Ten is that easy? Even if you had a mountain of Sacred Crystals, jumping from Ascension Three to the minimum of Ascension Eight in three years is a pipe dream."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a moment to cool off at those words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned and asked, "Primordial, do you have a plan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial shrugged. "What plan could I possibly have? If I had one, I wouldn't still be stuck at Ascension Five; I'd be at least Ascension Eight! But I do have a way to make your breakthrough easier."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's that?" Osborne asked, intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial smiled, "Do you remember the fragments of the World Tree that brought me into existence? I promised you that once my strength increased a bit, I would merge those fragments into your bones. This will enhance your physical body and significantly boost your potential and talent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The higher your talent, the faster your growth! Now, I'm strong enough to help you integrate those World Tree fragments!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, recalling their previous conversations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he looked at Primordial with a hint of skepticism. He thought, "Why is Primordial being so generous? Isn't he looking to gain something from this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial seemed to read his thoughts and chuckled, "Relax! A big part of why I'm doing this is for my own sake! I realized that your ability to revive someone using the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity is a bit overpowered... Soon, I might face another World Tree offshoot attack, and with my current strength, I might not stand a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I need you to get stronger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're in this together now; the stronger you are, the better you can help me deal with those World Tree offshoots and assist me in merging with them to become the World Tree again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, if I happen to bite the dust, and you're strong enough, you could even revive me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So really, helping you grow stronger is beneficial for both of us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, realization dawning on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that's the case, let's get started! I'm only at Ascension Three as a Supernal Deity King right now, and I'm not entirely confident I can handle Lord Malevolence if I just head back to Celestara Planet like this. But if I can keep improving on the way back, I'll feel a lot more secure!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A spark of determination flickered in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial nodded in agreement. "Absolutely! First, set a final destination for the Ascending Sacred Sanctum. It'll automatically take us back to Celestara Planet, and it should only take about three days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That gives you the perfect window to integrate the World Tree fragments into your bones! If luck is on your side, you might even break through to Ascension Four and face your second Deity King Tribulation along the way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression shifted as he recalled the looming challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd almost forgotten that breaking through from Ascension Three to Ascension Four meant facing the second Deity King Tribulation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Memories of his first encounter flooded back&mdash;the Ascension Stairway, the overwhelming power of the Order of the Celestial Way, and their relentless pursuit to eliminate him for being abnormal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mood darkened as he contemplated it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne quickly steeled himself. "So what if it's a Deity King Tribulation? I got through the first one; I can handle the second! The Order of the Celestial Way thinks they can just wipe me out? They'll have to try a lot harder!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With newfound resolve, he turned to Primordial. "Let's do this! I can't wait to merge with the fragments of the World Tree!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne retrieved the World Tree fragment from his storage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a massive piece, stretching over ten thousand miles, which he had compressed using spatial power and stored within himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne released the spatial energy, the fragment expanded back to its original form, radiating a vast and pure energy that enveloped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The purity of this power felt even greater than that of an Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just a heads up, this process might be a bit painful, so brace yourself!" Primordial warned, eyeing the fragment with a hint of reluctance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, this piece of the World Tree was where he had originated, and he held a deep connection to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was of no use to him anymore; it was a treasure for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once merged with Osborne's bones, this fragment would enhance his body tremendously, boosting his talent and potential and possibly even pushing him to a higher cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy already has mind-blowing talent and potential&mdash;better than many from the Sacred Dragon Clan or Sacred Tiger Clan. He's truly a Celestial Progeny! I can't wait to see how incredibly powerful he'll become once the World Tree fragments are integrated into him! Perhaps soon, the entire cosmos will tremble because of him! Maybe he really can help me eliminate the other seven World Tree offshoots and gain their core energy to restore the World Tree's power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those thoughts racing in his mind, Primordial finally took action. "Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a commanding shout, the enormous World Tree fragment lifted into the air, rapidly shrinking in size.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Merge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, Primordial pointed his finger at Osborne, and the now tiny World Tree fragment seamlessly integrated into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahhh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, Osborne's anguished scream echoed through the air.</span></p><div class="pagination">
