  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neville and Cyrus were lost in a frenzy, their minds consumed by madness. Both were Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings, boasting Class B scores in the Astral Testing Arch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their powers were evenly matched, and the intensity of their battle reflected that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their injuries, neither was close to defeat, their blows echoing like thunder in the mushroom forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Beverly, it was clear that even an Ascension Three Supernal Deity King would be risking their life by stepping into the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of Osborne, an Ascension One, approaching the chaos made her heart race with anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, don't be reckless!" she shouted, her voice laced with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda, noticing Osborne's movement, echoed Beverly's concern, her voice rising in alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, stop right there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Beverly! You handle the Ghostwing Insects! I'll deal with Neville and Cyrus! Osborne, stay put! Your cultivation level is too low; let me handle this..." she began, but before she could finish, Neville and Cyrus, sensing Osborne's approach, suddenly halted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They turned their wild, blue eyes toward him, madness flickering within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In unison, they lunged at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh no!" Beverly gasped, her heart pounding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't let Osborne be caught in their wrath. Without a second thought, she dashed forward, desperate to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne was faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neville and Cyrus were both Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings, their cultivation levels far surpassing Osborne's. Coupled with their exceptional talents, they were significantly stronger than the average Ascension Five Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under normal circumstances, Osborne wouldn't stand a chance against either of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne didn't panic. His face remained calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a confident smile, he invoked his secret weapon: the absolute forbidden zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his cultivation level wasn't high enough, he'd simply bring theirs down to his level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive, ethereal image of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity erupted behind him, enveloping Neville and Cyrus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, their cultivation levels plummeted from Ascension Five to Ascension Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with their powers significantly diminished, Osborne felt the tide turning in his favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in their madness, Neville and Cyrus continued to attack with reckless abandon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But their strikes, once formidable, now lacked the strength they had before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their blows crashed against Osborne's divine power defenses, creating mere ripples that faded into nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood firm, unyielding, as if the ground beneath him were made of iron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Osborne closed the distance between them, appearing right in front of the two crazed Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With wild eyes, they swung at him, fists flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne didn't flinch; he met their assault head-on with a punch of his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact was deafening. Neville and Cyrus were sent sprawling, their massive bodies crashing into the dark purple ground with a thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They let out a muffled groan and then fell unconscious, their struggles finally at an end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it!" Osborne said, brushing his hands together as if dusting off his palms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly, who had just reached him, stood frozen, her eyes wide in disbelief. She stared at Osborne's back and then at the fallen forms of Neville and Cyrus, still processing what had just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly's face reflected sheer shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "How is it possible? Neville and Cyrus are both Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While she had confidence in her ability to defeat either of them individually, taking on both together was another story entirely. The idea of knocking them out seemed almost impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, right before her eyes, Osborne had taken them down with just one move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he was only an Ascension One Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was unfathomable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow..." She breathed in sharply, her mind racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Alfreda, who had been battling the Ghostwing Insects, stood stunned, staring at Osborne with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was so taken aback that a Ghostwing Insect's attack hit her defenses, and she barely noticed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A series of violent explosions rocked the ground, making her divine power defenses ripple with energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out!" Osborne called Alfreda urgently, snapping her back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a swift motion, he raised his hand, channeling his divine power to lift the unconscious forms of Neville, Arabela, and Cyrus, alongside the injured Avery, Godfrey, and Hermione.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He urged, his voice steady despite the chaos around them, "Let's move! We need to get out of here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know you all have a lot of questions, but we'll sort them out once we're clear of this mushroom forest! These strange mushroom trees are still spreading more spores, and if we stick around, we might find ourselves going mad as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Things could get dangerous pretty quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then positioned himself next to Alfreda. With a flick of his finger, bolts of lightning crackled to life, forming a dense web of electric energy that surged forward, striking precisely at the hidden Ghostwing Insects lurking within the void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of these insects hadn't even made a move to attack yet, their energy signatures still concealed. But it didn't matter; they were caught off guard and had no chance to evade Osborne's Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This power was the nemesis of this particular breed of stealthy insect&mdash;Osborne's ultimate trump card against their kind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each flash of lightning, Ghostwing Insects exploded like overripe fruit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air crackled violently, and in an instant, more than ten thousand Ghostwing Insects were vaporized, their bodies bursting apart under the storm of lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence enveloped the area, as if the forest had hit a pause button.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda and Beverly watched, mouths agape, as the previously menacing swarm exploded into a shower of harmless remnants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this even possible?" they muttered, shaking her head in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ghostwing Insects were notoriously weak when it came to defense, but their greatest strength lay in their ability to conceal themselves. They only emitted gentle ripples of energy when they launched their attacks, just enough to give away their positions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Alfreda, with her advanced skills, could only counterattack when they struck first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For those hidden and waiting patiently in the shadows, she was powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Osborne had just wiped out all of the hidden Ghostwing Insects in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not a single one remained in front of them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beverly and Alfreda exchanged glances, their minds racing with a whirlwind of questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the realization hit both women like a thunderclap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments before, they had thought Osborne's cultivation level was a liability in the perilous environment of Umbra Earth. They believed he needed their protection to survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, everything had shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this life-or-death situation, it was Osborne&mdash;the one with the lowest cultivation level&mdash;who remained the most composed and effective, the one pulling them from the brink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if they were seeing him for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, they pushed aside their shock and confusion, following closely behind Osborne as he guided them through the chaos of the mushroom forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, with every passing moment, the mushrooms around them trembled violently, shaking and releasing more spores into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slowly but surely, the effects of the spores began to creep in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings nearby were starting to succumb, their eyes slowly turning an eerie blue, hinting at the madness about to take hold.</span></p><div class="pagination">
