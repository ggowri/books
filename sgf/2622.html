  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, only sixty people could still stand in front of the massive door of the Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three days ago, there were a total of 109 participants in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other forty-nine had died in the earlier Spirit-Entombing Fragrance attack, including three princes and princesses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were once nine princes and princesses, but now only six remain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone looked dissatisfied, and even the faces of Seraphina and the other six princes and princesses were extremely grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obviously, they also didn&rsquo;t know Necropolis City was this dangerous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, stop wasting time. We'd better hurry into the Celestial Spire. Emperor Frederick mentioned that it's safer inside the Celestial Spire than outside for us," someone said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many immediately agreed, as they were still enduring the Soul Attack. They feared that if they didn&rsquo;t enter the Celestial Spire soon, they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to withstand it and would end up among the dead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're right. Let's hurry inside!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Things are already like this, and saying anything else is useless. We have no way out now. If we don&rsquo;t get the Skyfall Casket key from the Celestial Spire, Emperor Frederick won&rsquo;t let us leave. All of us will die here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, only by quickly entering the Celestial Spire, passing its trials, and obtaining the Skyfall Casket key can we make it out alive!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What this person said was agreed upon by everyone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Seraphina said, "I'm glad everyone has a clear understanding. You're absolutely right. If we don't pass the eighteenth trial of the Celestial Spire and obtain the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket, we won't leave Necropolis City alive."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I&rsquo;m no exception either. We either get the key to the Skyfall Casket, or die in Necropolis City!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, she glanced at everyone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, we need to work well together from now on. Only by combining everyone's strength can we better pass the trials and get the key!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In this situation, we must appoint a leader, someone who can unite us and lead us through the trials."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I think that person should be me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Because I know Celestial Spire best, and I'm the strongest."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, a proud expression appeared on Seraphina's face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, as soon as she finished speaking, Leroy sneered, "What makes you think you can be the leader to guide us? Are you really the strongest? How can you say that? If I remember correctly, you were only fifth place in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There are also three joint champions here!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Leroy looked at Osborne and added, "If you have to choose a leader, I think Osborne is the most suitable because he is the strongest."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After she finished speaking, many people immediately began to agree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's right. Osborne is the champion! Osborne defeated you head-on in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel. What makes you claim you're the strongest?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's right. Osborne is the champion!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina's face darkened upon hearing this. She shouted sternly, "Fool!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She glanced around at everyone and said calmly, "On this Celestial Spire, there is a powerful Cultivation Shackle, and only those who haven't reached Empyrean Sacredness can enter it. Once we enter the Celestial Spire, the Cultivation Shackle will no longer affect us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, we can break through to a new cultivation level!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Once I break through to a new cultivation level, I can immediately reach mid Empyrean Sacredness. In that case, do you think Osborne's strength will surpass mine?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Seraphina looked disdainful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was shocked upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After entering the Celestial Spire, we can break through to a new cultivation level? Once you break through, you can reach mid Empyrean Sacredness? How is that possible? How can you do that?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina arrogantly smiled and said, "The royal family's methods are beyond your imagination. I admit I lost to Osborne in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, I wasn't his match!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But after we enter the Celestial Spire, I will reach mid Empyrean Sacredness, while he can at most break through to primary Empyrean Sacredness. With such a gap in cultivation level, what can he use to compete with me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My strength is the greatest, so of course, I will be the leader!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina finished speaking and looked at Osborne provocatively.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile, too lazy to pay her any attention.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy retorted unwillingly, "So what if you can break through to mid Empyrean Sacredness? Everyone, don't forget she's a royal princess. The royal family hid information from us and didn't inform us in advance about the situation in Necropolis City, which led to such heavy casualties!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you sure you want her to lead us?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm worried she'll get us killed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Leroy finished speaking, everyone's expressions turned serious as they began to think carefully.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Seraphina extremely angry, and she glared fiercely at Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She gritted her teeth and said, "What happened before was just an accident. The royal family didn't deliberately hide anything. The truth is, it was a serious matter, and we couldn't tell you in advance. Besides, the royal family's losses were far greater than yours."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you think my father deliberately wanted to get us killed?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Seraphina finished speaking, everyone nodded, feeling that she made a good point.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Anyway, I won't accept you as the leader!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I only listen to Osborne!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy looked determined.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, stop arguing. The Spirit-Entombing Fragrance outside is getting stronger. We'd better enter the Celestial Spire first. Let's talk after we break through to a new cultivation level!" someone said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina thought for a moment, nodded, and said, "Alright! We should enter the Celestial Spire first. After everyone breaks through to a new cultivation level, we&rsquo;ll decide who will be the leader!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, she took the lead and walked into the Celestial Spire, and the others quickly followed her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and, along with Leroy and Clara, stayed at the back before finally entering the Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The massive door of the Celestial Spire in front of them cast a beam of light, scanning their bodies. Then, the enormous door transformed into a soft water curtain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone walked in effortlessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone felt a slight dizziness. Then, they entered the interior of the Celestial Spire. It was an extremely dim world, surrounded by thick fog, appearing incredibly quiet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, it's safe here!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Seraphina said, "The royal family once sent people to the Celestial Spire, so I&rsquo;m quite familiar with its first few levels."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's temporarily safe here. We can break through to a new cultivation level here. The trials in the Celestial Spire are extremely challenging. We must reach Empyrean Sacredness and work together to have a chance of passing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, let's each break through to a new cultivation level!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Seraphina finished speaking, she sat cross-legged on her own. The power around her began to surge and erupt wildly, and her aura grew stronger and stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She is breaking through to Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other five princes and princesses also sat cross-legged like Seraphina and began breaking through to a new cultivation level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, everyone exchanged glances.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Looks like it's not that dangerous here. Let's quickly break through to a new cultivation level! Only by reaching Empyrean Sacredness can we be safer!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, almost everyone sat cross-legged and began breaking through to a new cultivation level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy and Clara looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and said, "Let's break through to a new cultivation level first! Once we reach Empyrean Sacredness, we'll look at other situations."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy nodded and immediately sat cross-legged.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne also sat cross-legged, excitement flashing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had suppressed his cultivation level for a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, he could finally break through.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was finally about to reach Empyrean Sacredness, and his strength could continue to improve.</span></p><div class="pagination">
