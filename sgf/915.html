  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson's expression was grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the former Godfather had only made you the head of the Augustine family, you wouldn't quite be the new Godfather yet. But since he's entrusted you with the Draco Group as well, you've inherited everything from him. You are the new Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad the former Godfather took the Godfather's scepter with him. If it were here, you could hold the Godfather's coronation right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mouth fell open in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "I've only completed seven trials. According to Grandpa's original plan, I still have three more trials to finish before I can inherit everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But maybe my growth has exceeded his expectations, or perhaps he anticipated something would happen to him and prepared me to take over early."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I really the new Godfather now?" Osborne murmured, suddenly feeling the weight of responsibility settle heavily upon his shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wesson Augustine, can we keep this under wraps for now? I'm not ready for anyone to know&mdash;neither my identity as the head of the Augustine family nor as the owner of the Draco Group," Osborne said, urgency creeping into his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson frowned, studying him closely. "Godfather, are you hesitant to take on this responsibility? Who else can bear it? If you neglect the Augustine family and the Draco Group, they'll crumble before you know it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head vigorously. "Mr. Wesson Augustine, you've misunderstood me. It's not that I don't want to take responsibility or that I don't care about the Augustine family or the Draco Group. I just feel that I'm not strong enough yet. Keeping my identity hidden would be more convenient for me right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, Grandpa is still alive. I want him to be the one to announce this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson hesitated for a moment, then nodded slowly. "Alright! We'll keep it under wraps for now. However, the core elders of the Augustine family and key managers of the Draco Group will need to be informed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When the former Godfather returns, we'll make your identity public."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded in agreement, his gaze drifting to the letter left by Sebastian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's hesitation, he carefully opened the envelope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, he found words from Sebastian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt as if Sebastian's voice echoed in his ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, by the time you read this letter, I may no longer be with the Augustine family. But don't worry; I'm not going to die easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know? You're more capable than your father and even beyond what I imagined. That's why I've decided to entrust the Augustine family to you early and hand over the Draco Group as well. I'm sorry for putting such a heavy burden on you so soon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I believe you can do it. You will be stronger than I ever was, and your future won't just be as Rosmandi's Godfather; you're destined to become the Godfather of the entire world&mdash;a super Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, lead the Augustine family and the Draco Group forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your enemies will be formidable and relentless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I have faith in you! The Aberrants may launch a full-scale assault on the Augustine family and the Draco Group within a month! So here, I'm leaving you with the final eighth trial of your inheritance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Break through to Class S within a month!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes locked onto the last line of the letter, and he took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had technically inherited everything from his grandfather, Sebastian was still setting a new trial for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't see any issue with that. In fact, it only fueled his determination to rise to the challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't pinpoint exactly when Sebastian's tests for his heir became more than mere trials; they had evolved into a relentless push for rapid growth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each challenge grew tougher, and with every hurdle, Osborne's strength surged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's tough, but I'll get it done!" Osborne murmured, carefully tucking the letter away, a fierce determination igniting in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "The Aberrants?! A full-scale assault in a month? I need to level up fast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wesson Augustine, I'll be counting on you for everything from here on out. I need to head back and rest for a bit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson nodded, his expression serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rest assured. Even though my strength isn't the greatest, I've been managing the ins and outs of the Augustine family and the Draco Group. Everything will be under control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've fought over a hundred battles today; you should get some rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded in acknowledgment and left Mount Celestial Reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he could easily stay there now, he found comfort in returning to the First Estate at Mount Seven, the home of the Dampston branch bloodline of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here, it felt more like home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne slipped inside without disturbing anyone, returning to his luxurious residence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally back, huh?" A soft voice broke the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up as he spotted Isa lounging on the sofa, her long legs casually resting on the table, looking relaxed and at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but grin. "Isa, you weren't waiting too long, were you?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
