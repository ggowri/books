  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not a matter of money? Then what's the problem?" Osborne frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kristen, as the head of sales, had big authority and access to large funds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How couldn&rsquo;t she acquire those 'low-quality' rubies with so much money? The problem must be bigger than money itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kristen replied quickly, "Mr. Augustine, it's not that we're not offering enough. The fact is, those Crystals of Life are no longer in their hands!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For five years, the crystals have been bought from them before we even had a chance! We sold about 200,000 Crystals, and the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> sold a 100,000. Out of those 300,000 Crystals of Life, nearly 90% have already been acquired by someone else!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've tried, but it's like chasing shadows. They're not even </span><span>Rosmandian</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mind raced, trying to figure out. "Not </span><span>Rosmandian</span><span>? Then who are they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kristen continued, "I'm not entirely sure. They come from dozens of different countries, but I have a feeling they're linked to the League of Divine Descent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Every nation with a Divine Family here had sent representatives to acquire the Crystals."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne confirmed her guess. "It's the League of Divine Descent behind this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kristen said, her expression grave, "Absolutely. They've managed to gather about 300,000 Crystals of Life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Each Divine Family likely has around 10,000 crystals now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pondered, "League of Divine Descent already has that many crystals, and they still want more? And they are still trying to seize the mines of the Draco Group to control the original production of Crystal of Life?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What are they planning?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They must have known about the value of the Crystals for at least five years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they've kept it under wraps. What are they using them for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The questions swirled in his mind, and he decided to put them aside for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne needed answers, and the best way to get them would be to capture a high-ranking member of the league and extract the information he sought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had 30,000 Crystals of Life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that should be enough for the time being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, these crystals can only replenish vitality and heal wounds; they won't enhance strength or elevate rank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If each member of the Blood Demon gets one, that would be less than 5,000 crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he gave everyone in the Draco Armed Services Branch and all the key figures from the Augustine family who are Class A or above, that's still under 10,000.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would leave him a solid backup of 20,000. That should be enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And as long as they can defeat the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, they'll keep control of the rare metal mines, ensuring a steady supply of crystals in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this reassuring calculation, Osborne turned to Kristen. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Continue buying back any remaining Crystals of Life on the market. Get whatever you can. And set aside 10,000 for me for my use."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"OK!" Kristen took the order and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne then turned to Giovanni. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Giovanni Mirante, start a second round of research on all the metal ores. We need to ensure there&rsquo;s nothing missing. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the recent discoveries of the Divine Bone Crystal and the Crystals of Life, there might be a third valuable material waiting to be found."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely, Mr. Augustine!" Giovanni replied, already diving into his work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The research facilities buzzed with frenetic energy, a hive of activity that represented the core of the Draco Group. It was those institutes that allowed the group to be powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, there were three inevitable things: death, firearms, and the Draco Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The products manufactured by the Draco Group seeped into every aspect of daily life, with most of them coming from those very research facilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> target us here?" Osborne thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those research facilities were very important to the Draco Group's operations; any disruption should be avoided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> shouldn't dare to make a move. This is a bustling </span><span>urban area. If they were to attack us, the damage to innocent civilians would be catastrophic&mdash;and that would surely provoke the </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> government.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>True, the </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> government doesn't interfere often, and they tend to sit on the sidelines when superpowers clash. Even if there were bodies piling up and gore spilling over, they wouldn't involve themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when it comes to civilian casualties, that's a different thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> government holds many nuclear missiles, and even a Class S powerhouse wouldn't stand a chance against that sort of firepower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No superpower wants to mess with a nation that has nuclear weapons."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more he considered it, the more reassured he felt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But even if they don't launch a large-scale assault, we can't rule out the possibility of smaller-scale assassinations. I need to give the place a special security force immediately!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
