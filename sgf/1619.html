  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emmett was momentarily stunned by Osborne's harsh words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the shock wore off, anger surged through him, causing his body to tremble with rage. His face twisted with a fierceness that suggested he wanted nothing more than to devour Osborne alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you, you lowly Human Community piece of trash! I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a furious roar, Emmett lunged at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a peak Celestial Deity, he wasn't holding back; divine power surged around him like a tempest. In his blind fury, he unleashed an attack so powerful that even a standard early-stage Celestial Deity would be left severely injured, if not dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Riley and the others watched with cold expressions, showing no intention of intervening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, they were eager to let Emmett teach Osborne a brutal lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if it ended in death, they could easily fabricate a story about Osborne being killed by a </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one would dare challenge Emmett, and certainly, he wouldn't face any punishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emmett's lethal strike hurtled toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne was ready to reveal some of his power and give Emmett a good thrashing, a figure suddenly appeared right before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Diana!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's intervention shattered Emmett's attack, sending him staggering back three steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell are you doing, Emmett?" Diana </span><span>shouted,</span><span> her tone as fierce as her stance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emmett regained his footing, furious to see that Diana had defeated his strike so effortlessly and pushed him back. His cheeks flushed red with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she was only a late-stage Celestial Deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that she had so easily countered his full-force attack was an insult he simply couldn't bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, even Riley and the others stared at Diana in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had completed missions together before, but Diana had never shown her true abilities in dangerous situations. They hadn't realized she was so powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emmett was a prodigy from the Soaring Lion Clan, his strength significantly surpassing that of the average peak Celestial Deity. The guards in their group wouldn't have stood a chance against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, here Diana was, pushing him back like it was nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their expressions hardened as they exchanged glances, realizing that Diana was not who they thought she was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne was taken aback by her unexpected strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't believe she's such a genius!" Osborne thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emmett's voice dripped with venom as he shot back at Diana. "You worthless bitch! What do you think you're doing? Are you seriously going to help him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana </span><span>frowned,</span><span> her stance unwavering. "Why shouldn't I help him? Osborne is my friend, and you've got no reason to attack him. As long as I'm here, you'll have to go through me first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With fierce determination, she added, "If you want to harm Osborne, you'll have to kill me first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emmett's rage boiled over as he clenched his fists tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think I'm afraid to kill you? You're just a lowly Human Community member! Don't think that just because you have earth elemental power to help the Wild Flame Army extract Essence Crystals, I wouldn't dare! Get out of my way, or I won't hold back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana stood her ground, gazing straight into Emmett's eyes without an ounce of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said, kill me first if you want to hurt Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for it!" Emmett snarled, ready to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that moment, Riley stepped forward, calm and collected. "Mr. Emmett Huntington, hold on just a second! We still need Diana's help to extract Essence Crystals. Killing her won't do us any good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emmett's jaw tightened at Riley's </span><span>words,</span><span> his frustration evident. But he remained silent, the anger simmering just beneath the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Emmett merely glared at Diana and Osborne, gritting his teeth. "If it weren't for your slight usefulness, I'd have killed you, you pathetic human woman! And you, Osborne, just wait. If I don't take you down, I won't be called Emmett!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he stepped back, leaving a thick tension in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled </span><span>faintly,</span><span> his silence more chilling than any words could convey. A glint of cold malice flickered in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Riley interjected, his voice cold as steel, "Keep scouting ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't afford another blunder like that. From now on, I expect you to be more thorough while scouting. Watch your back; no more oversights."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged, brushing off the reprimand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He and Diana turned away and continued deeper into the mine, quickly slipping from view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What was that all about, Mr. Raglan? Why did you stop me? If you had just backed me up, we could've dealt with that punk right then and there!" Emmett fumed, his frustration boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Riley remained calm and composed. "Mr. Emmett Huntington, there's no rush! I'm just as furious about the loss of a guard. That pathetic human needs to die; that much is clear. But killing him off so easily would be too merciful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, it could create problems down the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That Diana... I don't know why, but she's hell-bent on protecting him. We still need her on our side, so we can't go all out against her just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Patience is key here. I assure </span><span>you,</span><span> Osborne will suffer&mdash;his death will be drawn out right in front of us..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of menacing intent shone in Riley's eyes, the promise of vengeance lingering in the air.</span></p><div class="pagination">
