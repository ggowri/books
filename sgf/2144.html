  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isidore's face was a mask of shock and confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! How is this happening? I used the Sublime Concealment Orb to project my soul into the Umbra Earth continent. How could the rules of this place detect me? I never directly touched them; there's no way I should have been discovered!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His anger flared as he turned to the depths of the cave, where a dilapidated Sacred Artifact-level palace, known as the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, lay waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had meticulously planned this moment, using his soul to reach this very location for one reason: the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isidore had gone to great lengths to prepare for this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Umbra Earth continent allowed only those under three hundred years old to enter; anyone else would be obliterated by its rules.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fearing for his true form, he had spent a fortune to acquire a treasure&mdash;the Sublime Concealment Orb!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hid a portion of his soul within the orb, </span><span>and </span><span>concealed inside Uriel's body, allowing him to enter the Umbra Earth undetected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Isidore still hesitated to show himself. It wasn't until Uriel was killed by Osborne that he felt forced to manifest, using the Sublime Concealment Orb to solidify his soul. His intention was clear: eliminate Osborne and Alfreda, then make off with the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Isidore succeeded, no one would ever know he had acquired it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Ascending Sacred Sanctum in his grasp, he was confident he could become the most powerful warrior in this cosmos, the greatest elven warrior in history.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything was progressing smoothly until Osborne and Alfreda proved to be stronger than he anticipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he believed he could handle them without attracting the attention of the Umbra Earth's rules.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as success seemed within reach, disaster struck!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rules of Umbra Earth had discovered him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Isidore felt the continent's wrath bearing down on him. The storm clouds gathering above, crackling with lightning, were the embodiment of that anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Umbra Earth wanted him gone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic surged through Isidore as he unleashed his power, desperately trying to turn and plunge deeper into the cave. "No! I haven't taken the Ascending Sacred Sanctum yet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't be expelled! I can't be erased!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just give me a little more time! Once I have the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, I swear I'll leave willingly!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just a bit more time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isidore was frantic now; killing Osborne was no longer his priority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he wanted was to reach the depths of the cave and claim the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was too late!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Isidore struggled, the storm above him grew even more furious, as if enraged by his defiance. A crushing pressure bore down on him, rendering him immobile, his face contorted in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Damn it all!" Isidore roared in frustration, but it was futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was merely a soul; while he could easily deal with Alfreda and Osborne, he was powerless against the rules of Umbra Earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even his true form could withstand this force!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His unwillingness to accept defeat was meaningless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying bolt of lightning finally struck down, aimed directly at Isidore's soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of that lightning was so overwhelming that Osborne felt his own body tremble, even though he was not the target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With that kind of force, not even an Empyrean Sacredness warrior could withstand </span><span>it," Osborne thought, glancing at Isidore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lightning struck Isidore's soul with pinpoint accuracy. He let out a horrific scream as his essence turned translucent, visibly weakened in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! Damn it! This isn't how it's supposed to end!" Isidore howled in fury, but it was all in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bolts of lightning rained down upon him from above, each one striking like a hammer, scattering his essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If not for the Sublime Concealment Orb, his soul would have already been shattered into nothingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet deep down, Isidore knew he couldn't escape this fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rules of Umbra Earth were relentless&mdash;they would obliterate his soul before he could ever touch the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Isidore turned his gaze to Osborne, grinding his teeth in defiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You lucky human! The Ascending Sacred Sanctum is yours now! But mark my words&mdash;I will find you! When I do, if you hand over the Sanctum willingly, I might spare your life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His icy words hung in the air, and in an instant, Osborne felt a jolt of information surge into his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could process it, a final, horrifying bolt struck, and Isidore's soul could endure no longer&mdash;it shattered explosively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep the Ascending Sacred Sanctum safe for me! I will find you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those last words, Isidore's soul disintegrated into nothingness, leaving behind a gleaming, translucent orb that pulsed softly with light&mdash;the Sublime Concealment Orb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Isidore's presence faded completely, the chaos in the sky gradually calmed, and the storm seemed to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Isidore's soul obliterated, Osborne finally let out a breath he hadn't realized he was holding, collapsing onto the ground in relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was over!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His plan had worked&mdash;Isidore's soul had genuinely been destroyed by the Umbra Earth's lightning!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was still alive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as joy flooded through him, it was overshadowed by a heavy sorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda was gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how much he had replicated her life essence, he couldn't bring her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered fiercely, "Isidore! Just wait!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One day, I'll make you pay for this! Alfreda, I swear I'll avenge you! When I'm stronger, I'll track down Isidore back in Elf City and take him down.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll bring his head back to honor your memory!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne whispered this vow, he forced the anguish deep down, focusing instead on the information Isidore had involuntarily imparted to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression sharpened with surprise as he processed the newfound knowledge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this... the method to activate the Ascending Sacred Sanctum? Why would Isidore </span><span>give me that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furrowing his brow, Osborne started to connect the dots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "I see! Isidore must have been worried I wouldn't be able to get the Sanctum out of here! That's why he shared the activation method with me! This Umbra Earth continent is about to leave deep space and return to Umbra World.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I can't take the Ascending Sacred Sanctum with me, it'll go back to Umbra World, and Isidore will never have a shot at it again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if I manage to get it out, he could still find me and take it back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's why he wanted me to protect it! What a clever plan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chill spread across Osborne's features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if I have something, is he really going to think he can get it back? He's dreaming!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ascending Sacred Sanctum is mine now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isidore, you're going to regret teaching me the activation method! Soon, I'll use that very method to harness the power of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum and return to Elf City, where I'll erase you for good&mdash;and avenge Alfreda!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that icy promise, Osborne strode purposefully toward the cave's depths.</span></p><div class="pagination">
