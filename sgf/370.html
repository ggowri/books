  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac's expression looked extremely ugly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only him, but all the Augustine family members present, whether they were members of </span><span>the </span><span>Wise Order or the younger generation, were extremely angry at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Isaac Augustine, you must not hand over Osborne." At this time, Ryan was the first to stand up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan usually had a gentle temper and never fought for anything, but at this moment, he seemed furious. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne is the heir of the Augustine family and the leader of our young generation. If we hand him over, what will the Augustine family be? How will others view us? We are not a vassal of the Paltrow family. We are all the ancient families. The Paltrow </span><span>family is going too far. We can just fight them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, Queenie also spoke up. "That's right. We </span><span>can&rsquo;t let them have</span><span> Osborne. We will fight them. The Paltrow family wants to bully us. Even if we can't beat them down, we will hurt them as much as we can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kaden did not say anything. He just silently transformed into a giant and stared at Brad, Yohan, and Lauren angrily as if he would attack them at any time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad looked disdainful. "You are a bunch of naive guys. You still think you are very courageous. But you don't know that among superpowers, only strength and interests are the basis. Are you willing to fight for </span><span>honor</span><span>? That's great. Many superpowers and ancient families in history have perished in this way. If you want to choose this path, I will help you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Brad finished speaking, everyone in the Augustine family became even angrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yohan sneered at this time, "Don't waste your time talking to them. Since they are unwilling to hand over Osborne, then we should go to war with the Augustine family. If the Augustine family wants to perish, then we will destroy them. When the time comes, I will kill Osborne with my own hands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad waved his hand upon hearing this. "Yohan, don't be so impulsive. We are not here to challenge the Augustine family. We should give them a chance, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he looked at Isaac again. "Isaac, what is your decision? Hurry up and say something. Don't embarrass the younger generation of the Augustine family. Are you going to hand over Osborne or not?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't think you should blame me for not reminding you. The Augustine family has been passed down for hundreds of years. Don't let it perish in your hands. Do you really think that the Augustine family can fight against the Paltrow family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are already old. Don't say I look down on you. Although you are a Class A Power Master and have been promoted to Class A for more than 40 years, it is not difficult for us to kill you.</span><span>"</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In fact, as long as the Paltrow family's young master, Alexander, stabilizes his realm, he will be able to defeat you. With only this little strength of the Augustine family, what can you use to fight against the Paltrow family? Just accept your fate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Brad finished speaking, everyone in the Augustine family became even angrier. Isaac knew that what Brad said was true. It was difficult to refute Brad. But he wouldn't </span><span>betray </span><span>Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is impossible!" Isaac shouted fiercely, "Brad, fuck off. Although the Augustine family is not as strong as the Paltrow family, there are no cowards in the Augustine family. Osborne is one of us, even if he is not the heir, we will never hand him over to the Paltrow family. So, get out now. If you want to fight, then fight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, a ball of raging fire gushed out from Isaac's body, turning him into a man of fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad's expression changed. He said coldly, "Isaac, have you really thought it through? Do you want to fight the Paltrow family for a young man who may never succeed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac snorted coldly, "Fuck off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, it was Brad who </span><span>got furious</span><span>. He stared at Isaac and felt the boiling flames around Isaac. Brad didn't dare to provoke him in the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad thought, "Although we are both Class A masters, Isaac is a </span><span>metahuman</span><span>, while I am just a martial artist. </span><span>Metahuman</span><span> is naturally half a level stronger than martial artist. If we really have a fight, I will definitely not be a match for Isaac, not to mention that we are in the Augustine Estate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. I will tell the Paltrow family your decision. I hope you won't regret it. I hope everyone in the Augustine family won't regret it." After saying that, Brad waved his hand and was about to leave with his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, Osborne slowly walked into the conference room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was outside the door and listened to the entire conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne </span><span>was touched</span><span>. The reason why he came to the Augustine family to be the heir was actually just because of the Godfather's test.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Osborne had no feelings or sense of belonging to the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that once he completed the test of succession, he would leave the Augustine family without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, Osborne felt a sense of belonging to the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, bowed slightly to Isaac, and nodded slightly to Ryan, Queenie, and Kaden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several people's expressions changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, why are you here?" Queenie said hurriedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said calmly, "This matter happened because of me. How could I not come?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he looked at Brad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression suddenly turned cold and stern. "Are you Brad? You want to leave? Have you asked me before? You come and go as you please. What do you think of the Augustine family? I think you should stay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, the </span><span>room fell silent</span><span>.</span></p><div class="pagination">
