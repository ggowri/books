  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying power erupted in Osborne's body, causing him to groan instinctively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His short hair grew quickly and instantly turned into waist-length hair. His hair was blood red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His two tiger teeth grew long and sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His nails became long, as sharp as daggers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even his face became paler and more angular.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Raymond's lightning struck Osborne's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom! The lightning hit Osborne. Its speed was so fast that he had no time to dodge. The powerful lightning left a charred area on his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next second, the charred color disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was safe and sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a strong body!" He couldn't help but be shocked. He was sure that after transforming into Vampire, he could withstand Raymond's attack. After all, Raymond's power only reached Class C+.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the transformation, Osborne's body was probably equivalent to that of a Class C martial artist or a little weaker. There was a gap to that of a Class C+ metahuman, but the gap was not significant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne transformed into a Vampire, his body became stronger. He could withstand several attacks from a Class C+ metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne didn't expect his body to be so strong after he transformed into a Vampire. It was far more potent than he expected. Raymond's attack only made Osborne feel slightly numb and hurt a little bit of his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, after the transformation, his body seemed to have a terrifying recovery ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The injuries left by the attack were healed instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great!" Osborne smiled confidently and stared at Raymond coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond was stunned at this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blood Clan? You are actually a Vampire! Damn it! The information is wrong!" Raymond cursed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he did not panic. "Even though you are a Vampire, so what? I control the power of thunder and lightning, the most powerful elemental power! Today I will use the power of the lightning to blast you into pieces!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Raymond waved his hand, more lightning struck Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of each lightning was extremely terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond believed that if all the lightning hit Osborne, he would definitely be seriously injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered and suddenly moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He operated Satan's Eye to the limit, and the speed of lightning became slow in his eyes. Last time, because his body was not strong enough, he could see the lightning but could not avoid it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he thought he could give it a try!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly calculated the trajectory of the lightning in his mind and rushed out at an extremely fast speed. He actually dodged the lightning above his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom! The lightning struck the ground and disappeared in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were crackling sounds in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More and more lightning struck, but Osborne dodged them deftly. He calculated the trajectory of the lightning and actually ducked all of the lightning. Not a single one hit him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can it be? It is impossible!" Raymond was so shocked when he saw this that he screamed in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he owned the lightning power, he had encountered many masters in the past few decades, and many of them were utterly powerful than him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had never seen anyone who could use speed to dodge all his attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking advantage of speed to avoid lightning? It was simply a fantasy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lightning was so fast that most people were struck before they could even see it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a metahuman at Class B or a martial artist&nbsp;at Class B could only withstand the lighting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprisingly, Osborne dodged all the lighting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond was dumbfounded. Even if he controlled the lightning elemental, which had the most powerful attack power, what was the use if it couldn't hit Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I must go now!" Raymond thought he had to run away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond had no way to attack Donna because Donna's earth elemental restrained his lightning. Her power was like a turtle shell, and his lightning could not strike Donna at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond was not afraid of Donna because she could not attack him either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne was different. He could attack Raymond. When Raymond found that his lightning could not hurt Osborne, he immediately felt a sense of crisis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond wanted to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before leaving, he threatened, "Bastard, you dare to ruin the organization's action. Just wait for the organization's revenge. Someone will come to kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, he rushed toward the passage in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted coldly, "You want to escape? Have you got my consent? I was playing with you just now. The warm-up is over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Osborne's long hair suddenly swayed and&nbsp;soon&nbsp;became&nbsp;several dozen yards&nbsp;long. Like countless ropes, his hair entangled Raymond's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being restrained, Raymond felt horrified. "Fuck off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He roared, and endless lightning suddenly burst out of his body, burning and breaking Osborne's long red hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, after the long red hair broke, it did not fall but immediately extended, wrapping Raymond more and more tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Raymond was entangled by the red hair and could not struggle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne caught him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond finally felt fearful.</span></p><div class="pagination">
