  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having dealt with the troublesome members of the Keynes family, Osborne returned to the Urban Development Exchange unruffled and seemingly unfazed by what had just transpired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the personnel there now eyed him with a mix of awe and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking out four Celestial Deity warriors with such ruthless efficiency&mdash;that was nothing short of brutal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celestial Deity warriors were the backbone of most clans, the cream of the crop. Normally, such a powerhouse commanded respect wherever they went.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in Osborne's hands, they were reduced to mere husks without mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ruthless" and "ferocious" were now his calling cards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast to Osborne's calm demeanor, Betty and her sisters looked visibly troubled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty furrowed her brow, voicing their concerns with a hint of apprehension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lachlan Swift, did we go too far? By crippling those four, we've definitely antagonized the Keynes family of the Crimson Ironhoof Clan. They won't just sit back and take it&mdash;there will be retribution."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne flashed a smile. "Do you think I was too harsh? If I didn't show how vicious I can be, how would anyone be deterred? If they think we're pushovers, they'll all take turns trampling us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need to be ruthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our Human Community has been pushed around in Wild Flame City because of its supposed ruthlessness? No, it's because of our weakness!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A solid punch to ward off a hundred more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for making enemies of the Keynes family&mdash;what's there to fear? Even if we hadn't crippled them, they would still come after us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their only consolation would be if we groveled at their feet, submitting to their every whim. Do you really want that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's piercing gaze locked onto Betty and her sisters. His expression was stern. "It's time for a mindset shift! Don't fool yourselves into thinking that backing down will make amends. The more you retreat, the more enemies will see you as weak and prey upon you. Even a child knows you don't turn your back on a wild beast. Instead, you confront it head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our only path is forward, displaying unwavering strength and ferocity. That's the only way to make them retreat, to make them quiver in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And with fear comes peace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Making enemies of the Keynes family? That's a trifling matter. If it comes to it, we face them head-on, tooth and nail. For the Human Community to stand tall in Celestara, we must confront countless more powerful forces and engage in countless battles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only through blood and war can true peace be forged. Cowering will only lead to subjugation, stripping away any hope for our race!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we quake in fear at the mere threat of the Keynes family, what's the point of Spark of Blaze? Let's all disperse and return to being their slaves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's words hit hard, leaving Betty and her sisters pale and ashamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They lowered their heads, biting their lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lachlan Swift, we've realized our mistake. We understand what we need to do now," they murmured, lifting their heads with determined, fierce glints in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's words struck them like a revelation, cleansing their souls and solidifying their resolve. Each sentence was a sledgehammer, shattering their frivolous notions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not ruthless, not stable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A powerful punch warded off a hundred more!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only through war and blood could peace be achieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Settling for compromise and cowering only led to enslavement!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why had Osborne crippled Kerwin and his companions? He intended to send a clear message to the other clans&mdash;mess with him, and he wouldn't hesitate to get rough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne had let Kerwin go unscathed, others would assume Osborne was just another weakling, just like the rest of the Human Community, afraid to confront the other clans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That would invite endless trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right." A melodious voice suddenly echoed from outside the Urban Development Exchange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A figure then stepped in, shrouded in black energy, making it impossible to discern her appearance or divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only clue was her femininity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne instantly recognized the voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's you again?" Osborne frowned. "I told you not to follow me. I don't want any more trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The figure didn't respond directly but murmured to herself, "Only through war and bloodshed can true peace be achieved. Cowering only invites enslavement, extinguishing the hope of an entire race. You're absolutely right!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't in the mood for further conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the woman spoke up again, "I'm not here to bother you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The manor you want to buy&mdash;it's mine to sell. If you don't welcome me, I'll leave right away."</span></p><div class="pagination">
