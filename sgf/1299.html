  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could hardly believe that, in such a short span of time, they had managed to take down eleven Transcendent Deity warriors from the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If memory served him right, he had only accounted for three of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other seven? Those were the handiwork of Divine Shadow and God of Star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow, in particular, had a vendetta against the Deschanel Clan that rivaled Osborne's own. When the opportunity for revenge arose, she unleashed her full power. Despite being injured, she had managed to entangle five of the Deschanel Clan warriors in a fierce struggle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That single moment allowed the Blood Demon members to swarm in and eliminate them one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, all eleven Transcendent Deity warriors from the Deschanel Clan were slaughtered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining Transcendent Deities from the Deschanel Clan weren't fools; they wouldn't dare engage the Blood Demon members any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, they fled, their expressions gloomy and filled with rage as they glared at Osborne and his allies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence, leading the charge, was practically grinding his teeth to dust. "Damn!" he roared, his fury erupting like a volcano.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he felt utterly powerless. Once a pinnacle Deity Overlord, he now found himself reduced to the strength of a mere Transcendent Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with Osborne, Divine Shadow, God of Star, and over four thousand Blood Demon members, Terrence knew he stood no chance. If he hadn't been fleet of foot, Terrence would have been ensnared by Divine Shadow and overwhelmed by the Blood Demon horde!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Damn it all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence's voice was laced with despair. Eleven elders of the Deschanel Clan had just been wiped out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clan had barely over twenty elders left, survivors from the Age of Gods, and now they had lost more than half in a single blow. How could he possibly accept this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had just awakened from the Sanctuary Casket, enduring a millennium of solitude, only to meet their end like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body trembled with rage and frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Terrence forced himself to remain calm, aware that acting impulsively would be futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deschanel Clan was already defeated! The moment the Blood Demon members displayed their might, he knew they had lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, survival was the only thing that mattered!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only by living could they hope to regain their strength and seek vengeance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence steadied himself, his voice cold and calculated. "Fine, fine! The Augustine family, I'll remember you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, the Deschanel Clan has fallen, but don't get too cocky! One day, we will rise again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When that time comes, I will personally wipe out the Augustine family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will flay every last one of you and scatter your ashes to the winds! Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Terrence led the remaining Transcendent Deity and Superior Deity warriors of the Deschanel Clan in a swift retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Divine Shadow felt a surge of urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to chase after them but was stopped by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on! There's no point in pursuing them. Even if we catch up, we can't stop them. Right now, they only want to escape, and with just the three of us, we'd be risking our own necks without the Blood Demon members backing us up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow's frustration only deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So we just let them slip away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, a glint of determination in his eyes, "Let them escape? Not a chance! I told you, the Deschanel Clan must be annihilated today! No one gets to walk away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But for now, we don't need to chase them. Let's focus on eliminating the rest of the Deschanel Clan members first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he fixed his icy gaze on the fleeing Deschanel warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence and the other Transcendent and Superior Deity members could escape because of their speed, outpacing the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the rest of the Deschanel Clan, including the Junior Deity and Intermediate Deity members, had no hope of getting away. They simply weren't fast enough to outrun the relentless pursuit of the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they fled in a frenzy, the Blood Demon members closed in, swiftly executing their grim task of slaughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The skies above echoed with the shrill cries of agony and desperate pleas for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched it all with a hardened heart. If the Deschanel Clan sought to annihilate the Augustine family, they ought to have been prepared for the consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the Deschanel Clan was defeated, and their time had come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne commanded the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finish them all! Leave none standing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his fervor, he even reopened the dimensional portal, summoning Sebastian, Bryce, and others from the Augustine Bastion to join the carnage against the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within moments, the Deschanel Clan, numbering in the thousands, was wiped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every last member of the clan was hunted down and ruthlessly dispatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Osborne led his forces into the Deschanel Clan's sanctuary, swiftly ending the lives of the few stragglers hiding within. The battlefield fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Satan's Eye swept the area, ensuring not a single Deschanel Clan member remained alive. Satisfied, he nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family had achieved a resounding victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only eighteen Transcendent Deities, led by Terrence, and nine Superior Deities managed to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Osborne's gaze fell upon the sixty-three Sanctuary Caskets within the Deschanel Clan's sanctuary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There had once been a hundred such caskets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thirty-seven of them, Osborne had already pilfered and stored in his Dimensional Space. The remaining caskets, he naturally wouldn't let slip through his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were invaluable treasures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne swiftly collected all the Sanctuary Caskets.</span></p><div class="pagination">
