  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up instantly at the sight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The 1 to 100 odds were even higher than he expected. Apart from him, the highest odds on the championship betting list were only 1 to 60.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "It seems Phantom Commerce Guild doesn't favor me, but that's actually a good thing for me. If they did, how could they offer such high odds?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne couldn't help but feel a burst of joy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With 1 to 100 odds, if he bets 100,000 Sacred Crystals and wins the championship, he will earn 10 million Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ten million Sacred Crystals are enough to buy a very decent mid-grade Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, for Phantom Commerce Guild, ten million Sacred Crystals are nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, you can start betting," the middle-aged man said with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his heart, he felt Osborne was just here to give money to the casino. After all, their professional analysis team believed Osborne could at best aim for the top ten, with almost zero chance of winning the championship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyone betting on Osborne to win the championship is essentially giving money to the casino.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since it's free money, they naturally won't miss it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and took out all his 170,000 Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hesitating slightly, he turned to Leroy and Clara behind him and said, "How many Sacred Crystals do you have? Lend me some for now. I'll return them in full after the Zone Duel ends."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt that betting only Sacred Crystals was really too little.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such an opportunity is rare; he must earn as much profit as possible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy said, "Don't say that. If it weren't for you, we wouldn't even have the chance to be here. I have 120,000 Sacred Crystals; can I give you 100,000? The reason I'm not giving you all of them isn't because I'm unwilling, but because I want to keep some to bet alongside you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly upon hearing this. "Of course, it's a loan! I can't just take your things for free. As for you wanting to bet alongside me, you'd better think it through carefully; after all, there's still some risk involved."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy said, "I'm not afraid! If you dare to bet, why wouldn't I?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as she finished speaking, she took out 100,000 Sacred Crystals and handed them to Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara immediately said, "I don't have as much as Leroy; I only have 50,000 Sacred Crystals."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then lend me 30,000 Sacred Crystals! For the remaining 20,000 Sacred Crystals, just bet alongside me like Leroy," Osborne said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While making money himself, he naturally wanted to help Leroy and Clara profit as well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The premise was that they could trust him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara nodded in agreement, "Alright! But actually, I can also pledge Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, she looked at the middle-aged man and asked, "Can Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> be pledged here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The middle-aged man was slightly surprised upon hearing this. "Pledge Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>? Of course! How many points do you have? They can be pledged at a one-to-one ratio!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara gave a faint smile and took out her badge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She earned 100 Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> in the Sect Tournament, placed second in the City Duel with 9,000 points, and tied for fourth with Leroy in the State Duel, earning 700,000 points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, her badge displayed a total of 791,000 Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara said, "I'll pledge it all!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The middle-aged man was stunned upon seeing Clara's badge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over 700,000 Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> meant Clara ranked fourth in the State Duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He carefully examined Clara's face and suddenly realized. "You're Clara from Zephyr State, right? Sorry, I didn't expect you to be the genius participating in the Zone Duel. Your Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> can be exchanged for 791,000 Sacred Crystals!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara nodded in confirmation and pointed at Osborne, saying, "All the Sacred Crystals I get from the pledge will be handed over to him to handle!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Leroy also took out her badge and said, "Then I'll pledge my Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy's badge displayed 708,100 Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the City Duel, she was injured due to the backlash from the Sacred Artifact and ultimately couldn't face Clara, securing only third place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, her Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> were exactly 1,000 points less than Clara's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The middle-aged man said, "You're Leroy from Zephyr State? No problem! All your Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> can be used as a pledge!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy nodded and replied, "The Sacred Crystal I pledge will also be handled by him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt extremely surprised at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It turned out that Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> could actually be pledged at the Phantom Commerce Guild. This was essentially a form of borrowing. If repayment couldn't be made within a certain period, the Phantom Commerce Guild would directly acquire their Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Theoretically, Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> and Sacred Crystal can be exchanged at a 1:1 ratio, but in reality, their value far exceeds this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For many factions, Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> are far more important than Sacred Crystal because they can be used to exchange for rare treasures in the Glorious Divine Kingdom's treasury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These treasures are nearly impossible to buy, no matter how much money is spent outside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne couldn't help but feel grateful to Leroy and Clara.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he also took out his badge and said, "In that case, I'll pledge my Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's badge had over a million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the State </span><span>Duel</span><span> champion, he directly earned one million </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>. The City </span><span>Duel</span><span> champion gets ten thousand points, while the Sect Tournament champion gets one hundred points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This action completely shocked the middle-aged man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over a million </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> meant Osborne was the State </span><span>Duel</span><span> champion. However, among the hundred states in Eastern Zone 3, he knew every champion but had no idea who Osborne was.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After carefully examining him, a look of surprise appeared on his face. "You're Osborne, the State </span><span>Duel</span><span> champion of Zephyr State? Sorry, I didn't recognize you earlier. It seems you've changed quite a bit since the State Duel."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile without offering much explanation. "Now, please place all the Sacred Crystals we three pledged, along with these 300,000 Sacred Crystals, all on me. I bet on myself to win the championship!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Osborne finished speaking, the middle-aged man immediately widened his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although many people would bet on themselves to win at the casino, like Valentino from Rose Rebels or Brenda from </span><span>Skyearth</span><span> Dominion, their bets were relatively small, usually not exceeding 100,000 Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They did this more to show confidence to the outside world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne actually placed a bet of nearly a million Sacred Crystals on himself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, Leroy, and Clara's combined Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> could be mortgaged for 2,427,300 Sacred Crystals, plus the 300,000 Sacred Crystals the three gathered, making Osborne's total bet over 2.7 million Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne ultimately wins the championship, with odds of 1 to 100, he will earn over 270 million Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This number is simply too massive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For the Phantom Commerce Guild, two or three hundred million Sacred Crystals might not be much, but for the casino under their banner, it's still a huge fortune.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The middle-aged man looked serious but eventually nodded. "No problem! We are a casino under the Phantom Commerce Guild; no matter how much you bet, we can handle it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he quickly got to work.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the bet was placed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne bet over 2.7 million Sacred Crystals, while Leroy and Clara each bet 20,000 Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After finishing all this, Osborne left the casino.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A determined expression appeared on his face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was a bet of over 2.7 million Sacred Crystals; he absolutely couldn't accept failure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, he had to win the Zone </span><span>Duel</span><span> championship no matter what.</span></p><div class="pagination">
