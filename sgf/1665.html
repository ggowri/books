  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Diana explained the details, Osborne finally grasped the concept of the Miracle Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He learned that there were no varieties to distinguish between them; instead, their effects were represented by their colors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Red Miracle Elixir enhanced one's realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yellow Miracle Elixir boosted Divine Body levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blue Miracle Elixir improved elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>White Miracle Elixir healed injuries and could even resurrect the dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Black Miracle Elixir elevated soul and comprehension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless of color, all Miracle Elixirs could enhance one's potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a rush of excitement as he gazed at the three different colored Miracle Elixirs just within reach, a red one, a blue one, and a white one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blue Miracle Elixir, perched atop the head of a massive stone figure, offered a significant boost to elemental essence. Under normal circumstances, breaking through from Level Six peak to Level Seven was exceptionally challenging. But consuming this blue Miracle Elixir could greatly increase his chances of achieving that breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One could become a Quasi-Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My space elemental essence has already reached Level Seven. With my Divine Body at a solid Level Nine, by these standards, I'm almost a Quasi-Deity King already!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only thing holding me back is my realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's why the red Miracle Elixir is crucial to me. If I take it, my realm will surge, potentially propelling me from mid-Celestial Deity to Deity Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That would give me a fighting chance against someone like Angelo, a true Deity King!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought sent a thrill of anticipation racing through Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got to get my hands on that red Miracle Elixir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was ablaze with determination but kept his cool, patiently waiting for the right moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "Then there's the white Miracle Elixir, capable of healing any injury, even resurrection... For me, it's not that useful. But I can only imagine how crazy Calvin would go for it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile flickered across Osborne's face at the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Diana. "I want all three of those Miracle Elixirs!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll find a chance to snatch them up. The red and blue ones will boost my strength, while the white one&mdash;well, I'll pass that on to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes widened in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to give me the white Miracle Elixir? Are you serious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her breath hitched. While the white one was of little use to Osborne, for Diana, it could mean life itself&mdash;a second chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In many ways, it was the most precious of them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, Osborne was offering her the white Miracle Elixir? Diana's breath caught in her throat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I didn't do anything. I can't accept it! You should keep it for yourself. After all, all Miracle Elixirs enhance one's potential. The more you use, the greater your potential, and the higher your future achievements will be."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled at her words, his expression serene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't just keep all the good stuff for myself. We're in this together! As friends, allies, and partners in battle, there's no way I'm hogging all the benefits. For now, let's not act like we've got the Elixirs yet. I'm just saying you should accept it once I manage to grab it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana bit her lip, holding back her emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was already in debt to Osborne in so many ways, and taking another Miracle Elixir from him felt like nothing much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's focus shifted back to the battle on the platform as he scanned for an opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, most of the Deathborn had charged toward Angelo and the others, with over four thousand Celestial Deity-level foes surging toward them. Angelo and his group formed a tight defensive circle, bracing for the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the relentless onslaught, none of the Deathborn posed a threat at the Deity King level, nor were there any Deity Overlord peak fighters among them. As a result, they simply couldn't break through Angelo and his team's defenses. Angelo's power was overwhelming, and he was swiftly cutting through their ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of Deathborns was dwindling rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne noticed a shift. The forty-nine Deity Overlord peak Deathborn, who had been kneeling before the massive stone figure, could no longer contain their fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of them rose to their feet, their eyes blazing with rage, and charged toward Angelo and his group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surrounding the stone figure, only seven Deathborn remained, still bowing in submission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes gleamed with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seven of them! Facing seven Deity Overlord peak Deathborn is no small feat, but it's not impossible. I have to act now! If I wait until Angelo wipes out the Deathborn army, all those Miracle Elixirs will fall into his hands, and that's something I absolutely cannot allow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought fueling his resolve, Osborne prepared to make his move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, let's strike together! With your current strength, you should be able to handle one of the Deity Overlord peak Deathborn without too much trouble, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's expression turned serious at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lip, weighing her options. "I can hold off two of the Deity Overlord peak Deathborns, but I won't be able to keep it up for long. If it drags on, I might not be able to last."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A spark of hope ignited in Osborne's chest at her response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two? That's more than enough! Let's get moving!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a plan forming in his mind, Osborne and Diana made their way toward the center of the platform, where the Miracle Elixirs awaited.</span></p><div class="pagination">
