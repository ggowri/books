If you guys haven't become Class A masters, you'll barely survive. You guys are not strong enough, so continue to stay here and train."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, the guys were anxious at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, we want to help you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I want to help you too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt touched, but he said indifferently, "No! You guys aren't powerful enough, I can't let you die in the battle. Until you break through Class A, you absolutely can't take part in the battle. Isaac, please watch over them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac nodded when he heard that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't think they should go either, but I can't convince them. Now that you put it that way, I promise I won't let them take a step out of here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne finally nodded in relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about it, Osborne walked over to Isaac's side and took out a dozen or so blood diamonds from the Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These blood diamonds could quickly make Osborne raise his realm power, but as far as he was concerned now, blood diamonds were useless, and it was completely inferior to the speed of raising through devouring star power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These dozen</span><span> or so blood diamonds were what Osborne had left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He handed over the blood diamonds to Isaac and said, "Isaac, these blood diamonds can quickly boost their realm power, so you should distribute them to Nathan, Queenie, and the others in order to help them improve quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope they've all surpassed Class A by the time I get back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he finished speaking, Isaac was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne didn't say anything more and just waved his hand. "Everyone, attention!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Set off immediately!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, we will counterattack, and our first target will be the headquarters of the Draco Group in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>!

I haven't been paying attention to it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb smiled helplessly, "I can see you don't know it yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should check the ranking list first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded when he heard that and hurriedly opened the Draco Star Wristlet to check the ranking list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two days ago, Osborne was number one on the ranking list, two thousand points higher than Vincent in second place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought that the ranking list wouldn't change after only two days, so he hadn't paid attention to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, seeing the ranking list, Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could that happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, on the ranking list, Osborne was no longer in first place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent was in first place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent's score had reached four thousand five hundred points, which had improved by three thousand five hundred points compared to two days ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a situation certainly wouldn't shock Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had known for a long time that Vincent was the most powerful amongst the younger generation of the main bloodline in the Augustine family, and he was also the only one who had reached Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent had already reached Class AAA, and he was extremely powerful, definitely not comparable to clone men like Duke Medusa or Duke Titan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now even Osborne wasn't sure to defeat Vincent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was a genius, so he was always more powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could kill Duke Medusa at Class AAA with his realm of Class AA, while a genius like Vincent might not make it. Besides, Vincent's realm had already reached Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Osborne was not surprised that Vincent could raise his points by three thousand five hundred in two days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What truly surprised Osborne was Vincent's name, which had turned gray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Vincent dead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne asked with a frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb shook his head. "He's not dead, but he was irritated by your points, so he made </span><span>a very dangerous move. Eventually, he suffered a siege from many of the warriors from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> who had reached up to Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although he cooperated with Declan to kill two members of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> who had reached Class AAA and a number of Class AA warriors, he was severely injured. He escaped with great difficulty, and he had returned to the Augustine family in Newport City to recover from his injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was said that he was hurt so badly that he wouldn't fight again anytime soon, so he has quit the heir selection."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne breathed a sigh of relief after Caleb finished speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was only seriously injured, and he didn't die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Osborne and Vincent were in a competitive relationship, Vincent was the talented descendant of the Augustine family after all, and Osborne didn't want him to die just like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when Osborne saw the following of the ranking list, he was stunned once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because he realized that Emma and Matthew's points were already very close to his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Owen's points were not far from him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
