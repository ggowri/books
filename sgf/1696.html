  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ninth Dark Deity Legion in the East Zone was made up of four divisions</span><span>: t</span><span>he Wild Flame Army, the Inferno Army, the Thunderwind Army, and the Firestorm Army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among these, the Inferno Army was the strongest, followed closely by the Thunderwind Army, while the Wild Flame Army held the third position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within the Divine Peak Nine base, there were a total of 400 thousand troops, with each division comprising around 100 thousand soldiers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The highest leaders of these divisions were the Vice Commanders, all of whom were powerful Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that, aside from Angelo, there were three other Deity Kings at the Divine Peak Nine base</span><span>: </span><span>Chandler Parris from the Inferno Army, Arnold Adkins from the Thunderwind Army, and Mariah McKellen from the Firestorm Army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, Chandler was the strongest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hailed from the Fire Tiger Clan, one of the top ten Upper Races under Lord Malevolence. According to Angelo, Chandler was a tier above him in strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arnold, from the Thunderstorm Drake Clan, and Mariah, from the Wood Elf Clan, were on par with Angelo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the three of them teamed up, they could only just hold their own against Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Lord, the one we need to watch out for the most at Divine Peak Nine is definitely Chandler! Although you're incredibly powerful and have eight equally strong Spatial Clones, controlling him will be quite a challenge. Plus, there's still Arnold and Mariah to consider," Angelo warned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne fell into deep thought at Angelo's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Has Chandler reached the mid-stage of the Deity King realm?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew that the power gaps between each small stage in the Deity King realm were even greater than in the Deity Overlord realm. If Chandler had indeed reached the mid-stage, that would pose a significant problem for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo shook his head. "Not quite yet! Only the Commanders of the four divisions have reached the mid-stage of the Deity King realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, Chandler is very close. It's said that his potential hasn't been fully tapped, and he could very well advance to the mid-stage of the Deity King realm in the near future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So he hasn't reached the mid-stage yet. That's good news! Think of a way to lure them out so we can deal with them. Once we've taken care of them, it'll be much easier to manage the 400 thousand troops at the Divine Peak Nine base."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo nodded in agreement, saying nothing more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Osborne was confident, he just needed to faithfully execute his orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll head back to the base now and find a way to bring them here!" Angelo declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go for it!" Osborne replied, waving him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo and Edison quickly departed</span><span> and made </span><span>their way back to the Divine Peak Nine base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stayed behind, leaving his Spatial Clones in place while he entered the Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, Anastasia, Grandpa Sebastian, and the others were already deep in their training, absorbing the power of the Celestial Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were rapidly advancing in their realms, pushing past the peak of Deity Overlord and striving for the Deity King realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not wanting to disturb them, Osborne called for the members of the Blood Demon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The excitement in their voices was palpable as they looked at Osborne. They were the first group he had transformed into Blood Clan members, and they had supported him through thick and thin. To Osborne, they were not just loyal subordinates; they were friends and comrades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been twenty years since they last saw Osborne, completely cut off from contact, and now their eyes were misty with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne greeted the Blood Demon members with a warm smile, creating an atmosphere filled with camaraderie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, he waved his hand, and a mountain of Celestial Crystals appeared before them, shimmering with dazzling hues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The multitude of crystals radiated a rich, pure energy that immediately filled the Blood Demon members with a sense of bliss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne began, his voice steady and filled with conviction. "First, I know you've all reached the limits of your potential. Under normal circumstances, you'd be stuck at the peak of the Deity Overlord realm, possibly becoming Quasi-Deity Kings but never truly attaining the Deity King status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But, with these Celestial Crystals, your potential can be reignited! I sincerely hope each of you can break through your limits and rise to become true Deity Kings. We can then fight side by side once more!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here are 50 thousand Celestial Crystals for you to take as you need. If you find it's not enough, I will provide more. You were the first to stand by my side in battle, and you are the ones I trust most deeply. No matter how many crystals you use, I will ensure that you all become Deity Kings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His declaration hung in the air, and the Blood Demon members felt their hearts swell with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They understood the vast chasm between their potential and that of true geniuses. Without Osborne's intervention, they might have been unable to reach even Class S, trapped forever in mediocrity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here was Osborne, offering them a chance to elevate their power and pursue the path to becoming Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their expressions turned resolute as they responded in unison, "Mr. Augustine, you can count on us! We won't let you down! We will become Deity Kings as soon as possible!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
