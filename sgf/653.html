  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After learning the Intermediate Level of spatial power, Osborne began to study dark power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dark power he obtained was only for a short time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he tried to communicate with the dark elemental and understand them deeply, he found it difficult to do so as it was obvious that he had not yet reached that level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned and stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that now is not the right time! I couldn't control over the dark power. It is too difficult to force myself to comprehend the Intermediate Level use of the dark power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that case, I'll try the Thunder Power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have already mastered the Intermediate Level of Thunder Power, Thunder Explosion. But I feel that Thunder Explosion is not very useful. I need to improve Thunder Explosion or comprehend a new application of Thunder Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have mastered two Intermediate Level uses of the light elemental ability, Dissolving Light and Light of Redemption. The Thunder Power must also have different uses."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne started trying again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, things would go much more smoothly. His control over lightning elemental powers had already reached the Intermediate Level. It was even easier for him to comprehend it than the space elemental.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time passed slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every once in a while, Osborne would use the Draco Star Wristlet to learn about the situation in the outside world. At the same time, he would use the Satan's Eye to check on Clarissa who was in seclusion in a safe house not far away. Only after making sure that everything was fine would he continue to practice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time passed, Osborne's understanding of the lightning elemental became more and more profound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He vaguely felt that he was about to break through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this time, he did not notice that an uninvited guest had come to the Augustine Estate not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Duke Medusa No. 7!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa's face was cold, and she looked in a distant direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"According to the information I recently received, Osborne's girlfriend, Clarissa, is hiding there, trying to break through to Class A!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We set a trap and waited for him for ten days, but he didn't take the bait. He is probably hiding nearby to protect his girlfriend!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph, you made us waste so much time, you deserve to die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, I will catch your girlfriend!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll see if you show up or not!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Medusa quickly rushed towards a villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The underground safe house in that villa was where Clarissa was in seclusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Medusa arrived near the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're hiding underground? Then I'll force you out first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Medusa suddenly stomped her feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire villa shook violently. The ground was shaking, huge cracks appeared, and the sturdy villa was also cracking and collapsing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the underground safe house was strong enough and would not be destroyed so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the violent vibration had affected the stability of the safe house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa, who was in the safe house, felt something unusual at the critical moment. She frowned. The powerful aura on her body immediately became disordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, who was not far away, also felt something unusual instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly woke up. Satan's Eye opened. And he immediately saw Medusa standing above the safe house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne's face changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "How did she get here? How did she know the location of the safe house? Damn it. Medusa will ruin Clarissa's practice and make her fail!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Medusa must be stopped!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking, Osborne immediately broke out of the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Medusa had raised her foot again. Terrifying power gathered on her feet. Even if it could not crush the safe house, it would definitely affect Clarissa's practice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, at this time, Osborne took action in time. He waved his hand and a bolt of lightning struck Medusa's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Medusa saw Osborne, she was surprised. Her eyes were cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She immediately stopped and quickly moved away to avoid Osborne's attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne breathed a sigh of relief when he saw this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Medusa coldly and asked, "How did you find me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa smiled. "I have to say that you hid very well. If there hadn't been a traitor in your family who informed me that your girlfriend was in seclusion here, I really wouldn't have been able to find you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face turned gloomy when he heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "A traitor from the Augustine family informed you? Humph, you are trying to sow discord! The Augustine family doesn't even know I'm here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa shrugged. "Who knows? Anyway, I can be sure that it was someone from the Augustine family who told me. I don't care if you believe it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because you are going to die soon! You've been hiding for ten days. It's time for you to go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After this, Medusa's eyes suddenly flashed with a cold light.</span></p><div class="pagination">
