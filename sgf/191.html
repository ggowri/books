  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, you don't need to stress. Viper Squad has seen it all overseas. They're all top-tier. At least C-class fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And they're well-coordinated and equipped with the best gear. We've got this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek appeared reassured by Apollo's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just make sure you stay sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Winning this will make a huge difference for our family. If you pull it off and marry Clarissa, you'll be the next head of the family, no question."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a final encouraging pat on the shoulder, Derek walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Silent Valley was a vast, circular canyon stretching about six miles in length and about half a mile wide. It featured two closely spaced entrances, flanked by towering, steep mountain peaks. The canyon itself was filled with ancient, towering trees and was overrun with thorns and dense underbrush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danger lurked everywhere with poisonous insects and venomous snakes, making it nearly impossible for ordinary people to navigate through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the highest point on the canyon's edge, there had been a massive temporary platform set up for viewing. From there, the elite spectators could see nearly every corner of the canyon, and the platform offered a perfect vantage point to witness the action below.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Directly beneath the platform, in the heart of the canyon, a massive tree stood with a flag planted at its peak, marking the coveted prize for tonight's competition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Skyefall Security and Chevalier Security would each send thirty elite operatives from opposite ends of the valley to try and grab the flag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The team that managed to get the flag and carry it out through their opponent's entrance would win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the Radcliffe family's convoy arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, along with eight Skyefall Security bodyguards and several of the Radcliffe family's personal guards, escorted Clarissa, Donna, and Barlyn to the platform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top family representatives quickly came over to greet them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After exchanging pleasantries, they made their way to the front of the platform, where the representatives of the five families and the Chevalier family were gathered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek gave Donna a curt nod. His status was far superior to hers, so his demeanor was rather cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, he was the only head of the seven families in Skyefall to attend personally, making him the most important figure present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His attention finally turned to Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smiling, he said, "Clarissa, you've grown even more beautiful. My son's lucky to have you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's face shifted slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at Osborne and, seeing his calm reaction, relaxed a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She responded coolly, "Sir, it's a bit early for those kinds of comments. Apollo and I not even married yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek was momentarily taken aback but shrugged it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's bound to happen sooner or later. I've already discussed the details with your grandfather. Your wedding to Apollo will be arranged within a month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And we'll be family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A month?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's face hardened, her grip tightening into fists, but she remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's talk about it then," she said firmly, turning her gaze back to the flag in the valley, clearly signaling she wasn't interested in continuing the conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek's irritation showed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph, you're just as arrogant as they say. But once you're married to Apollo, we'll see how long you can keep up that attitude. Mayby City's top beauty'? Maybe then I might..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A disturbing excitement and sleaze flickered in Derek's eyes as he pondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought he was hiding his feelings well in the dim light, but Osborne caught every detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's anger flared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This old jerk is actually thinking about Clarissa? She's supposed to be his son's fianc&eacute;e! Asshole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Chevalier family is truly despicable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keeping his cool, Osborne walked up behind Clarissa and whispered, "Clarissa, I need to step away for a bit. Stay safe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa bit her lip, clearly worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She whispered back, "Osborne, be careful. Don't take any unnecessary risks. Even if things go wrong, we'll face it together. Just come back safely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave her a reassuring smile and a gentle squeeze of her hand while no one noticed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. I'll be back soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the head of Clarissa's security team, his departure went unnoticed in the crowd eagerly waiting for the competition to begin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the valley entrance, Apollo and Valentin were already facing off. Soon, they would lead their teams into the valley to compete for the flag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Valentin, you're still short two people. How long are we going to wait? Can't you even gather thirty skilled fighters?" Apollo sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Might as well just give up now. I won't go easy on you. If you end up dead in the valley, don't blame me for being too harsh!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
