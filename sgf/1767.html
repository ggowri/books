  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosemary's expression was as cold as ice. "You want me to fight for Human Community? Dream on! I'm back for myself, and that's it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anita couldn't help but frown at her words. "Rosemary, you've changed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I've changed." Rosemary shot back with a bitter laugh. "I've died once. Do you remember? When I was lost in the cycle of reincarnation, who fought for me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Night could have protected my reincarnation, but he didn't lift a finger! He let my reincarnation get married, let her become tainted. He clearly didn't want me back, so why should I fight for Human Community? If Lord Malevolence wipes them out, what do I care? I can just leave Celestara!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This universe is vast and boundless. With enough power, I can go anywhere. I'm just waiting for him to explain himself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he wants me to fight for Human Community, he better come begging. He'd better marry me. Otherwise, even if the entire Human Community dies in front of me, I won't give it a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And right now, I'm done talking to you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't tell me where Isa is, I'll find her myself. When I do... I'll kill her. Because Isa doesn't deserve him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Rosemary turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anita's voice rang out, firm and commanding. "Rosemary, stop right there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calm down! You know that without him, none of us would be here! Back then, we were just a bunch of starving orphans! If it weren't for him, we'd be dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He taught us how to cultivate and gave us resources to grow. We're just his attendants! You, me, God of Destiny, God of Life, and God of Space&mdash;we're all his attendants!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We admired him, we worshipped him! It was only after we became powerful that we developed these foolish fantasies. It's not his fault he didn't return our feelings. He never owed us anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And right now, he's doing something incredibly important, and Isa is a crucial part of that! If you go after Isa and mess up his plans, he won't forgive you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So please, Rosemary, just calm down! Wait for him to come back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He'll explain everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anita's gaze was serious as she stared at Rosemary, and her words carried the weight of truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone else overhearing her might have been left speechless, realizing that God of Light, God of Time, and even God of Destiny, God of Life, and God of Space were all mere attendants of God of Night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosemary lowered her head, and her fists clenched tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! I'm just his attendant, and I haven't forgotten that. But I also haven't forgotten that before I burned myself out for him, he promised to marry me. So, I'm not in the wrong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that cold declaration, Rosemary's figure vanished in an instant, leaving Anita powerless to stop her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sighing heavily, Anita murmured, "Master, when are you coming back? Where are you now? If you don't return soon, we won't be able to hold on..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a heavy heart, she returned to her throne, regaining the commanding presence of the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bring me news from East Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to know what's happening with the 'Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings.' If possible, bring them back&mdash;don't let them die out there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood!" A soft voice came, and then a flash of light disappeared from the grand hall, leaving Anita alone with her thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the bustling streets of Wild Flame City within East Zone, the air was electric with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Intergroup Clash Challenge Tournament? The Seven Young Deity Kings of Human Community are challenging all the young warriors of our various clans? If we beat them, we can win the Supreme Malevolence Sword and Shield, ten thousand Celestial Crystals, and five Miracle Elixirs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gasps of astonishment filled the air, and the crowd's breathing grew rapid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Seven Young Deity Kings of Human Community are asking for their own deaths!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They killed Aldrich and Alfred, so it makes sense they have the Supreme Malevolence Sword and Shield, but how on earth do they have ten thousand Celestial Crystals? How could they possibly have five Miracle Elixirs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is the arena set up near the Divine Peak Nine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could they have obtained Celestial Crystals and Miracle Elixirs within Divine Peak Nine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warriors from various clans were stunned, and their minds reeled with the possibilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, be quiet!" Orson's voice cut through the murmurs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a super genius from Thunderstorm Drake Clan, one of the top ten Upper Races. His command silenced the crowd immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orson continued, "Whether the Seven Young Deity Kings of Human Community can actually produce that many Celestial Crystals and Miracle Elixirs or not, they have set up this arena and are challenging all the young warriors of our clans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We must respond. Otherwise, they'll think we're afraid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, they've been hiding for over a month, and no matter how hard we searched, we couldn't find them. Now that they've finally shown themselves, it's our chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will be the one to face them in the arena!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
