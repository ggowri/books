  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing the ruckus in the crowd, Osborne quickly turned his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top ten on the state duel strength leaderboard were all forces to be reckoned with. Some boasted powerful ancient bloodlines, others had mastered several Sacred Artifacts to perfection, and still, others had combat skills that far outshone their peers. Each of them had their own unique edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the top four were truly in a league of their own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had all managed to fuse three types of power ahead of the game, which meant their Sacred Power was leagues stronger than anyone else's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Benson was one of those four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was also intrigued by Benson. In his view, the only ones in the state duel who could really give him a run for his money were these four who, like him, had already fused three types of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Osborne caught sight of Benson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson came from the First-rate Power, the Resurgent Throne Palace. He was a prodigy of the Flame Phoenix Clan. Osborne's Satan's Eye scanned over Benson, and right away, he detected an incredibly terrifying power within Benson's body. It was like magma on the verge of erupting from a volcano&mdash;searing hot and domineering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the blink of an eye, this power transformed again, turning ice-cold and bone-chilling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression hardened in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was utterly taken aback.</span><br><span>Is this... the fusion of fire and ice elemental power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">On top of that, he must have also fused a dense and stable power! It's gotta be his divine power! His divine power is so thick and potent that he can merge two mutually exclusive forces together!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This fusion could yield some unexpected results!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This Benson is one tough cookie!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like Osborne, Benson had fused three types of power, and the intensity of his Sacred Power was no slouch compared to Osborne's. However, Benson's cultivation level had already reached the peak of Ascension Ten, a notch higher than Osborne's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, it was just the difference of one cultivation level, but still, it counted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne could also detect at least two distinct auras of Sacred Power emanating from Benson's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne recognized those were Sacred Artifacts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson had mastered at least two different Sacred Artifacts, which would give a massive boost to his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No wonder the strength leaderboard says Benson is a one-man army. Even if he goes it alone, he can easily land a spot in the top ten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He's really something! With that kind of power, he doesn't need a team at all. Even if Conrad's five-man team ganged up on him, they'd probably be no match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was sizing up Benson, and everyone around him was doing the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But out of the blue, in this situation, Benson suddenly turned his gaze towards Osborne, his brow wrinkling just a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson couldn't have cared less about the stares around him. After all, he was used to being in the spotlight wherever he went.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, he'd faintly felt a really chilling gaze, as if it could see straight through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He instantly followed that strange feeling and spotted Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he didn't notice anything out of the ordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's energy signature didn't give him the slightest sense of threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Weird, could I have been imagining things?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson didn't give it much thought. After all, before coming here, he'd already marked Agatha, Horace, and Broderick&mdash;those ranked higher than him&mdash;as his only real competitors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the rest, he didn't even consider them worth his attention!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He strolled to the front, crossed his arms, shut his eyes, and patiently waited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn, Benson's energy signature is off the charts!" the onlookers murmured among themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Conrad's team quieted down significantly, their faces solemn as they stared in Benson's direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how cocky Conrad was, he knew he didn't stand a chance against Benson in a one-on-one showdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, even with his four top-100 teammates by his side, they might still come up short against Benson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyhow, Conrad's goal was just to make it into the top ten.</span><br><span>We gotta steer clear of him in the state duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the top four spots were pretty much locked in, there were still six slots up for grabs, and he felt confident he had a shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the crowd let out another gasp. "Hey, look! Broderick's here too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A burly, hirsute man ambled over. His hair was a blazing red, as if his entire body was engulfed in flames. He was like a walking fireball, and just a single glance at him made one's eyes smart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly activated Satan's Eye and peered over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but mutter in awe, "Damn, what raw power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He must have merged his fire power with his physical and divine power. Whether it's the fire power, his physical might, or his divine power, they're all bound to be aggressive and explosive. So after the fusion, his Sacred Power is off-the-charts domineering!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">His attack power should be stronger than Benson's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Benson also opened his eyes and fixed his gaze on Broderick. Instantly, a fierce fighting spirit blazed in his eyes as he locked eyes with Broderick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Broderick flashed a grin and cracked his knuckles menacingly at Benson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!" Benson let out a disdainful snort, and his fighting spirit started to ebb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shut his eyes again, but he'd already turned extra cautious, sizing Broderick up as a formidable foe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Broderick hailed from the First-rate Power Fiery Volcanic Isle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On top of that, he boasted the royal bloodline of the Ebony Sheep Clan, wielding the clan's super abilities, and had mastered more than two Sacred Artifacts to perfection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One tough cookie!" Osborne murmured to himself, unable to stifle a twinge of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, another shout pierced the air. "Look! Horace is coming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone whipped their heads around, Osborne, Benson, and Broderick included. The moment their eyes landed on Horace, they instinctively squinted, their faces turning grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace, the second-ranked powerhouse on the state duel strength leaderboard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was from the First-rate Power Chilling Nether Palace and was renowned for his Sacred Artifact&mdash;the Frost-invoking Canvas. It was said that during a city duel, with a wave of the Frost-invoking Canvas, he'd instantly encased everything within thousands of miles in ice. Even the Empyrean Sacredness warriors watching from the high platform had a hard time holding their ground against it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, he breezed through and snagged the championship with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the guy who was rumored to be capable of taking a shot at Empyrean Sacredness powerhouses!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But right then, Horace looked as ordinary as Joe Bloggs, giving away nothing of his true might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was precisely what made people sit up and take notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The less obvious his power, the more cautious they got. It was a tell-tale sign that he'd mastered his power to an insane degree, way beyond what Broderick and Benson could pull off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though all three of them had fused three types of power, Broderick and Benson clearly hadn't got a full grip on that potent Sacred Power. Their power was like a leaky faucet, always seeping out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Horace? He'd sorted that issue out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One hell of a powerhouse!" Osborne could only catch a glimpse through Satan's Eye that Horace had fused ice elemental power, divine power, and soul power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He's fused soul power. His tricks must be something else because of that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the place erupted in a frenzy. "Look out! Agatha's here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone whipped their heads around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Agatha, the number one on the state duel strength leaderboard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like Benson, she hailed from the First-rate Power Resurgent Throne Palace. But in the grand scheme of things within the Resurgent Throne Palace, Agatha outranked Benson by a long shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was one of the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me among the top disciples in the Resurgent Throne Palace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha boasted the ancient and scarce Lightning Phoenix bloodline. On top of that, she'd fused three types of power&mdash;thunder power, divine power, and soul power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her Sacred Power was off the charts, and her control over it was on par with Horace's. What was more, she'd mastered the Ember Phoenix Clan's super-powerful Sacred Artifact, the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumor had it that when she played the Phoenix Cry Melody, it was like casting a spell. Anyone within earshot would be in a daze, and even Empyrean Sacredness powerhouses would have a tough nut to crack resisting its allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Zephyr State officials thought the world of her. They reckoned that even without any heavy-hitting allies, she'd shine like a star in the state duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All Agatha needed was a bit of that sweet, sweet luck, and she'd be the one taking home the state duel championship!</span></p><div class="pagination">
