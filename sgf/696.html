  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa forced a smile. Since Emma came to help her, she naturally wouldn't be jealous about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't think much about it, holding Clarissa with one hand and Emma with the other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's hand was icy cold as usual, while Osborne's hand was as burning hot as a hot water bottle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, not in the mood to think too much, tore open the dimensional rift and got in with the two girls. In an instant, the three of them disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few minutes later, after they took six interdimensional travels, Osborne finally stopped. He, who had consumed a tremendous amount of mental strength, looked a little pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, they had reached the sea. The three of them could only stop until Osborne recovered his mental strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne recovered his mental strength by activating Satan's Eye, harnessing ocular energy to seek out star power, and absorbing a large amount of star power. In this way, he could recover his mental strength while enhancing his body and soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma and Clarissa were both standing above the sea not far away, waiting for Osborne to recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa looked worried at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Emma was observing Osborne. When she found that he could absorb a large amount of star power during the day, she was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she wasn't able to activate Satan's Eye yet, she knew a lot about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that in order to upgrade the Satan's Eye from level five to level six, one needed to absorb the star power for seven consecutive days, during which his soul and body would be frozen by the star power. Therefore, most members of the Augustine family could not persist in absorbing the star power for seven days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, everyone could only absorb the star power at night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne seemed different. Even during the day, he could absorb a large amount of star power, while his soul was not frozen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is indeed extraordinary," Emma murmured and looked at Clarissa again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was more interested in Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, I'm a few years older than you. Can I call you Clarissa? You can call me Emma." Emma said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa bit her lip. She worried about her relatives and was in no mood to chat. But since Emma came to help, she couldn't give her a cold shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nodded. "Okay, Emma."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma replied, "Clarissa, don't worry. The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' target is just you and Osborne. Your relatives will be safe until they kill you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see." Clarissa also knew it, but she was still worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma asked, "By the way, can you tell me how you and Osborne met? I'm very curious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was reluctant to talk about this, but since Emma asked, she could only answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she gave a brief explanation, Emma looked envious. "I envy you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Envy me?" Clarissa was stunned and looked at her in puzzlement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I envy you, because you have a man who adores you, and you can fall in love with him. I'm different. I've no idea why I've been resistant to every man I met ever since I became conscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sometimes I doubt if I'm straight. Maybe I like women other than men." After Emma finished speaking, she looked at Clarissa with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was stunned when she heard this. She also looked at Emma and said calmly, "Whether you like men or women is your freedom, Emma. But I only like Osborne." She seemed to be conveying her refusal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma burst out laughing when she heard this. "Clarissa, don't get me wrong. I have no feelings for you. Now I'm sure that I'm straight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa breathed a sigh of relief. But soon she asked in confusion, "Why are you sure that you are straight now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma said calmly, "Do you want to know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't want to tell me, just ignore my question."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma shrugged. "I can tell you why. When Osborne held my hand just now, I found that my heart was beating wildly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she finished speaking, Clarissa was stunned, frowning tightly, looking at Emma vigilantly, and feeling a little uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Emma said calmly, "Clarissa, don't look at me like that. I'm not going to steal your boyfriend. Besides, do you think you are Osborne's only girlfriend? I detected the scents of other women on him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean?" Clarissa frowned tightly and clenched her fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I mean a brilliant man is destined to be pursued by plenty of women! I like Osborne too, but I don't want to hide my feelings, so I tell you about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's play fair." After saying that, Emma still looked at Clarissa with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's face quickly darkened, and she stared angrily at Emma.</span></p><div class="pagination">
