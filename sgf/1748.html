  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Wild Flame City, the most powerful forces weren't the Demonic Dragon Clan or the Soaring Lion Clan; they were the City Guard and the Wild Flame Army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With 500 thousand strong, the Wild Flame Army still had around 400 thousand stationed around the city, while 300 </span><span>thousand </span><span>City Guard were on duty within it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After such a monumental event, their presence was imminent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched as both the City Guard and Wild Flame Army gathered their forces, quickly encircling their position. If they didn't move soon, they would find themselves entangled in yet another battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The City Guard and Wild Flame Army were not to be underestimated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were well-trained and coordinated, with vice commanders being Deity Kings and battalion leaders at mid-stage Deity King levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they arrived, Osborne knew he wouldn't stand a chance against them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, the earlier conflict had already elevated the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings' notoriety, and he wanted to avoid further confrontations with the Wild Flame Army and City Guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Wild Flame Army and City Guard are almost here! If we don't leave now, we'll be in serious trouble!" Osborne called out to the Mystic Feather Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of panic washed over them. Those who had been hesitant just moments before now rushed to enter the Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They quickly grasped the reality. Staying meant certain death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Alfred and Aldrich dead, the Bowman family wouldn't spare them, and even if they hadn't killed anyone, they'd be associated with the chaos and likely be targeted for revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They realized the only chance for survival lay in fleeing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, the remaining hundreds of thousands of Mystic Feather Clan members hurriedly entered the Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Hannah and eleven Deity King warriors remained outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!" Osborne waved his hand, enveloping everyone in spatial energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they turned to leave, the ominous figures of the City Guard and Wild Flame Army drew near.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop right there!" a voice shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, a hint of defiance in his tone. "No need to see us off! Make sure to tell the Bowman family that my name is 'Theodore.' If they want to avenge Alfred and Aldrich, they're welcome to try and catch me! Good luck if they can!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he unleashed a ripple of spatial energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, they disappeared, successfully using interdimensional travel to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two ominous figures suddenly materialized nearby, their expressions gloomy as storm clouds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were the battalion leaders of the Wild Flame Army and City Guard, both at mid-stage Deity King level, yet powerless to stop Osborne and his group from vanishing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they surveyed the carnage around them&mdash;the ground strewn with corpses&mdash;their faces turned grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One barked, "Immediately inform the Bowman family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Report the situation here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Bowman family won't let this go! They'll be hunting those guys down without mercy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And they won't get far!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne and his companions, having made several interdimensional jumps, found themselves millions of miles away, deep within a dense jungle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they settled, Raoul, along with Maxime and other Deity King warriors from the Mystic Feather Clan, focused on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Raoul spoke up, his gratitude evident, "Thank you, Theodore! If it weren't for you, our Mystic Feather Clan would surely have been wiped out in Wild Flame City!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he bowed respectfully to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other Mystic Feather Clan Deity Kings followed suit, expressing their heartfelt thanks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all understood that without Osborne and his allies' timely intervention, they would have met a gruesome fate at the hands of the Bowman family, Demonic Dragon Clan, and Soaring Lion Clan warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "No need for thanks, my esteemed elders! The Mystic Feather Clan has aided the Human Community in Wild Flame City countless times. Helping you in return is only right. Besides, I'm here at Hannah's request; if anyone deserves your gratitude, it's her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah blinked in surprise, touched by his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She understood that Osborne was trying to bolster her standing within the Mystic Feather Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, she felt she didn't need that validation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After witnessing Osborne's strength and the power of Anastasia, Zoe, and the others during the battle, Hannah had made her decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being from the Mystic Feather Clan, a group that would never align itself with the "Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings," she sought to stand beside Osborne. Her heart burned with the desire to fight alongside him and the others, to carve their names into the annals of history on Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination, she spoke up, "It was my grandpa who encouraged me to do this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, our Mystic Feather Clan in Wild Flame City is bound to be hunted by the Bowman family. What should we do next?" She turned her gaze toward Raoul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raoul looked to Maxime, the top warrior of the Mystic Feather Clan in Wild Flame City, but Maxime's expression was one of shame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Raoul, you should make the call. If I had trusted you sooner, we wouldn't have lost so many clan members. From now on, I'm following your lead. Whatever you decide, we'll do it," Maxime said, his voice heavy with regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others nodded in agreement. "If it weren't for you, we'd all be dead. The future of the Mystic Feather Clan now rests in your hands."</span></p><div class="pagination">
