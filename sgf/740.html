  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I can already feel the bottleneck. I can sense that within the next few days, my mental strength is about to reach Class A level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Bowin said that once I break through to Class A, I'll be able to help you!" Zoe's eyes were filled with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne reached out and gently patted her head, his face softening with a doting smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Zoe's progress had been incredibly fast. It had only been a few months since Osborne picked her up from the slums of Mayby City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a few months, Zoe had gone from being an ordinary person to a Class B+. Now, she was about to break through to Class A.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such speed was enough to shock many people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne's progress had been even more astonishing, and his opponents had become increasingly stronger. So, up to this point, Zoe hasn't yet had the opportunity to help Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep at it. I believe you can do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne encouraged Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's power was incredibly unique; her singing could control anyone's soul, making them fall into a trance and forget everything else. Even those who were much stronger than her, far above her level, would be affected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Zoe reached Class A, her power would become even more formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew that Zoe's power would have a terrifying effect on the battlefield. No matter how many enemies there were or how strong they might be, Zoe only needed to sing a song from a safe place, and all the enemies would fall under her control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wouldn't even need to personally lift a finger to defeat a vast number of enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was precisely because her power was so strong that Isa had taken Zoe as a disciple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had always held great expectations for Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Makenzie appeared again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was extremely serious, and Osborne's heart sank immediately, a sense of dread washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Could it be that even here, they can't cure Anastasia's strange illness?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a wave of intense anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as Makenzie approached, she suddenly broke into a smile. "Mr. Augustine, rest assured. We have examined your sister's condition. She's not in too bad of shape. A very skilled doctor has worked to stabilize her life force by treating her body."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned upon hearing this. He knew Makenzie was referring to Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is her condition? Can it be cured?" Osborne asked, his voice trembling slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been so long since he had seen Anastasia awake. So long since he'd been able to hold her and speak to her properly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He missed Anastasia!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia was the most important person in his life. She was the one who had stayed by his side when he was at his lowest, wandering the streets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Osborne had to exchange his own life for Anastasia's, he wouldn't hesitate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was afraid of hearing bad news from Makenzie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, please don't worry. We've matched your sister's illness in our disease database. It is indeed a very rare condition, but with our medical expertise, we can fully cure her. It will just take some time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Makenzie finished speaking, Osborne's body trembled violently. His eyes instantly reddened, tears welling up and nearly spilling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She can be saved!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia can finally be saved!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia, you can finally be saved!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne lifted his head, holding back his tears, and asked earnestly, "Ms. Harvey, how long will it take for my sister's condition to be fully cured?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we spare no expense, it should take about a month."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Makenzie replied, aware of Osborne's urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne clenched his fists and gritted his teeth. "Then spare no expense! No matter the cost, she must be cured!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood, we know what to do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Makenzie nodded and went off to work, not saying anything more to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly felt a wave of weakness wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had waited so long and finally witnessed a miracle! He had fought tooth and nail to pass Godfather's heir test and had finally received good news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Anastasia could be saved!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he needed to do was wait one month!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just one month, Anastasia's strange illness would be completely cured, and she would wake up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A month would pass quickly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stayed at the medical research institute for a while, confirming that Anastasia had entered the normal treatment process. Seeing that he couldn't offer much more assistance by staying, he decided to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I want to stay here with Anastasia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe said, "Also, it's safe here, and I can use this time to break through to Class A."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment, then nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, but if anything happens, contact me immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying goodbye to Zoe, Osborne walked out of the medical research institute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to return to the Augustine family estate when a disheveled, scruffy man grabbed his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man looked like he hadn't rested for days, and his whole being was in a state of frantic frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, you're the new boss here, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We did it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was beside himself with excitement. "Sir, we really created the super energy pistol!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
