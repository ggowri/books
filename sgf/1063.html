  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One hundred Tauren Kings charged wildly, their target being the thousands of energy cannons on the nine peaks. They ran with such force that the ground shook, creating an incredibly intimidating aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attack! Kill them!" Wesson ordered loudly upon realizing Gerardo's intentions. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of the energy cannons changed targets, locking onto the one hundred running Tauren Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying volley erupted again. These energy cannons were massive, each standing several dozen feet tall, and their explosive energy attacks struck the Tauren Kings like nuclear weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leading Tauren Kings seemed unaffected by the hits, leaving only faint scorch marks on their skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As more and more energy cannons bombarded them, they finally sustained injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their defenses were finally breached after hundreds of attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, the heads of the Tauren Kings were shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the efficiency was simply too low. It took at least a hundred energy cannons </span><span>firing in three rounds to take down a single Class S Tauren King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As one Tauren King fell, the ones behind it rushed forward, their speed undiminished, even increasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This situation caused Wesson's face to change dramatically. "Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the defenses of the Tauren Kings, they needed to suffer only a third of the casualties to reach the energy cannons and destroy them all. This was something Wesson could not accept.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Gerardo predicted, these energy cannons were his last resort, his most powerful way against the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So far, these energy cannons had only killed a few dozen Class S clones. If the cannons were destroyed just like that, the battle would become extremely unfavorable for Wesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would have no way to fight against the remaining seven hundred Class S clones. "Class S experts, it's now critical. We must stop them. We cannot let them destroy the energy cannons," Wesson commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nearly fifty Class S warriors beside him changed their expressions. Gritting their teeth, they charged out towards the group of Tauren Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop them! We can't let them destroy the energy cannons!" With this thought in mind, they unleashed powerful attacks against the running Tauren Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greyson, Roy, Miranda, Fiona, and Ashley also joined the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite gathering hundreds of ancient families and dozens of superpowers, along with the Augustine family and the Draco Group, the coalition forces had only nearly fifty Class S warriors. Except for Wesson, who was commanding the battle, everyone else was deployed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Bryce joined the fight, wielding the Trident of Poseidon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because he relied too heavily on the power of the Trident of Poseidon and could not break through to Class S for a long time, he gave the Trident to Clarissa at Isa's suggestion. After cutting off his dependency on the Trident, he finally broke through to Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Clarissa had the Fate Staff, so she did not particularly like using the Trident of Poseidon and could not fully exert its power. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, the Trident of Poseidon returned to Bryce's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce, holding the Trident of Poseidon, felt an immense confidence. He believed he could challenge Gerardo in a one-on-one fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he knew this was just an illusion. He had no chance to fight Gerardo one-on-one, especially since Gerardo still had six hundred Class S clones ready at hand, and these clones could easily kill him like squashing an ant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he needed to do now was cooperate with other Class S warriors to block the group of Tauren Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to the hell." Bryce thrust the Trident of Poseidon forcefully into the body of a Tauren King. The weapon's power erupted, and he instantly killed the Tauren King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fifty Class S warriors had varying strengths. Those as strong as Bryce could easily kill a Tauren King, while the weaker ones found themselves helpless against the Tauren King's formidable defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they were still Class S. Even if it was difficult to break through the Tauren King's defenses, they could coordinate with the energy cannon attacks to quickly take them down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One Tauren King after another rapidly fell, losing over half their number in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The coalition forces felt invigorated, whereas Gerardo revealed a cold smile. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So soon you deployed Class S, and you sent them all? Wesson, it seems your cards are nearly played out. You have no trump cards left, do you? If that's the case..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
