  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced in the direction of the energy fluctuations, and his expression transformed in an instant, shock written all over his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? It can't be him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sprang to his feet, his heart racing as he realized that the figure approaching was not the anticipated coalition of the Dark Deity Legion but a single, battered old man&mdash;Jackie from the Prophet Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bloodied and swaying unsteadily, Jackie was a mere shadow of his former self, barely managing to stay on his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jackie!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne dashed forward, quickly reaching Jackie and wrapping an arm around him to support the old man before he could tumble to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A soft glow enveloped them as Osborne activated the Light of Redemption, channeling its healing power into Jackie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While it wasn't as potent against divine warriors, it was better than nothing. Jackie's pallor began to lift; his breath steadied as color returned to his cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What on earth happened, Mr. Flores? You look like you've been through hell!" Osborne pressed, his brow furrowing with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned deeply, his mind racing with concern. According to their agreement, the Prophet Alliance was supposed to be here, uniting with him to counter the formidable coalition of the Dark Deity Legion. Yet, they had failed to arrive as promised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given his prior dealings with the Prophet Alliance, something felt terribly off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His unease quickly transformed into dread as Jackie emerged, injured and barely able to stand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart sank, and he couldn't shake off the chilling feeling that a grave disaster had befallen their allies. "Could it be... has something happened to the Prophet Alliance? Did the Dark Deity Legion change their plans and launch a surprise attack on them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Jackie seriously, waiting for an explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackie looked up, his breath ragged, and immediately cut to the chase as soon as he had regained some composure. "Osborne! We've got a serious problem! You need to hurry and rescue Mr. Pike!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need your help for the Prophet Alliance and the Lord League!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mention of the Lord League made Osborne's expression shift from one of concern to alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord League? How are they involved in this? You've got to tell me everything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Breathless but urgent, Jackie recounted the events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three days ago, Mr. Pike came to you and learned that both the Pantheon League and </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization had surrendered to the Dark Deity Legion. Realizing the odds were stacked against us&mdash;just the Prophet Alliance and the Augustine family alone wouldn't be enough&mdash;he quickly took a dozen of our strongest warriors to Lord League, trying to convince them to join forces against the impending threat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But when Mr. Pike arrived and explained what was at stake, Eliot Monaghan, the </span><span>leader of Lord League, didn't believe him at all. He thought Mr. Pike was just spouting nonsense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliot couldn't fathom that the Pantheon League and the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization would ever betray humanity, believing it was just you stirring up trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackie's eyes burned with urgency. "While Eliot pretended to negotiate with Mr. Pike about how many warriors they'd deploy to assist the Augustine family, he secretly contacted the Pantheon League to confirm if it was true that they had indeed aligned with the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But that's when everything went south. The Pantheon League must have caught wind of his testing the waters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They struck first, teaming up with the Dark Deity Legion and </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, launching a massive assault with over a thousand Superior and Transcendent Deity warriors. They surrounded the Lord League, and we&mdash;Mr. Pike and our warriors&mdash;were caught in the crossfire."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the overwhelming strength of the Dark Deity Legion's tripartite coalition, Lord League was utterly outmatched. They suffered heavy casualties in an instant and were forced to retreat back into their Dimensional Microcosm to desperately defend themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew, however, that Lord League's Dimensional Microcosm was no match for the attacks of the Dark Deity Legion's tripartite forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hiding inside was just delaying the inevitable end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a last-ditch effort, the dozen or so warriors from the Prophet Alliance decided to work together and send some of their members out of the encirclement to seek help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among these breakout attempts, Jackie was one of them. Perhaps because he was only a Junior Deity, there weren't many who chased after him. Despite being heavily injured, he managed to break through the siege.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, while I was breaking out, Lord League's Dimensional Microcosm was already on the verge of collapse. If it gives way, Lord League and our dozen warriors from the Prophet Alliance will all be slaughtered instantly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, hurry and take your men to save them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackie's voice was frantic, his eyes begging for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression darkened. "Those morons from Lord League! Even if they didn't believe me, there was no need to expose themselves by testing whether the Pantheon League truly submitted to the Dark Deity Legion. What a bunch of idiots! Now they're being attacked first by the tripartite coalition of the Dark Deity Legion. They're getting what they deserved!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was clearly fed up with Lord League.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stupid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, since the Prophet Alliance warriors were also trapped, Osborne couldn't just stand by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give me the coordinates!" he demanded.</span></p><div class="pagination">
