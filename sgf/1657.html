  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Report to Mr. Angelo Royston! We've found significant signs of battle and blood ahead!" A peak-stage Deity Overlord warrior at the front of the group called out, urgency lacing his tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!" Angelo's voice was calm yet commanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he appeared at the forefront, surveying the remnants of the conflict and the bloodstains on the ground with an unruffled demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others quickly gathered around him, their expressions a mix of concern and curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The blood hasn't fully coagulated, which means the battle happened not long ago. It looks like a scouting team of about thirty met their end here, overwhelmed by at least a hundred Deathborn. No one escaped!" Angelo concluded, his voice steady as he waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within moments, over twenty bloodied medals flew into his grasp, and gasps erupted from the team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since they'd arrived at Divine Peak Nine, with Angelo, a Deity King, leading them, they hadn't encountered any real danger. In fact, they hadn't even seen a single Deathborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some among them had started to believe that Divine Peak Nine was less perilous than they had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, faced with the evidence of violence, the reality of their situation hit home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Angelo Royston, these fallen warriors were part of our Ninth Dark Deity Legion! Shouldn't we seek vengeance for them?" one of them asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo chuckled, a hint of irony in his smile. "Vengeance? Do you really think we can take them on? How many of our Ninth Dark Deity Legion members perish here every year? Our goal is the Celestial Crystal mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everything else is irrelevant! Let's move on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he issued the command to continue forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Athena and Calvin exchanged excited glances, their eyes gleaming with a sense of vindication.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They mused, "It seems Osborne finally bit the dust!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pairing that cursed woman with him for this expedition was a brilliant move! How long have they been here? And already, they've run into a horde of Deathborn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone's dead; not a soul escaped!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Athena and Calvin felt a rush of satisfaction, believing firmly in Angelo's assessment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he said no one survived, then it was undoubtedly true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of Osborne's demise lifted their spirits, making their steps feel lighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What they didn't realize was that just six miles away, Osborne was quietly observing them, keenly aware of the excitement and smugness on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! You thought I was dead? Enjoy your little celebration while it lasts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When the time is right, it'll be your turn to face the music!" he murmured to himself, determination hardening in his heart as he motioned for Diana to follow him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo's team pressed on, their purpose clear, not wasting any time as they headed straight for the Celestial Crystal mine. Even when faced with village-level and town-level Deathborn nests, they showed no fear, skirting around the edges without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deathborn occasionally appeared, probing their movements, but as soon as they ventured within two miles of Angelo, they were swiftly detected and eliminated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a day, the team had covered nearly nine thousand miles into Divine Peak Nine, deepening their journey into the unknown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they soon encountered their first major obstacle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ahead loomed a city-level Deathborn nest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to their plan, they were supposed to skirt around the nest from 60 miles away. But that path was risky - Deathborn patrols prowled those areas, and running into one would mean walking straight into a death trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they wanted to avoid being seen, they'd have to take a longer route around a mountain, which would not only consume more time but also lead them into completely uncharted territory filled with unknown dangers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes turned to Angelo, waiting for him to make the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of contemplation, Angelo spoke up, "Let's stick to the original plan and make a quick detour around the nest. I'll take out any patrolling Deathborn that get too close, ensuring they can't call for reinforcements."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The unknown territory beyond poses a greater risk than the city-level Deathborn nest. Plus, we can't afford to waste too much time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words resonated with the team, and they nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With renewed determination, the group pressed on along their planned route. Yet a palpable tension hung in the air; each member was acutely aware of the power housed within a city-level Deathborn nest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside such a nest, the number of Deathborn could easily exceed 100 thousand, with some estimates approaching a million deaths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A force of at least 10 thousand Deathborn warriors was a given.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While it was unlikely for a Deity King-level Deathborn to be present, the danger of being surrounded was still very real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Angelo felt the weight of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze darted around as he was vigilant for any signs of patrolling Deathborns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching from a distance, Osborne stroked his chin thoughtfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't let them have it too easy. It's time to stir up some trouble and get a sense of their true strength."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile crept across his face as he formulated a plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne created a Spatial Clone, sending it toward the city-level Deathborn nest.</span></p><div class="pagination">
