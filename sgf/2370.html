  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After leaving Elf City, it was very easy for Osborne to return to Racial Convergence Planet. With mastery of spatial power, Osborne easily found the direction to Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after, Osborne and Agatha stood on the land of Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is </span><span>Lanwood</span><span> State. It's located in Eastern Zone 3 of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, not far from Zephyr State. We just need to find a nearby city and use the translocator to return to Zephyr State," Agatha said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "I'm planning to return to the Mystic Sirius Sect in Tempest Fortress City to cultivate and enhance my strength. What are your plans next? Are you going back to the Ember Phoenix Clan?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha bit her lower lip, then shook her head and said, "I can't go back. Because of me, almost all the warriors of the Ember Phoenix Clan are dead. I can't go back and harm others again. Besides, those hunting me are likely within the Ember Phoenix Clan. If I return and reveal my identity, I'll be captured immediately."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she looked at Osborne and said, "Since I've decided to live under a different identity, I must completely cut ties with my past self. Unless I'm facing someone I absolutely trust or I have enough strength, I won't reveal my identity to anyone. So, I want to follow you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought for a moment, then nodded. "That works. You can follow me for now. I have a good relationship with Ms. Olsen, the Peak Lord of Peak Seven in the Mystic Sirius Sect. I'll talk to her and arrange for you to temporarily join the Mystic Sirius Sect and get an official identity. This way, you can better hide your identity."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, in that case, you won't be able to participate in the Eastern Zone 3's zone duel. With your strength, it's truly a pity not to take part in the zone duel."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha smiled and said, "It's nothing. After everything I've been through, I've figured it out. </span><span>So</span><span> what if I win the zone duel? Even if I win the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, so what? It's just a competition among warriors under Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Compared to those top warriors at Empyrean Sacredness, warriors below Empyrean Sacredness are like ants. So, next, I will focus on quickly improving my strength and breaking through my cultivation level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When I become a top warrior at Empyrean Sacredness, I will start seeking revenge. I will find those who hunted me down and kill them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha's eyes were filled with desire and killing intent. She craved power, so all she wanted next was to enhance her strength and seek revenge. She didn't care whether she could participate in the zone duel or the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "That's fine too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While chatting, the two arrived at a city. Using the translocator in the city, they smoothly returned to Tempest Fortress City. Then, they headed to Mystic Sirius Sect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, on the summit of Peak Seven in Mystic Sirius Sect, Angela was pacing back and forth in her residence with a very grim expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Have you still not received any news from Osborne?" Angela asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A Peak Seven Elder quickly replied, "Ms. Olsen, Osborne has not returned yet. We also haven't received any new information about Osborne. All we know is that Osborne used the translocator in Tempest Fortress City to go to </span><span>Moonsea</span><span> City eighteen days ago, and then he disappeared."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Near </span><span>Moonsea</span><span> City is the Moon Sea. During that time, the Moon Sea was completely leveled by a terrible battle. The entire Moon Sea disappeared. I'm afraid Osborne has already..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't finish, but his meaning was already clear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela's expression grew worse. She blamed herself, saying, "It's all my fault. I should have stopped him from leaving. If I had stopped him, he wouldn't have gone to </span><span>Moonsea</span><span> City, wouldn't have been involved in that battle, and wouldn't have..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, her expression changed, revealing a look of surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, her figure vanished from the spot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, at the entrance of Mystic Sirius Sect, Osborne had just entered when Angela appeared in front of him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela's face was full of surprise, but it was mixed with suppressed anger. "Osborne, you're finally back."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Olsen." Osborne knew that during the more than half a month he had been gone, Angela must have been very worried about him. So, he said apologetically, "Ms. Olsen, sorry for worrying you. I won't leave again in the coming days and will focus on training."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Angela suppressed the scolding she originally intended to say.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She nodded and said, "Alright. Anyway, as long as you're back, that's what matters. There's still over two months until the zone duel. By then, Ms. Alba will take the time to watch in person. You need to prepare well, improve your strength quickly, and ensure we don't lose face in the zone duel."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Angela looked at Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Agatha had already used the Sublime Concealment Orb to alter her appearance, aura, and even voice. Even Angela couldn't recognize her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who is she?" Angela asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly said, "Ms. Olsen, I left Mystic Sirius Sect this time to pick up a friend. Her name is Agnes, a good friend from my hometown. Now that she's just arrived on Racial Convergence Planet and has nowhere to go, I was hoping she could join Mystic Sirius Sect and Peak Seven. Is that okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Angela nodded in realization.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the beautiful Agatha, she misunderstood their relationship and nodded, saying, "Of course, that's not a problem. I am the Peak Lord of Peak Seven. As long as I agree, she will be a member of Mystic Sirius Sect's Peak Seven. Let's head back to Peak Seven first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Angela enveloped Osborne and Agatha with Sacred Power and brought them back to Peak Seven.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, Osborne made up some lies to explain where he had been during this time, finally deceiving Angela. After she left, Osborne breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Next, I need to focus on training. Ms. Olsen said we need to head to the zone </span><span>duel</span><span> venue five days earlier. So, I only have two months and five days left."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, I have a hundredfold time acceleration. These two months are equivalent to about eighteen years. In these eighteen years, I must raise my cultivation level to Ascension Ten and become a warrior at the Quasi Empyrean Sacredness level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, I need to elevate the elemental essences of my dark power, spatial power, Thunder Power, and fire power to the highest Ascension Ten, reaching the limit below Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In addition, I need to merge more powers. I must at least merge four types, or even five. Only then can I ensure victory in the zone duel."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After setting his goal, Osborne began training, accompanied by Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took out a Frost-kissed Heart. Countless blood-red tendrils emerged from his body, wrapping around the Frost-kissed Heart and beginning to absorb its power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the power of the Frost-kissed Heart was absorbed, Osborne's body grew stronger. Meanwhile, the ethereal third foundational carrier quickly became solid.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as the foundational carrier fully solidifies, Osborne will be able to merge the fourth power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Time passed slowly like this. A month had gone by in the outside world, while Osborne had been training for over eight years.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During these eight years, he didn&rsquo;t rush but steadily and slowly absorbed the Frost-kissed Heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he had finally absorbed all one hundred Frost-kissed Hearts.</span></p><div class="pagination">
