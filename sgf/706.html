It seemed that his light elemental essence was displeased with the lack of light in the environment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was angry and restless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then He felt that a powerful surge of light energy was eager to burst out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, after Osborne was shrouded by Palmers' Dark Realm, Clarissa and Emma could no longer see his figure, nor could they sense his presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their expressions changed, filled with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had their opponents, so they couldn't go to Osborne's aid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Fatebearer</span><span>, show me your power! Let me see </span><span>how </span><span>capable you are!" said Luca.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca gripped the giant ancient axe, sneering at Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa gritted her teeth. "Wanna know how capable I am? You'll find it out when you're dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, a pair of enormous wings suddenly appeared behind Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wings spread over 164 feet wide. One side was holy white, and the other was eerie black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Divine and Demonic Wings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's body slowly floated into the air. She gripped the Fate Staff tightly, pointing it at Luca.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wail of Fate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa whispered, and instantly, a wave of energy burst from the Fate Staff, rolling towards Luca like a sonic wave. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The endless wails echoed in the sky. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca's expression changed as he felt his blood begin to boil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned and snorted coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of trick is this? Let me break it with one swing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca suddenly raised the giant ancient axe and slashed forward. The sound waves </span><span>were instantly scattered, and the energy from the axe slashed towards Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's expression changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After just one exchange, she felt Luca's terrifyin</span><span>g power. She finally understood why Osborne had</span><span> such a tough time facing Luca.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying power he </span><span>possess</span><span>ed could destroy everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's Divine and Demonic Wings quickly folded, protecting her in layers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The giant axe slashed against the Divine and Demonic Wings. The wings trembled and flickered, but ultimately managed to hold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not bad defense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca was a bit surprised, but not panicked. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But how many strikes can you block? Today, I'll capture you alive and take you to the great King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, he raised the giant ancient axe and slashed down again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca's terrifying attacks overwhelmed Clarissa. She could only use her Divine and Demonic Wings to defend herself. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wings, made of energy rather than a physical entity like Osborne's Devil's Light, started to shatter and dissipate under Luca's relentless strikes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this continued, Clarissa would be in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lip, hiding behind the Divine and Demonic Wings' protection. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she gripped the Fate Staff tightly, pointing it at Luca, shouting, "Retribution for Fate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Luca had just swung the giant ancient axe down hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, the Fate Staff released a wave of energy, seemingly warping time and space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying phantom of t</span><span>he axe suddenly appeared in the void, slashing down towards Luca.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca was startled and tried to dodge but found it impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the massive axe slashed down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca's body was sent flying. A ghastly and terrifying wound appeared on his chest, nearly exposing the bone, with blood gushing out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He struggled to get up, looked down at the wound, and was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Retribution of Fate? It actually rebounded my attack completely, and it's even stronger than my original strike!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca's expression turned grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impressive! Luckily, I wasn't using my full strength just now. Otherwise, the rebounded force might have killed me! But you can't use that kind of attack many times, can you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile appeared on Luca's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's face was a bit pale. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Retribution of Fate technique indeed consumed a lot of her mental strength. With her current power, it would be difficult to use it again in the same battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Luca, who was injured but not seriously, and felt a bit regretful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry about how many times I can use it. It's enough to kill you! That&rsquo;s all that matters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca snorted coldly at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, really? Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca attacked again. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he held back from using too much power, fearing that Clarissa would use the Retribution of Fate on him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He began to repeatedly wear down Clarissa's strength, aiming to exhaust her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the moment, Clarissa's situation stabilized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to her, Emma's situation was much more dire.</span></p><div class="pagination">
