  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, everyone was watching Violet and Sharon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa and Barlyn both looked nervous. If either of them didn't vote for Osborne, he wouldn't become the bodyguard captain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither of them wanted to see that result.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris also watched them. He hoped his recent persuasion worked and they would vote for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne also watched them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the most nervous at this moment. Though they had promised him, he couldn't relax until the last second because he couldn't afford to fail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sharon and Violet exchanged a quick glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have both decided. We vote for Osborne," said Violet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they finished speaking, Osborne clenched his fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn and Clarissa also looked delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Harris looked at them in disbelief. He never thought they would vote for Osborne, who had just joined the team a few days ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Were they crazy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris couldn't understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna was equally puzzled. She looked at them in surprise, unable to understand why they both voted for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What benefits did Osborne promise them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna frowned, unwilling to accept this result. She would rather have Harris, Violet, or Sharon as the bodyguard captain than Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, the result is out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn said excitedly, "Osborne, congratulations on becoming the new bodyguard captain. Clarissa's safety will be in your hands now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly. "I will do my best."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, he looked at Donna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna's face was gloomy, but she couldn't go back on her word. She could only say, "Since that's the case, the new bodyguard captain is Osborne. I hope you all cooperate with him to protect Clarissa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sharon and Violet nodded. "We will cooperate well with Captain Osborne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris' face was gloomy. He didn't speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't accept losing to Osborne. It would have been easier to accept if Sharon or Violet had become the captain, but not Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since the result is out, I'll go rest first. When it's my shift, I'll fulfill my duties."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris said coldly and then turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned as he watched Harris' back. He knew Harris was unhappy with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't care much. He was now the captain. Whether Harris accepted it or not didn't matter. If Harris dared to disobey his orders, Osborne would find a way to get rid of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for your support."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said to Violet and Sharon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, facing Clarissa, he smiled and said, "Ms. Radcliffe, I will be protecting you from now on. If I don't do well, please forgive me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa smiled upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you don't need to be so polite. I feel very safe with you. Please take care of me from now on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she finished speaking, Donna's face turned even gloomier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa smiled at Osborne again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This girl is becoming more and more audacious and less considerate of my feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, I must talk to Clarissa again! It must be cut off if she dares to have anything with Osborne, even the slightest hint! And Osborne will harm her. I must find a way to get rid of him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna thought to herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't care what Donna was thinking. He immediately immersed himself in the role of bodyguard captain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't change the work assignments of the Bodyguard Units but personally checked the security situation at the Radcliffe Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to admit, the Radcliffe Manor's security was already very tight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he tried to assassinate Clarissa himself, it would be difficult to succeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But thinking that the Aberrants were trying to assassinate Clarissa made him worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because the Aberrants were strong enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The manor's hundred bodyguards and Class B warning system could withstand most dangers but not the Aberrants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The key question was, why did the Aberrants want to kill Clarissa?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How determined were they to kill Clarissa?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to figure these out to make appropriate arrangements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew that passive defense would eventually fail. Even if he protected Clarissa 24/7, there would still be times of laxity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to find the problem and take the initiative to solve it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before that, Osborne wanted to claim the third heir's reward. This reward must include a way to upgrade Satan's Eye to level four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Satan's Eye reached level four, his strength would greatly increase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he would be more confident in solving Clarissa's problems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne opened the Draco Star Wristlet and clicked the button to complete the test.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The third star on the Draco Star Wristlet lit up instantly, shining brightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Third heir's test completed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Reward being issued."</span></p><div class="pagination">
