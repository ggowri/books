  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The explosive power of Lord Malevolence was completely enveloped by the massive petals of Osborne's crimson lotus form. At that moment, with his absolute defense activated, Osborne was invincible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the terrifying force of the self-destruction, it couldn't harm him; all the energy was contained within the protective embrace of the lotus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deafening roar of the explosion echoed for what felt like an eternity before it finally began to fade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the petals of the crimson lotus slowly unfurled, they revealed themselves completely unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly returned to his human form, surveying the area around him. It was eerily empty, and he couldn't help but let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was over!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence had ultimately ended his own life in a desperate act of self-destruction, yet he had failed to bring about the devastation he intended for Celestara Planet. Osborne had managed to prevent the massacre.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his demise, a war that had raged for a millennium was on the verge of concluding. Even though the Dark Deity Legion still boasted fifty billion members and the Paramount Supreme Clan and all those factions under Lord Malevolence had numerous powerful warriors left, without Lord Malevolence at the helm, they would struggle to make any waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What awaited them was the reckoning from the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After enduring countless deaths and disasters, the Human Community finally saw the light of victory ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And all of this was thanks to Osborne&mdash;or rather, the God of Night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thousand years ago, Celestara Planet was a prosperous world under the reign of the Human Community. At that time, the God of Night was a well-kept secret, completely unknown to the denizens of the planet. He had secluded himself in a place known as the Court of the Sun, where he led a serene life with his six adopted maidens and a dedicated group of guards. They lived in peaceful seclusion, focusing on their training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their collective might was truly awe-inspiring, yet they maintained a hands-off approach to Celestara Planet's affairs. They had no desire to seize power or rule over the planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, they preferred to operate in the shadows, and every now and then, they would set off into the depths of space in search of precious treasures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the arrival of Lord Malevolence was a turning point that shattered the tranquility of Celestara Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His overwhelming power descended like a storm of destruction upon the Human Community, the rightful rulers of the planet. In a ruthless and bloodthirsty massacre, he wiped out ninety percent of the ordinary citizens. His aim was clear&mdash;to strike terror into the hearts of the remaining powerful figures and force them into submission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the surviving warriors of the Human Community were made of sterner stuff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They refused to bow down to tyranny and fought back with all their might. Sadly, their valiant efforts were in vain, as they were no match for Lord Malevolence's overwhelming power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when it seemed that the Human Community was doomed to extinction, the God of Night returned from his deep-space odyssey with his maidens and guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he beheld the scene of carnage and destruction that had befallen Celestara Planet, he decided to emerge from his long-standing seclusion at the Court of the Sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He made a resolute decision to safeguard the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, he declared war on Lord Malevolence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle that ensued was cataclysmic, shaking the very fabric of the world. In the end, the God of Night emerged triumphant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alongside his companions, they managed to seal away Lord Malevolence and many of his powerful minions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Night and his six maidens and guards were lauded as heroes and bestowed the prestigious title of the Seven Great Deity Kings of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tragedy, however, cast a long shadow over the victory. Only the God of Night and the God of Light survived the fierce conflict.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Four maidens and one guard sacrificed their lives in the line of duty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Consumed by grief, the God of Night retreated to the Court of the Sun, vowing to stay out of Celestara Planet's affairs from then on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, his body was plagued by a mysterious and dark ailment that worsened with each passing day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was in a desperate race against time to find a cure, knowing that only by doing so could he continue to push beyond his limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the years rolled on, his search for a remedy proved fruitless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Celestara Planet began to undergo a series of bizarre transformations. Forty-two divine peaks suddenly erupted from the ground, and an endless horde of Deathborn emerged from these peaks. To everyone's shock, they unexpectedly shattered the seal that had imprisoned Lord Malevolence, setting him free once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, the war reignited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, the God of Night's strength had waned. He could no longer defeat Lord Malevolence or seal him away; he could only barely hold his ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, Lord Malevolence began to gain the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Deity Legion, under Lord Malevolence's command, launched relentless assaults across Celestara Planet, eventually driving the Human Community back to the West Zone, where they struggled to survive. Most of the territory was now under Lord Malevolence's control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The suffering of the Human Community had truly begun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, over twenty years ago, the God of Night had a sudden premonition&mdash;Lord Malevolence's cultivation level was on the verge of a breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To finally put an end to him, the God of Night chose to undertake a perilous gamble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He transferred all of his powers to Isa, preserving his memories within her, and without hesitation, he entered the cycle of reincarnation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, in a corner of Blue Planet, Osborne was born!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, standing before Lord Malevolence, Osborne, as the reincarnation of the God of Night, had completely defeated him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's finally over!" Osborne exhaled deeply, a broad smile spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, there was no chance of Lord Malevolence returning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without their leader, the Dark Deity Legion was left disoriented. Despite their numbers, all that awaited them was reckoning&mdash;either submission to the Human Community, death, or a desperate flight from Celestara Planet to wander aimlessly in the cosmos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter the outcome, the Human Community would reclaim their dominion, and their suffering would come to an end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa approached Osborne, her presence a comforting warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa, Emma, Austin, and others&mdash;Anastasia, Zoe, Mila, Kendra&mdash;gathered around him, their eyes shimmering with tears of joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's over!" Osborne repeated, his smile radiant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone nodded vigorously, their faces lighting up with beautiful smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah! It's over!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We won!" Isa exclaimed, taking Osborne's hand, her expression a mix of tenderness and admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa quickly grabbed Osborne's other hand, matching Isa's gentle smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing both of his hands held, Emma and Austin exchanged glances before leaping into Osborne's embrace, holding him tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia and Zoe watched the scene unfold, giggling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a distance, the God of Light emerged from the Ascending Sacred Sanctum. As she saw Osborne surrounded by the women, a look of envy crossed her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Further away, the God of Time stood on the deck of the Sanctum of Night. She shifted her feet several times, as if wanting to approach Osborne, but ultimately remained rooted to the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her feet felt heavy, as if weighed down by tens of millions of pounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gazed at Osborne, her eyes filled with regret and sorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had once been his wife. As the reincarnation of the God of Night, he had fulfilled his promise by marrying her first, but she had made a grave mistake!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would have ever guessed that the once-penniless and powerless Osborne was, in fact, the reincarnation of the God of Night?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right at this moment, the Human Alliance was rejoicing in their hard-won victory, while the Dark Deity Legion was drowning in despair and descending into chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But none of this commotion could reach Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced tenderly at Isa and Clarissa standing beside him, then looked down at Emma and Austin nestled in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of the people he held dearest still alive filled his heart with an overwhelming sense of joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Isa's voice cut through the moment of bliss. "Osborne, what's our plan for the Dark Deity Legion? And what about the Paramount Supreme Clan? And all those factions under Lord Malevolence&mdash;what should we do with them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, it seems some of the allies Lord Malevolence summoned managed to slip away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should we go after them?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
