  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very puzzled, thinking, "Those who entered the jungle are all alive, and they all made it out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne had countless questions in his mind. He had seen those people trapped in the jungle, panicking as they tried to escape, only to be caught in a net of branches and eventually pierced through their vital points by the branches.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But those people didn&rsquo;t die and seemed completely unaffected.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt this was a serious issue.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, with May right beside them, Osborne didn&rsquo;t dare show any abnormality and casually asked Adriana, "Did Emperor Frederick and Queen Callista enter a strange place?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He was almost about to reach Imperial Empyrean Sacredness? Did you prepare in advance, leave a special tracking signal on him, catch up to him, and ruin his plan?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was very surprised and thought, "No wonder I didn&rsquo;t find Frederick, Callista, and Adriana on the Ancient Battlefield. Turns out, they really weren&rsquo;t on the Ancient Battlefield."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the Eighth Skyfall Casket, besides that Ancient Battlefield, there really are other spaces. Ms. Alba, this is all thanks to you. Otherwise, if Emperor Frederick had reached Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, things would have gotten troublesome," Osborne said with a serious expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to Adriana, even if Frederick hasn&rsquo;t reached Imperial Empyrean Sacredness yet, he&rsquo;s close. And he truly has the Inferior Imperial Artifact Armor and Inferior Imperial Artifact Sword.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Adriana reached Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, she is still no match for Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana's expression was very serious. "Osborne, let's return to Fairy Moon Sect first and discuss these matters later."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Emperor Frederick and the others will soon return to Racial Convergence Planet and Glorious Divine Kingdom. By then, he will definitely attack Fairy Moon Sect without hesitation."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the entire Glorious Divine Kingdom, apart from Fairy Moon Sect, all the First-rate Powers have already submitted to him. With his strength, Fairy Moon Sect might not be able to hold out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We need to return to Fairy Moon Sect now. It's best to leave Glorious Divine Kingdom with everyone from Fairy Moon Sect immediately. Otherwise, we'll be in trouble."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded seriously, his expression solemn.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was Osborne's first visit to Fairy Moon Sect, as well as Clara, Leroy, and Casey's. However, they had long been looking forward to seeing the strongest First-rate Power in the Glorious Divine Kingdom. At this moment, under Adriana's guidance, they quickly arrived at a snowy plain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the center of the snowy plain stood dozens of massive icebergs, one of which towered into the clouds.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is Fairy Moon Sect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fairy Moon Sect doesn't have many disciples, because joining it is extremely difficult&mdash;not only does it require exceptional talent, but also passing a character test.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fairy Moon Sect will never accept those with ill intentions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Fairy Moon Sect in the distance, Osborne felt a bit excited because he would soon meet Isa, Clarissa, Anastasia, and the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More than a year ago, they came together from Celestara Planet to Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, they joined Mystic Sirius Sect and met Angela. On Angela's recommendation, Isa, Clarissa, and the others all joined Fairy Moon Sect and even became Adriana's disciples.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, more than a year had passed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa and the others cultivated peacefully in Fairy Moon Sect, while Osborne, to pay respects to Michelle in the Royal Sepulcher, participated in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, won the championship, and entered Necropolis City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Counting the time, it had been more than a year since they last met.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go in first." Adriana led Osborne and the others into Fairy Moon Sect. Then, she immediately activated the defensive formation, shrouding the entire Fairy Moon Sect in wind and snow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana quickly introduced the situation of Fairy Moon Sect. "Fairy Moon Sect has a total of 100,000 disciples."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Among them, 80,000 disciples have not yet reached Empyrean Sacredness, while the remaining 20,000 have. Of these 20,000 disciples, nearly half are scattered across various small sects in the Glorious Divine Kingdom, carrying out missions."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've already sent them a message, asking them to return immediately."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. Back then, Angela was carrying out a mission in Mystic Sirius Sect. If it weren't for Angela, he might never have met Adriana, had any connection with Fairy Moon Sect, or become the Honorary Elder of Fairy Moon Sect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked, "How long will it take for them to return?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana said seriously, "If fast, one or two hours; if slow, it might take two days. During these two days, we can pack up everything in Fairy Moon Sect. Once everyone arrives, we'll set off."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Two days?" Osborne frowned but said nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana said, "Osborne, you don't need to worry about these things. Go meet Isa and the others first. I'm very strict with them, so their training has been tough during this time. If they know you're here, they'll definitely be happy. May and I will handle everything else."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, Osborne glanced at May, then nodded. "Alright."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, Osborne arrived at the depths of Fairy Moon Sect. This was where Adriana trained. Now, Isa, Clarissa, and a few others were Adriana's disciples, so they all trained here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Here, there is even a hundredfold Time Acceleration.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't disturb Isa and the others but quietly entered their training area. After activating Satan's Eye, he immediately saw them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne showed a gentle smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Isa, Clarissa, Emma, Austin, Anita, Anastasia, Zoe, Mila, Kendra, Diana, Hannah, and Bryce were all here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling their energy, Osborne couldn't help but be a little surprised, thinking, "Have they all reached Empyrean Sacredness? Moreover, they're all at mid Empyrean Sacredness. Isa has even reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness. As expected, under the teacher's guidance, their progress is really fast."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit envious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although his cultivation level was now at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, much higher than theirs, in fact, before entering Necropolis City, he hadn't even reached Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And that was just over a month ago.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before entering the Eighth Skyfall Casket, he was only at advanced Empyrean Sacredness. If he hadn't gained another opportunity in the Eighth Skyfall Casket, Osborne's current strength and cultivation level would at most be the same as Isa's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he had faced countless dangers and challenges over the past year, while Isa had reached the same cultivation level as him by peacefully cultivating in the Fairy Moon Sect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne envied her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who is it?" While Osborne was deep in thought, Isa seemed to sense something amiss. She suddenly opened her eyes, looking sharply in Osborne's direction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the next second, her eyes filled with joy and excitement, and her gaze softened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Honey!" Isa instantly appeared in front of Osborne, throwing herself into his arms, wrapping her arms tightly around his neck, and clinging to him completely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly held Isa, his face full of smiles. "Isa, did you miss me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa nodded vigorously, then bit Osborne's lips, kissing him passionately, her body trembling with excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was also very excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the others had not been alerted. Osborne ignored them, immediately carried Isa into the room, and pressed her beneath him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Isa shouted, "I want to be on top!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
