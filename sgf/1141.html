  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Screw it, let's take these beasts down!" the eldest man, probably in his forties, growled through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes blazed with fierce determination</span><span>. He was prepared to make these monsters pay dearly</span><span> </span><span>even at the cost of his own life</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others, however, were less resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all relatively young, the youngest being around twenty-two or twenty-three. Had it been just three months ago, a twenty-something Class A Master would've been hailed as a prodigy</span><span> and </span><span>would've commanded respect in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> at the very least.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in </span><span>superpower</span><span> factions, they would've been </span><span>seen</span><span> as future pillars of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But times had changed. The surge in star power had infused the world with unprecedented energy, accelerating growth even without formal training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nowadays, Class A warriors in their twenties were popping up in Ancient Families and even ordinary elite families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the super factions, only Class AAA warriors were considered elite, and only those reaching Class S </span><span>were pillars</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These three, fresh off their Class A breakthrough and not from any super faction, had little battle experience. Now, confronted with nine ferocious Class A Dark Exotic Beasts, they were paralyzed with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their bodies tremble</span><span>, faces drenched in cold sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their panic, they could barely muster </span><span>30%</span><span> of their true strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the elder man shielding them in front, they'd likely have collapsed by now. These beasts </span><span>would've been upon them without resistance, ending in a gruesome feast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elder man, seeing their dire </span><span>situation</span><span>, </span><span>burst out the</span><span> cry in hopes of igniting their fighting spirit. But the effect was minimal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the nine Dark Exotic Beasts moved in with </span><span>precision. They seemed more </span><span>cunning </span><span>predators</span><span> </span><span>than mere animals driven by instinct</span><span>, coordinated and cautious, forming an attack formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The older man's hope dimmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne and </span><span>Anastasia and Zoe had arrived just a few hundred yards away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They kept their presence concealed, unnoticed by both the beasts and the besieged </span><span>four</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia broke the silence, her voice tense. "Should... should we </span><span>help them</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These big tigers are just gross! They're nothing like I imagined. I hate how they make me feel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her brows furrowed tighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne arched a brow. "We'll rescue them, but not yet. These fools underestimated the danger, venturing deep into the </span><span>Lostridge</span><span> Mountains, which was </span><span>swarmed with Beast Tide, with merely Class A strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They need a harsh lesson first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia and Zoe nodded in agreement, ready to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the beasts made their move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They </span><span>avoided </span><span>the older man</span><span>, </span><span>the only real threat</span><span>, and</span><span> </span><span>zeroed in on the trio</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their massive bat-like wings flared, propelling them with explosive speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The foul odor of their breath clouded the air, sharp claws and fangs gleaming as they dove, set to tear through the unarmed trio.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three youngsters shrieked, eyes squeezed shut in terror, lashing out wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such frantic strikes, however, were no match for the Dark Exotic Beasts. These creatures boasted forms of immense strength and speed, effortlessly dodging the attacks and closing in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man's face paled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out!" he bellowed, desperate to rush to their aid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But three beasts had </span><span>blocked </span><span>him </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>reach</span><span>ing</span><span> them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thunderous crash echoed as all three were toppled in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Against the colossal beasts&mdash;resembling elephants&mdash;their forms seemed pitifully small.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Claws slashed, and they were wounded, but their Class A resilience held, preventing a gory disembowelment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet their end was nigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With heavy paws, the beasts pinned them to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those foul, monstrous jaws snapped shut, intent on devouring them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Panic-stricken squeals erupted again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the beasts looming for the kill, they wet themselves in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zoe, it's time to act!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew they couldn't delay any longer. These </span><span>fellows had clearly learned their lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe sprang into motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her lips parted, emitting three melodious syllables</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And t</span><span>he Dark Exotic Beasts within several hundred yards froze</span><span> suddenly</span><span> in place, </span><span>with </span><span>prey </span><span>in reach</span><span>.</span></p><div class="pagination">
