  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with the direct taunts of God of Light, Icy One couldn't help but respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a cold snort as his massive divine power projection materialized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Light, don't celebrate too early! The Human Community has only won three matches. There are still five more to go. Let's see if you can keep winning!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, in the last two days of the competition, the Human Community lost seven matches! We simply gave you three wins to keep you from losing all hope and quitting the game. What's there to feel proud about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light smiled faintly. "Oh, so you were just letting the Human Community win? Then you must be planning to get serious now, right? But if we still manage to win, doesn't that prove you're not as strong as you claim to be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's expression darkened even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth and said, "Don't worry. From now on, the Human Community won't win a single match! You've only won through special tricks, and you really think your talent and strength can compare to ours?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ridiculous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want to waste my breath arguing with you. Let's continue the competition! I'll make sure you see for yourself how the Human Community is crushed, just like the past two days. From here on, you won't win a single match!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Icy One's massive divine power projection disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light smiled calmly. "What happened in the past two days won't happen again. This time, the ones who won't win a single match are&nbsp;you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, God of Light's projection also vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the members of the Human Alliance couldn't hold back their excited cheers as they saw God of Light mocking Icy One. Their faces flushed with enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone could feel it&mdash;after three consecutive victories, the morale of the Human Alliance was on the verge of a full recovery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they were still hoping for more victories!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light turned to Osborne and said, "Osborne, I'll leave the next Deity King Level match to your Demon Slayer team. Yesterday, you told me you were 99% confident... I'm choosing to trust you. Now that I've made those bold claims, don't make me regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly and replied, "God of Light, your bold words were far too cautious. Next time, you can be a little more commanding!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave the rest to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, a cold glint flashed in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally, it's our turn! Now, the real shock begins!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne summoned the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, eight figures had gathered in the Ninefold Heaven's Tower, discussing their next strategy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't afford to lose the next match!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community has won three matches, and their morale has already recovered significantly. If we let them keep winning, all the work we put in over the last two days will be for nothing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's hear it&mdash;what should we do next?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's gaze swept across the other seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's not much to say. Our strength is still greater than the Human Community's. Under normal circumstances, we won't lose. However, the Hudson family's forbidden technique, the Draconic Formation, is a problem. None of us expected that over five thousand Hudson members could cast it together, creating such an overwhelmingly strong defense!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the Hudson family uses the same method again, it will be extremely difficult for us to win!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Two spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That situation won't happen again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Icy Six chimed in, "I've been stationed on the border battlefield and know the Hudson warriors better. If I'm not mistaken, the Hudson family's forbidden technique&mdash;the Draconic Formation&mdash;has formidable defensive power, but the side effects are devastating. They're essentially sacrificing their lives to cast it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, the Hudson family doesn't have that many peak-level Deity Kings! They won't be willing to sacrifice so many of their top fighters to use the Draconic Formation again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, in the next match, we don't have to worry about the Draconic Formation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Three added, "In matches above the Deity King Level, we won't have to worry about the Hudson family's Draconic Formation. However, God of Light seems strangely confident today, so we still need to be cautious!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For the next battle, we need to send out our most elite prodigies. To stop this losing streak, I suggest we have only Paramount Supreme Clan prodigies fight in the Deity King Level match!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we do that, we're guaranteed to win!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once we secure this Deity King match, we'll move on to the Supernal Deity King matches, where we have an even greater advantage. It'll be another streak of consecutive victories!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This way, we can still claim five victories today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"According to the rules, the Human Community will have to retreat their defenses by 124 thousand miles, which means they'll have to give up Peaks City. Once we take Peaks City, we'll gain the upper hand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can end the competition at any time and launch a full-scale attack, crushing the Human Community with ease!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished, the other seven's eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! The whole reason we agreed to this competition was to take Peaks City. If we win five matches today, Peaks City will be ours, and we'll have free rein to act as we please!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That ridiculous God of Light thinks we don't know she's trying to buy time? We're only playing along to secure Peaks City!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once the Human Community loses the strategic stronghold of Peaks City and their morale plummets, they won't be able to stop us! Within three months, we'll fulfill Lord Malevolence's orders and completely take over the West Zone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One nodded. "In that case, the next Deity King match will be fought entirely by Paramount Supreme Clan prodigies. We'll make absolutely sure to win this one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Icy One began making arrangements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, ten thousand Blood Demon members, clad in crimson battle robes, had marched onto the stage in perfect formation, instantly drawing everyone's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Icy One and the others saw that the ones entering the stage weren't Hudson warriors, they immediately felt relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A bunch of unfamiliar Human Deity King-level fighters!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It looks like we're guaranteed to win this one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One relaxed as a team of ten thousand Paramount Supreme Clan prodigies, all peak-level Deity Kings, appeared on the stage to face off against the Blood Demons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their arrival sparked loud cheers from the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the Human Community's side, everyone's faces turned pale with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're all Paramount Supreme Clan prodigies?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Icy One is serious this time&mdash;they sent out a team entirely made up of Paramount Supreme Clan prodigies. I'm afraid we can't win this one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This isn't just about whether we'll lose&mdash;it's about whether we'll be completely crushed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's over. How do we even fight against a team made up entirely of Paramount Supreme Clan prodigies?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For this match, I think we might as well just forfeit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, everyone in the Human Community had lost their confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Jethro frowned deeply, worry evident in his gaze as he looked at Osborne.</span></p><div class="pagination">
