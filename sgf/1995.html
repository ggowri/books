  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Victory!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Victory!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Victory!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a deafening cheer erupted from the Dark Deity Legion. Despite there being fewer than ten Unity Clan warriors still standing on the arena, a win was a win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The victors deserved every ounce of the applause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other side, the Human Community, the losers, had no time to mourn. There were still four more matches to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And these next battles? They were about to get a whole lot more serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of the fighters stepping into the ring next were Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the West Zone Human Community&mdash;billions strong, with trillions of fighters from all walks of life&mdash;the higher levels of Deity power like Transcendent Deities, Celestial Deities, and Deity Overlords weren't all that rare. Losing a few here and there wouldn't make much of a dent. Heck, a few deaths wouldn't even shake things up too much. But Supernal Deity Kings?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, that was different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were so few of them. Losing one of them would be a devastating blow for the Human Community right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The upcoming battles between the Supernal Deity Kings? If they played out like the earlier matches, with one side getting wiped out completely...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That would be a loss no one could bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even for the Unity Clan, losing too many Supernal Deity Kings on the arena would be a crushing blow, one that might not be easy to bounce back from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, yeah. The upcoming Supernal Deity King battles? They were make-or-break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The losers? They'd feel the pain, deep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get ready for battle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light</span><span>'s voice was as cold as ice, her expression unreadable, like the earlier defeat hadn't left a mark on her. But if you looked closely, really looked into her eyes, you'd catch the flicker of sorrow and fury lurking deep within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, no matter how angry she was, the fights had to go on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because if they didn't, the Dark Deity Legion would launch a full-scale assault. With the difference in their forces, every second would mean a hundred, a thousand more deaths for the Human Community than what was happening on the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the grand scheme, sacrificing a few to delay the inevitable war is worth it," </span><span>God of Light</span><span> kept telling herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes hardened, her voice dropping low, "Listen up. Get word to your fighters. For the upcoming battles between the Supernal Deity Kings, I have one request: it's not about winning. It's about... surviving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is going to be a long, drawn-out contest," she continued, her tone unyielding. "We, the Human Community, can lose these fights. We can retreat and fall back to protect the line&mdash;consider it a strategic retreat, buying time. But we can't afford more unnecessary losses. If we can't win, we surrender."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words hung heavy in the air, a weight that silenced the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But despite the gravity of it all, the group didn't hesitate. They got to work, immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of the hundred Supernal Deity Kings from Ascension One stepping into the ring next, half of them were from the leading factions. Their leaders swiftly passed on </span><span>God of Light</span><span>'s orders to the fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other half? They were from the Sanctum of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sanctum of Light was one of only two Sanctum-Level Powers in the Human Community&mdash;far stronger than Dukedom-Level Powers. Most of the Supernal Deity Kings fighting next would be from this faction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light</span><span> had given them their orders too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Do your best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it's too much, surrender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, the fifth battle began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both sides had a hundred Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings, and while the numbers were a hundred times fewer than before, the intensity of the battle was no less&mdash;if anything, it was even fiercer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the viewing platform, the sky and earth seemed to shake as Divine Ascendance Technique exploded in every direction. The air was thick with energy, and countless warriors from the Human Community and the Dark Deity Legion watched in stunned silence, their faces filled with awe and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For many of them, this was their first time witnessing a fight between Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this wasn't just any fight&mdash;it was a massive brawl between two hundred of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clash of unimaginable forces, the terrifying blasts of energy, the bizarre and deadly techniques, the sheer vitality that fueled these beings&mdash;it was all unfolding before their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, the Human Community lost the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of the hundred Supernal Deity Kings sent by the Human Community, twenty-two were killed, and sixty more were gravely wounded. Despite their best efforts, they couldn't pull off a win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the Unity Clan side, the casualties were slightly lower&mdash;fifteen dead and fifty wounded&mdash;but the toll was still devastating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though </span><span>God of Light</span><span> had ordered that surrender was an option, in the heat of battle, there often wasn't even time to utter those words before fighters were obliterated in the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, while this battle wasn't as brutal as the earlier ones&mdash;not nearly as many deaths, not as many total wipes&mdash;it still claimed the lives of thirty-seven Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the Human Community, it was another loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After five border competitions, they had won just one, and lost four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep going!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light</span><span> gritted her teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next up were the Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings, and many of the top leaders from the Human Community's major factions were stepping into the ring themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even more came from the Sanctum of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warriors from the Sanctum were all fighters </span><span>God of Light</span><span> had personally guided and trained. Losing even one of them felt like a knife to her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But still, the same truth rang in her mind...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sacrifice was necessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as they could hold out until the God of Night returned, this war between the Human Community and the Unity Clan could end without losing too many lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, </span><span>God of Light</span><span> couldn't predict how many from the Human Community would make it out alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe she, too, would fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe all of them&mdash;every last one of the hundred billion soldiers in the Human Community&mdash;would perish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to that, losing a few more on the arena seemed like a lesser cost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep going!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light</span><span> forced her emotions into a cold, unfeeling state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From the start, I've never cared about winning or losing. But, if we can win more, that's better. At least it'll boost the morale of the Human Community forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If we keep losing, though, the spirit of the Human Community is going to hit rock bottom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought this, but there was nothing she could do to change it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap between the Human Community and the Unity Clan was real. Winning would require not just stronger will and determination, but also luck&mdash;and, of course, the explosive rise of a few super geniuses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, the upcoming battle between the Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings didn't bring that kind of turn of events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Community had its talents, but the Unity Clan had even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, the Human Community lost again in the battle between the Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings. This time, the losses were a little smaller&mdash;only eleven Supernal Deity Kings fell, victims of bad luck and the inability to surrender in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the Unity Clan side, seven Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings lost their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next came the battle between Ascension Three Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Community lost again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, the Human Community's coalition had gone completely silent. Everyone was watching as their warriors fell one after another on the viewing platform, each defeat sinking them deeper into despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though there was anger, the reality of the power gap was undeniable. They had no choice but to accept it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was desperately hoping for a miracle&mdash;some extraordinary talent from the Human Community, someone who could defy the odds and turn the tide, bringing victory and honor, and crushing the Unity Clan's arrogance once and for all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the miracle never came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, the Human Community lost six Ascension Three Supernal Deity Kings, while the Unity Clan only lost two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then came the final battle&mdash;the showdown between Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This would be the last fight of the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings were far stronger than their Ascension Three counterparts. They had passed the second trial of the Ascension Stairway, making them even rarer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each one was a cornerstone for the Human Community's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, each side would send ten of their Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings into the ring for an epic clash&mdash;one that would shake the very foundations of the arena.</span></p><div class="pagination">
