  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne shared his plans, the excitement in the group was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They eagerly anticipated the Intergroup Clash Challenge Tournament, knowing it would lead them to West Zone, a territory firmly under the control of Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the others, except for Hannah, being part of Human Community in East Zone had been a constant source of discomfort. They faced ridicule, disrespect, and a sense of alienation that weighed heavily on their spirits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The prospect of finally stepping into the West Zone was a dream they had long yearned for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!" they cheered, practically buzzing with enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could hardly wait for the tournament to kick off, eager to take down the young geniuses from other races and then make their grand exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But of course, that was easier said than done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne needed time to prepare and allow the news of the tournament to spread, ensuring that all the talented warriors from various races would gather at Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He set the date for Intergroup Clash Challenge Tournament to be five days away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the meantime, he planned to make a trip to Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Satan's Eye had reached Level Ten, granting him extraordinary vision. With just a glance, Osborne could grasp the general layout of Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had mapped out the locations of each Deathborn Kingdom and pinpointed the spots where the Miracle Elixirs were found.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne decided it was time to venture into Divine Peak Nine to gather those precious Miracle Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll just go in to collect Miracle Elixirs. I won't get anywhere near the core areas, especially not the terrifying Shadow Terror Fiend or those root creatures. I should be fine!" he reassured himself, and determination settled in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia suddenly piped up. "Osborne, I want to go with you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm really interested in Divine Peak! My strength has grown. I can help you now. Let me accompany you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't shared the details about Shadow Terror Fiend or the root creatures with Anastasia and the others, fearing it would worry them. Now, with Anastasia wanting to join him, he felt a wave of uncertainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, he nodded. "Alright! But once we're in Divine Peak, you have to follow my lead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course!" Anastasia beamed, and her excitement was infectious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others wanted to tag along, too, but Osborne quickly shot them down. "You all need to stay in Hope Haven and focus on boosting your strength. Prepare for Intergroup Clash Challenge Tournament. If you end up losing to the young warriors from other races, it'll be a blow to your pride."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the rest of the group reluctantly accepted their fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew they couldn't match Osborne and Anastasia's power just yet, and the gap seemed to be widening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of them wanted to embarrass themselves in the tournament, so they decided to remain in Hope Haven, taking advantage of the hundredfold time acceleration and endless supply of Celestial Crystals to continue enhancing their abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was right, a hundredfold time acceleration!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Satan's Eye had broken through to Level Ten, and his time power had also become significantly stronger. Previously, he could only accelerate time in Hope Haven by ten times, but now he could easily manage a hundredfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he knew that even this was a far cry from God of Time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her injured state, God of Time had been able to accelerate time on Blue Planet by millions of times!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a level of power Osborne couldn't even begin to compare to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of God of Time darkened Osborne's expression, he clenched his fists tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "God of Time, it's been over twenty years. I wonder what her strength is like now. She's probably close to her peak again, being one of the Seven Great Deity Kings of the Human Community, capable of going toe-to-toe with Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if I break through to the Deity King's realm, I know I won't stand a chance against her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just wait!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Time, you nearly got me killed, throwing me into the chaotic currents of time and space, almost losing myself in the deep space!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I won't forget that debt!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Ophelia... no matter what, she was my ex-wife! You sealed her memories just to kill me, and that's something I can't accept!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Ophelia may have her issues, but she did try to stop you from taking my life. I will rescue her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Time, mark my words. I'm heading to West Zone soon, and when I do, I'll find you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne took to the skies with Anastasia, heading toward Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, a shocking piece of news spread swiftly through Wild Flame City, thanks to the connections of Darren, Guy, and others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Big news, big news!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings have finally emerged after hiding for over a month!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're hosting an Intergroup Clash Challenge Tournament! The challengers will face the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The leader, Theodore, announced that all the young geniuses from various races are invited to challenge them! Anyone who can defeat them will win the Supreme Malevolence Sword and Shield, along with 10 thousand Celestial Crystals and five Miracle Elixirs!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
