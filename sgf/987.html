  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the two Class S assassins from the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization rushed in, it was already too late. They could only stand there in stunned disbelief as Osborne's foot connected forcefully with Scarlett's head, a sickening crunch echoing in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rage, hatred, and fear coursed through them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlett was the only child of Sin and Crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been tasked with her protection, and now, witnessing her brutal death at Osborne's hands felt like a death sentence for them as well. Returning to the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization without her meant they'd face Sin and Crimson's wrath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't want to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only chance of survival was to kill Osborne and avenge Scarlett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're dead meat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the two Class S assassins unleashed their attack, shattering Osborne's Spatial Domain effortlessly. After all, he was a Class AAA fighter, and his Spatial Domain was only at the pinnacle of Level Two&mdash;a solid defense against Scarlett but nowhere near enough for two true Class S assassins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Osborne remained unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The backlash from his collapsing Spatial Domain hit him hard, but he pushed it aside, grinning coldly at the two advancing threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Much stronger than the Class S clones from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>! But still a bit weaker than Mr. Lambert. They're a troublesome duo but definitely not unbeatable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First things first, can't let them sneak up on me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne summoned his Volt Hammer, and a terrifying bolt of lightning shot down from the heavens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two assassins reacted instantaneously, darting to either side, narrowly evading the thunderous strike that obliterated their previous location, leaving behind a charred crater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weren't just any warriors; they were genuine Class S assassins, not the ragged clones he was used to facing. There was no way he would catch them that easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's try again!" Osborne said, swinging the Volt Hammer once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lightning crackled and arced toward the two figures, relentless in pursuit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although their movements were swift, it wasn't enough to completely escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, each of them was struck, dark scorch marks appearing on their chests, skin splitting open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their expressions twisted in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Volt Hammer was no ordinary weapon; combined with the </span><span>Thundergod</span><span> Gloves, it rivaled top-grade divine artifacts, making it far from easy to withstand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you bastard!" they shouted, their fury intensifying with their injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, they vanished from sight, fading into stealth mode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Stealth Art they used was similar to Scarlett's. He couldn't detect any spatial fluctuations, and even Satan's Eye wouldn't help here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remained calm. "Fine then, I'll just go with my old trick!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Light Realm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a pulsating hum, an enormous Light Realm enveloped an area of half a mile, illuminating everything and flushing out the two stealthy assassins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now revealed, they flanked him, standing only 150 feet away, clearly ready to mount a surprise attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately for them, in Osborne's Realm, he was a god. As long as his Realm held, their plans for stealth were nothing more than a joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They realized this, too, but instead of retreating, they erupted with terrifying speed, closing the distance in the blink of an eye, daggers glinting in their hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their voices blended in a hellish harmony as they coordinated perfectly, blocking all avenues of escape. Four daggers lunged toward his vital points&mdash;his heart, his throat&mdash;all aimed to end him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the true power of Class S warriors surged forth, fully unleashed and ready to bring destruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's martial art aura, formidable as it was, couldn't completely repel the vicious </span><span>assault aimed at him. He understood that if he got hit, it wouldn't just be a mere scrape&mdash;it'd likely leave him seriously injured, if not dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold gravity settled over him as he felt the imminent danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck off!" Osborne bellowed, his voice echoing with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Channeling the power within his Divine Bone, he thrust his right leg forward with a ferocious kick, sending the Class S assassin on his left crashing away, the sound of shattering bones ringing out like a sickening chorus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he dealt with one threat, the other moved in&mdash;striking hard and fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A divine artifact dagger sliced straight through Osborne's martial art aura, plunging deep into his flesh and aiming directly for his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Satan's Eye pulsed violently, screaming warnings of impending doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, even in the face of such raw peril, Osborne remained composed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sudden, powerful motion, he shot out his hand and seized the assassin's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer force of his grip bulged veins against the skin as he effectively halted the assassin's advance, the look of shock on the assassin's face unmistakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a Class S warrior caught helplessly in Osborne's grasp. No amount of effort could budge his arm a single inch, even with the dagger already piercing Osborne's flesh&mdash;barely half an inch away from his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wouldn't move any further!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of my way!" Osborne roared, his rage boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He unleashed another brutal kick, propelling the assassin backward with such force that the impact left the villain gasping for breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you think you could kill me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You haven't earned that right yet!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
