  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's voice thundered through the air. "Osborne! Are you looking for a death wish?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really think that just because you've broken into Class S, you can take me on? Since you've shown up, I might as well eliminate you once and for all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained silent, his head bowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surge of power from Gerardo's fusion with two divine remains had pushed him back, and for the first time since the battle began, he felt a flicker of calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne understood that if he let his desire for revenge cloud his judgment and acted recklessly, he wouldn't just fail to kill Gerardo. He might end up being killed himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, there was still a top-tier Class S warrior lurking nearby, waiting to make his move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Osborne gradually regained his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fury and murderous intent still roiled within him, but he buried it deep, refusing to let it dictate his actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lifted his gaze, his blood-red eyes locking onto Gerardo's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill me? Then come at me! Today, only one of us will walk away alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo scoffed, a cold smirk spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, it'll definitely be you who dies! I have to hand it to you&mdash;ever since you broke into Class S, you've become terrifyingly strong! Your physical strength must have hit a thousand, right? That's practically a ticket to the god's leagues!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you? You just broke into Class S, and your strength is already at a thousand! I'd say a big part of that is thanks to me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've literally created a monster!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armstrong, standing a short distance away, was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what? Is Osborne's physical strength at a thousand?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you serious? You've got to be kidding me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The top Class S warriors usually range from 100 to 200. You're telling me he's hit a thousand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo shot Armstrong an incredulous look. "You really are out of your depth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's a true monster, one I forged with my own hands!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned his full attention back to Osborne, a mocking grin plastered on his face. "So what if your physical strength is a thousand?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Physical power doesn't equate to absolute strength! Even if you're at a thousand, taking you down won't be a problem for me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After merging with two divine remains, my physical strength is not far behind yours, and in every other aspect, I'm leagues ahead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's disdainful gaze lingered on Osborne, as if he were looking at a mere insect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? You seem pretty confident," Osborne replied, his tone calm but icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To most, physical strength was just one piece of the puzzle; true power came from mastery over various aspects&mdash;the type of powers, the level of Realm, energy control, martial art techniques, and overall skill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Osborne, it was a different story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His physical strength directly enhanced his overall power, thanks to the fusion of his soul of powers and body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strong body meant strong power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body was the very fountain of his power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for energy control and advanced martial art skills? Osborne had learned from Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Gerardo had decades more experience, Osborne didn't believe he'd be outmatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo declared, puffing out his chest, "Of course, I'm confident!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're smart, you'll come quietly with me and finish what we started. Embrace your role as my servant, and you might just keep your life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, today's the day you kick the bucket!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle. "Enough with the chatter. Let's get to it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you, only one of us is walking away from this! Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce shout, Osborne lunged forward, unleashing a terrifying surge of power that propelled him right in front of Gerardo. He swung a powerful kick aimed squarely at Gerardo's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo snorted disdainfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're looking for death, I'll gladly oblige! Petrify!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A blinding light erupted from Gerardo's eyes. After merging with the corpse of Goddess Medusa, he gained the ability to petrify his opponents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last time he had captured Osborne so easily was thanks to this very power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that was then, and this was now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was a different beast entirely. His strength had skyrocketed. He was no longer the man with a mere 9 in physical power; now, he was a force to be reckoned with at 1100!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hundredfold increase!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And to top it off, Osborne had awakened Medusa's Gaze himself, mastering the petrification power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Does Gerardo think he can turn me to stone? Dream on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pressed forward, his movements fluid and relentless. He didn't even bother to use his martial art aura for defense. The petrifying light washed over him but had no effect whatsoever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With all his might, Osborne's kick landed squarely on Gerardo's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's eyes widened in shock as he scrambled to defend himself, but it was too late. He had lost the initiative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact sent shockwaves through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the fusion of two divine remains, Gerardo couldn't withstand the sheer force of Osborne's attack. Blood spewed from his mouth as he was sent flying backward, crashing into the ground with a thud.</span></p><div class="pagination">
