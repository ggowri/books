  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Osborne finished speaking, everyone exchanged glances, a mix of anticipation and concern swirling among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it the lightning elemental essence?" Anastasia asked, her brow furrowed in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, his eyes sparkling with excitement. "You all keep chatting. I'm going to break through!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group stood in stunned silence, watching as he vanished in an instant, returning to his secluded training spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, Zoe, and the others decided not to leave. They all knew how intense Osborne's breakthroughs could be, and it was better to stick around than risk being jolted awake again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If his lightning elemental essence hits Level Nine, will he get a Divine Ascendance Technique too?" Bryce murmured, glancing at Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia, didn't your lightning elemental essence break through to Level Nine? Did you not gain a Divine Ascendance Technique? It should be stronger than his, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia shook her head. "I've told you before Osborne is different from us! Sure, my talent in Thunder Power might seem stronger, but that doesn't mean my lightning elemental essence is on the same level as his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne's elemental essence operates on an entirely different plane! His Thunder Power talent may not match mine, but the sheer power of his lightning is something else entirely! Plus, he can unleash Thunder Power at a speed that's lightyears ahead of mine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's an anomaly! I don't know how he does it, but he's just incredible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Admiration shimmered in Anastasia's eyes as she spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What she didn't realize was that Osborne's uniqueness stemmed from the fact that his elemental essence had fully merged with his body long before he ascended to godhood, thanks to Isa's guidance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His elemental essence was essentially a part of his Divine Body, which had already reached the pinnacle of Level Ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This formidable Divine Body endowed Osborne's elemental essence with extraordinary power, even causing it to undergo a transformation. Not only did it enhance his elemental essence, but it also allowed him to execute various techniques at a speed that far surpassed anyone else's&mdash;a distinct advantage that no one else could match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with Anastasia's superior talent in Thunder Power, she couldn't hold a candle to Osborne's exceptional abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With both of them at Level Nine in elemental essence, Osborne's strength was simply on another level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Anastasia's lightning elemental essence had indeed crossed into Level Nine some time ago, but she hadn't gained a Divine Ascendance Technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, she had acquired several powerful lightning-based techniques, though they still fell short of the Divine Ascendance level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia declared, confidence radiating from her, "But I feel like I'm on the verge of grasping a Divine Ascendance Technique myself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that my lightning elemental essence has hit Level Nine, my control over lightning has reached a new height, and my understanding has deepened as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can sense it won't be long before I unlock my very own Divine Ascendance Technique! I actually hope Osborne's breakthrough leads to him mastering a lightning-based Divine Ascendance Technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I can observe how he wields it, it might just spark the inspiration I need to accelerate my own mastery!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she finished, the others looked at her with expressions of envy and admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's fantastic! You're on the path to understanding a Divine Ascendance Technique! With your talent, Anastasia, I have no doubt you'll succeed&mdash;and it won't take long!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like we all need to step up our game!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At the very least, we should aim to get our elemental essences to Level Nine as soon as possible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determination flickered in their eyes as they shared their thoughts, each one feeling the weight of their ambitions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia nodded thoughtfully. "I feel like reaching Level Nine in our elemental essences is the key to grasping a Divine Ascendance Technique ahead of time. As long as your elemental essence hits Level Nine and you have enough insight, even if you're not a Supernal Deity King, you could still unlock a Divine Ascendance Technique!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That would give you a fighting chance against one, rather than being completely defenseless... So, let's all push ourselves!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once Osborne's lightning elemental essence breaks through to Level Nine, he won't need to rely on the blue Miracle Elixir for a while anymore. Then everyone can freely use it to elevate their elemental essences. I'm sure we'll all hit that breakthrough soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group nodded in agreement, each feeling a newfound confidence swell within them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for saving the blue Miracle Elixirs for Osborne, they probably would have achieved Level Nine in their elemental essences by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mere thought of potentially gaining a Divine Ascendance Technique in the near future filled them with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they continued chatting, the anticipation in the air thickened. Suddenly, Osborne's lightning elemental essence surged, breaking through at long last!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hope Haven quaked violently once again, a familiar tremor that now elicited nothing more than calm acceptance and a hint of eagerness from the onlookers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were brimming with anticipation, eager to witness Osborne unleash a brand new lightning-based Divine Ascendance Technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Osborne did not disappoint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst the cataclysmic energy of his breakthrough, a fearsome bolt of black lightning suddenly materialized in the heavens above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This colossal bolt twisted and flickered ominously, crashing down but not vanishing immediately. Instead, it hung suspended in the air like a massive electric serpent connecting the sky to the ground, writhing wildly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anything that came into contact with this electric serpent would be instantly obliterated, reduced to nothing in the blink of an eye.</span></p><div class="pagination">
