  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s face turned pale, and he quickened his pace towards the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But in the next moment, Ophelia called out to Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Ophelia shouted, her face dark with anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She looked at the woman speaking&mdash;a drop-dead gorgeous beauty in her twenties with striking features, a full chest, and killer curves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That woman was Ophelia&rsquo;s cousin, Penelope Caldwell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ophelia, Justin just texted me. The bombs on Osborne are fake! Justin saw that loser sneaking into a junk shop,&rdquo; Penelope quickly said. &ldquo;He made those fake bombs with scrap materials from that shop. That bastard tried to scare us with fake bombs for money!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia&rsquo;s face twisted with shock and rage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She glared at Osborne, gritting her teeth. &ldquo;Osborne, you&rsquo;re asking for trouble. You dared to use fake bombs to scare me? To think you almost got away with it.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, she ordered her bodyguards to act. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Caldwell family was furious, glaring at Osborne like they wanted to tear him apart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;This bastard almost swindled twenty million from us!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;He deserves to die!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Kill him! Make him disappear forever!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They had been fearful of the bombs moments ago. Now, they all wanted Osborne dead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne took a deep breath, forcing himself to stay calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As the bodyguards closed in on him, he suddenly burst into laughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Hahahaha!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo; Ophelia frowned, puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone was puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;This bastard dares to laugh? Justin Caldwell found out his secret, and he still has the nerve to smile?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Is he not afraid of death?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Without the bomb threat, he&rsquo;s not leaving here alive. He must die today!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ignoring their words, Osborne sneered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m laughing at how stupid you are.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You loser, what did you say?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Osborne, how dare you do such a thing? We may have been married, but don&rsquo;t think I won&rsquo;t kill you,&rdquo; Ophelia spat angrily. &ldquo;Idiot!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne felt Ophelia&rsquo;s murderous intent, but he remained calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Justin claims my bombs are fake. If you believe him and attack me, I&rsquo;ll blow us all to pieces without hesitation. If you die, Justin gains the most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll take your place as the new heir of the Caldwell family, controlling its billions.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia&rsquo;s face changed instantly at Osborne&rsquo;s words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her beautiful features were now filled with doubt and suspicion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Was Justin lying to her?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Were Osborne&rsquo;s explosives real? Was Justin planning to use Osborne to kill her and take her place?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It seemed&hellip;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Very possible!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Caldwell family members were also filled with doubt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Only Penelope didn&rsquo;t buy Osborne&rsquo;s story.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing Ophelia waver, she quickly said, &ldquo;Justin wouldn&rsquo;t do that. The bombs must be fake. He wouldn&rsquo;t risk my life&mdash;I&rsquo;m his sister.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia&rsquo;s face darkened with fury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Osborne, you have one minute to prove it, or I&rsquo;ll kill you.&rdquo;</p><div class="pagination">
