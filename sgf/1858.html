  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xanto didn't mistake Osborne for Theodore, one of the Seven Young Deity Kings of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intel he had indicated that the real Theodore specialized in dark power and spatial power, with a high mastery of elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, the Theodore standing before him wielded Thunder Power and was adept in soul power, having easily defeated Kurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Xanto, mastering two elemental powers to such a high degree was already a remarkable feat. The notion that anyone could master four different elemental powers at a high level seemed utterly unfathomable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, he never connected the dots that this Theodore was indeed the same as the one from the Seven Young Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on lately? It feels like our Human Community is experiencing a surge of super talents!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty years ago, there was Isa and those three remarkable girls he brought along... Now we have the Seven Young Deity Kings and this 'Theodore' popping up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is this what the esteemed God of Light meant when she spoke of a surge of genius before a great calamity strikes?" Xanto pondered, shaking his head to dispel the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Astral Wolf Peak, huh? Maybe I should check it out! This Theodore thinks he can just kidnap Kurt and extort the Baxter family? He's got another thing coming! I know Trevor well enough. He won't let this slide! If the opportunity arises, I'll make sure to rescue Theodore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Xanto settled into a meditative position, letting the matter drift from his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne was nearing Hudson Valley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had successfully captured Kurt, he hadn't forgotten about the military maps the Hudson family possessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were in a tough spot lately, having suffered significant losses on the battlefield, even running low on Celestial Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hoped to negotiate the purchase of a military map from them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hudson family also had a Supernal Deity King&mdash;someone stronger than Trevor. Osborne had caught the attention of this Ascension Two Supernal Deity King during his previous surveillance, so he knew he couldn't sneak in undetected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Hudson family mistook him for an enemy, it would spell trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne decided to approach them through the proper channels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He arrived at the entrance of the Hudson family's estate, where a vigilant warrior stood guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warrior narrowed his eyes at Osborne and asked, "Who are you? What brings you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly cupped his hands in greeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, I'm Theodore, a friend of Tristan. I'd like to speak with the higher-ups of the Hudson family about a few matters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warrior paused, looking thoughtful. "Theodore... I feel like I've heard that name before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned slightly before continuing, "Since you're a friend of Tristan's, please wait here. I'll contact him to confirm your identity. However, I can't guarantee that the higher-ups will want to see you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the warrior activated his wrist terminal to reach out to Tristan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained silent, patiently waiting for a response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the heart of the Hudson Valley, inside a dimly lit villa, Tristan was overwhelmed with anguish, his hands gripping his head in despair. He gazed at his father, Seth Hudson, who lay frail and pale on the bed, life slipping away from him like grains of sand through an hourglass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan's voice cracked as he shouted, tears streaming down his face, "Dad! Why? Why did you do this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I went through hell and high water, and with a stroke of luck, I finally got my hands on a white Miracle Elixir! Why wouldn't you use it? Why give it away to someone else?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about you? Are you just going to wait here and die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart was breaking, the weight of his father's decision crushing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After securing the white Miracle Elixir at the auction, Tristan rushed back to the Hudson family's estate with a sense of urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately presented the elixir to Seth, hoping it would hasten his recovery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Seth, all smiles as he accepted it, promptly contacted the family elders and handed the precious elixir over to someone else, much to Tristan's disbelief and dismay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seth, barely able to meet his son's furious gaze, sighed deeply, a look of regret etched across his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tristan, don't blame me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Virgil&mdash;he needs the white Miracle Elixir more than I do! I'm old. My achievements have peaked at the Deity King level. But Virgil... he's the brightest talent of our younger generation, our heir!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He can't just die like this! If he goes, what happens to the future of the Hudson family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tristan, forgive me for taking matters into my own hands!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can accept my fate, but Virgil can't! This is for the good of the entire Hudson family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Seth spoke, Tristan felt a wave of disbelief wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears blurred his vision, and he finally let the dam break, his voice trembling with emotion. "But I don't want you to die! Virgil is important to the Hudson family, yes, but you're important to me, too! You're my father! I can't bear the thought of losing you!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
