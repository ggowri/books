  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter paced back and forth, deep in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The decision to rescue Lachlan was fraught with both potential benefits and significant risks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On one hand, saving him could come with serious drawbacks. Lachlan had already made enemies of several powerful factions, and if the Swift family intervened, their anger would surely shift toward the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was especially true for Fabian of the Wild Bull Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Walter had no fear of Fabian and Walter was confident he could handle Fabian with relative ease, he recognized the gravity of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian was still a Deity Overlord, and the Swift family had only one member capable of confronting him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they provoked Fabian, he could make their lives a living nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter couldn't afford to spend his days worrying about Fabian's wrath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, he leaned toward abandoning Lachlan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the younger generation of the Swift family was more than capable without him. If Lachlan died, it wouldn't be a huge loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, there was a tempting upside to consider.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan had managed to spend 120 million Essence Crystals at the slave market, which suggested he might have even more wealth hidden away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If those crystals came from an ancient god's treasure vault, saving him could lead the Swift family to that treasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, there was also the possibility that Lachlan had already spent every last crystal, in which case rescuing him would be a colossal mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what's it going to be?" Walter mused to himself, glancing at Calvin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calvin, you're about to become the new head of the Swift family. What do you think? Should we go after Lachlan? He is, after all, your nephew."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, I don't think we should intervene! We've worked tirelessly to establish ourselves in Wild Flame City. We've finally become the top force in the Human Community here. If we step in to save Lachlan, we risk angering other factions, and they'll come after us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All our hard work could go down the drain! Even if Lachlan does have access to some ancient god's vault, rescuing him could do more harm than good. Do you really think those other factions would let the Swift family keep all that treasure for ourselves?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, we've already publicly severed ties with him. If we go back on that now, it'll make us look untrustworthy and damage our family's reputation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I say we let him be!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter sighed, acknowledging the wisdom in his son's words. "You make a solid point. We'll go with your plan. But while we can't save him, we can certainly claim what's ours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A menacing glint flashed in Walter's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He added, "He spent 120 million on those slaves, and they should belong to the Swift family! You need to keep an eye on things over there. If Fabian ends up killing Lachlan, you'll announce that Lachlan stole our Essence Crystals to buy those slaves. If the crystals belong to us, then so do the slaves. We need to bring them back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smile spread across Calvin's face as he nodded, ready to execute their plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, you think of everything! Those slaves are top-tier, prime for the auction. Bringing them back will significantly boost the Swift family's strength. I'll get a team together right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Calvin prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter nodded. "If the opportunity arises, try to bring back Lachlan's body. No matter what, he's my grandson and your nephew."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin replied with a determined nod, "I'll do my best, Dad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Fabian leaves behind anything resembling a body, I'll make sure to bring him back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that commitment, Calvin headed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, he arrived at the slave market with a group of Swift family warriors in tow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Fabian spotted Calvin, his expression darkened. He recognized Calvin well; after all, he was the chiliarch of the Wild Flame Army and at the peak of the Celestial Deity realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not too long ago, when Fabian was still a Celestial Deity himself, they had crossed paths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In those days, Calvin was not his equal in battle, yet his inability to outpace Calvin's swift maneuvers rendered him incapable of securing victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as a newly minted Deity Overlord, Fabian felt confident he could handle Calvin with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a menacing smile, he challenged. "Calvin, what brings you and your crew here? Trying to rescue that wretched brat, are you? I seem to recall that the Swift family just announced your split from him and kicked him out not long ago. Are you backing down from that stance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin furrowed his brow, replying calmly, "Fabian, we're certainly not backing down, nor do we have any intention of rescuing him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Right now, he has nothing to do with the Swift family. However, we've just discovered he's been pilfering from the Swift family vault, stealing a significant amount of our Essence Crystals..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
