  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Time passed slowly, and before he knew it, Osborne had reached the late stage of Transcendent Deity by the next day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By the fourth day, he had broken through to the peak of Transcendent Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The speed of the Infinite Devouring Eyes exceeded his expectations; he had thought it would take at least five days to reach this level, but it only took four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne didn't feel overly excited. After all, this was just a minor elevation in his realm, and it didn't bring about a transformative change in his strength. Yes, he was stronger, but not by a significant margin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The real leap would come only when he broke through to Celestial Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The reason for his tempered excitement was that despite four days of intense cultivation, his space elemental essence still hadn't reached Level Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The leap from the peak of Level Six to Level Seven was a massive hurdle, and the difficulty was proving to be greater than Osborne had anticipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Several times, he nearly gave in to the temptation of using the core energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he held firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If, under the enlivening influence of dozens of times the enlightenment, he still couldn't break through the space elemental essence to Level Seven and had to resort to the core energy of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, Osborne himself wouldn't be able to accept it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't believe that I can't break through without the core energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity!" he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over the four days, he had gone from needing Riley to wake him every ten minutes to only requiring him to check in every six hours. This change allowed Osborne to cultivate without worrying about falling into illusions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His soul power was indeed formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In a place that could enhance comprehension dozens of times, anyone else would probably find their mental strength crumbling within minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne managed to maintain his clarity for six hours before any illusions began to creep in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even then, he could sense the onset and wake himself up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Overall, the pressure of cultivating here was manageable for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Through Riley, he had also learned about Diana's progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On her first day of cultivation, she had already reached the peak of Celestial Deity and was now using Ultimate Essence Crystals to push toward the Deity Overlord realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her speed was astonishing, even to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had even made a special trip back to leave her a hundred Ultimate Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In just four days, she had consumed at least 50 of them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was an incredible amount of energy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even someone like Riley, a mid-stage Deity Overlord warrior, could only absorb one Ultimate Essence Crystal's worth of energy in a day. Yet Diana had managed to absorb the equivalent of fifty in just over four days!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her speed of absorption was more than ten times that of Riley, a fact that completely took Osborne by surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the aid of so many Ultimate Essence Crystals, Diana was rapidly closing in on the Deity Overlord realm, leaving Riley and the others astounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can't believe it; she's a super genius!" Osborne murmured to himself before returning to his own cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Riley and the others protecting Diana, she was in good hands. If anything urgent came up, Riley would reach out to him immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When will I finally break through?" Osborne felt a bit helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His understanding of spatial power had improved tremendously over the past four days, yet he still hadn't made the leap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Level Seven elemental essence truly is the domain of the Deity Kings! Breaking through is incredibly tough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he pondered this, he suddenly felt a violent shift in his space elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Surprise lit up his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's finally starting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the fifth day of his cultivation, Osborne finally sensed a significant transformation in his space elemental essence, one that marked a true progression towards Level Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This metamorphosis was more intense and profound than any he had experienced before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Almost immediately, he felt the transformation ripple through his body, accompanied by excruciating pain that caused uncontrollable spasms. Cracks began to form on the surface of his skin, and blood surged forth, streaming down in crimson streaks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could hardly believe it&mdash;his body felt as though it were on the verge of collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What the hell is happening?" he gasped, shock washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one had warned him that breaking through to Level Seven would exert such a tremendous strain on his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Could it be because, with Isa's help long ago, I've fused my elemental essence with my physical form?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>My Divine Body is undeniably at Level Nine. How could my body not withstand such a transition when the space elemental essence is merely evolving to Level Seven?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Is it due to my low realm? My Divine Body might be high in level, but its strength clearly hasn't caught up because of my lower realm. There's still a significant gap compared to a Deity King warrior's Level Seven Divine Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What do I do now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sweat poured down Osborne's forehead, and a wave of panic washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If this continued, he feared his Divine Body would soon shatter completely.</span></p><div class="pagination">
