  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the God of Star and Divine Shadow were still locked in a fierce battle with the two remaining Transcendent Deities of the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within a mere handful of breaths, the two had gained the upper hand. However, dispatching their opponents quickly was proving to be quite the challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Transcendent Deity warriors had a remarkable ability to survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though their strength fell short compared to the likes of God of Star and Divine Shadow, with a bit of caution&mdash;avoiding attacks that could be lethal&mdash;they could hold their ground for a significant amount of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon's swift demise came not from a lack of skill but rather his failure to evade Osborne's deadly strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That said, Osborne's prowess did not necessarily eclipse the God of Star and Divine Shadow. It was more accurate to say that Osborne's methods were uniquely lethal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His manipulation of time and space was beyond Eamon's comprehension, allowing him to launch unchecked assaults. Coupled with the razor-sharp lethality of the Goddess of Grain's scythe, it was no wonder Eamon fell in a single blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a contest of divine power and raw strength, Osborne was still classified as an Intermediate Deity&mdash;he didn't quite stack up against the God of Star and Divine Shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a friendly spar, he might not even be a match for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in a battle where the stakes were life and death, the tide turned; the two of them combined wouldn't stand a chance against Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The range of techniques at Osborne's disposal was staggering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could confront challenges head-on, utilize stealth for ambushes, manipulate time to tilt the odds in his favor, and even boast a form of immortality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his own eyes, Osborne felt almost too powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless he faced someone with vastly superior strength who could easily wound or kill him, battling Osborne was a dangerous game&mdash;one where even the slightest oversight could lead to their demise at his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Took Isa, for instance. No matter how many bizarre tricks Osborne had up his sleeve, one strong kick from her, and he'd be left coughing up blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or Ophelia, whose own methods were even more perplexing; during the time she controlled, Osborne wouldn't even get close enough to touch her, let alone defeat her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd simply find himself toying with the whims of her power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beyond these exceptional cases, Osborne felt invincible against anyone else who couldn't completely overpower him. If he couldn't win straight up, Osborne could always strike from the shadows. If that didn't work, he could escape, and if escape wasn't possible, he could always resurrect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, he was too strong for his own good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon, despite being a Transcendent Deity warrior, had met a just end at Osborne's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he returned a thousand times, the result would be the same&mdash;death without a chance to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having absorbed the blood energy left in the wake of Eamon's demise, Osborne turned his attention to the raging battlefield of God of Star and Divine Shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chose not to interfere; he could see they had the upper hand, and it was only a matter of time before they triumphed over their opponents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he had drained all the blood energy from the battlefield, he transmitted it via the roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to the members of Blood Demon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, the Deschanel Clan had deployed three Transcendent Deities and seventeen Superior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, aside from the two remaining Transcendent Deities, all others had fallen, leaving behind a rich pool of blood energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne estimated that such a tremendous amount of blood energy could empower a portion of the Blood Demon Vanguard to successfully break into the ranks of Intermediate Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, this blood energy was being transmitted through the roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. In the process, the Lotus refined the energy into something far </span><span>more potent and pure</span><span>, allowing the members of the Blood Demon to reap greater benefits and ascend to higher realms with greater ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured to himself, "The blood energy of a Superior Deity should be enough for ten Blood Demon members to break through to Intermediate Deity! And the blood energy of a Transcendent Deity... that would be enough for a hundred of them to reach Intermediate Deity status!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze lingered on the two surviving members of the Deschanel Clan, who were both Transcendent Deities, barely clinging to life. A cruel smile appeared on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "If I finish them off, their blood energy would be enough to push nearly one-tenth of our members&mdash;around 470 of them&mdash;to the level of Intermediate Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that kind of power, we could steamroll the Deschanel Clan, the League of Divine Descent, and maybe even the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yeah, slaughtering them and harvesting their blood energy is definitely the fastest way to boost the strength of our clan. Even though the Blood Demon members are already extraordinary, having forged Level Three Divine Bodies, their self-cultivation speed is still nothing compared to what they gain through this blood energy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of hesitation crossed his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should I turn Grandpa, Anastasia, Bryce, and the rest of the Augustine family into Blood Clan members too? Not only would they become stronger, but they'd also gain the immortality granted by the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after a moment's thought, Osborne shook his head, dismissing the idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Blood Demon creations are powerful, no doubt, but their potential is capped. I can't afford to impose such limits on my own family. Grandpa, Anastasia&mdash;they have no ceiling. As for the immortality..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
