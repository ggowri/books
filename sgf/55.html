  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna intercepted the lightning with her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With a sudden crack, as the lightning struck, a thick earthen wall materialized in front of her, miraculously blocking its path.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne swallowed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This elderly woman is also a metahuman. Her strength surpasses Milo&rsquo;s by far</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> Is her superpower to control the earth?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was extremely shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;L-Let go of me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that moment, a shy voice suddenly sounded from Osborne&rsquo;s arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He glanced down and discovered Clarissa staring at him with her captivating eyes. She, like a startled bird, was held tightly in his arms, cheeks flushed red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He coughed and quickly released her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He said solemnly, &ldquo;Ms. Radcliffe, we need to leave this place immediately and find somewhere to hide. You&rsquo;re being attacked by more than one person, and gunmen are closing in.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As soon as Osborne finished speaking, gunshots rang out in the distance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His face darkened. He instantly picked up Clarissa and ducked behind the cover.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The next moment, countless bullets hit the cover, kicking up clouds of dust. The barrage was so dense that Osborne couldn&rsquo;t lift his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Fortunately, his Satan&rsquo;s Eye could see through the cover and into the distance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Two hundred yards away, dozens of fully armed, masked assailants in black were advancing rapidly, each wielding an automatic rifle and firing as they approached.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul and the other bodyguards with Clarissa were forced to duck behind cover, returning fire cautiously and not daring to lift their heads.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If this persisted, within half a minute at most, dozens of killers would reach them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Damn it,&rdquo; Osborne couldn&rsquo;t help but curse under his breath. He should have expected this long ago. How could the test of heirship that the Godfather gave to his heir be devoid of danger?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was simply unrealistic to complete the test effortlessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now, his top priority was ensuring Clarissa&rsquo;s safety. Her death would signify his failure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">We can&rsquo;t confront them directly</span><span style="font-style: italic;">,</span> he thought. <span style="font-style: italic;">Our only option is to fight while falling back</span><span style="font-style: italic;">. </span><span style="font-style: italic;">I need weapons!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne made up his mind and looked suddenly into the distance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There lay one of Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguards, struck by lightning and unconscious. His riot shield was discarded beside him, and there was a pistol in his holster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne measured the distance, gritted his teeth, and prepared to dash out from cover. Though highly perilous, with the riot shield and pistol, he could mount a defense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;W-What are you going to do?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When he was about to rush out, Clarissa abruptly grabbed his arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was stunned and quickly explained, &ldquo;I need weapons and a riot shield. Without them, I can&rsquo;t fight back or ensure your safety.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s too dangerous. Bullets are flying everywhere out there,&rdquo; Clarissa said, her concern evident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne shook his head and smiled, &ldquo;I have to go. Otherwise, you will die.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, he pounced out swiftly like a cheetah.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He activated his Satan&rsquo;s Eye to its utmost, calculating the position and speed of every incoming bullet, evading them with precision.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Yet, even so, he still couldn&rsquo;t avoid the bullets completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The ceaseless bullets were like raindrops, impossible to dodge entirely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Unexpectedly, Osborne felt a pain in his left shoulder, and blood spurted out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Fortunately, it was not a vital part. Enduring the pain, he hurriedly picked up the riot shield and positioned it in front of himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The next moment, endless bullets hit the riot shield with bangs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was grateful for the top-notch riot shields provided by the Radcliffe family for their bodyguards, crafted by the Draco Group, which could easily withstand even dense rifle bullets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He promptly pulled out the pistol from the unconscious bodyguard&rsquo;s waist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Now, it&rsquo;s my turn to fight back.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne braced the riot shield with his injured left hand and fired fiercely with his right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The downpour limited visibility for all but him. With Satan&rsquo;s Eye, he effortlessly pinpointed the location of every enemy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With each shot he fired, an enemy fell a hundred yards away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">By the time he had emptied the last of the ten bullets in his magazine, ten enemies lay knocked down in the distance, and the dense gunfire abruptly thinned out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He seized the opportunity and returned to Clarissa&rsquo;s side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ms. Radcliffe, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne helped Clarissa up and covered her with the riot shield, ready to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, a tall and robust figure obstructed their path.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was Paul.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne subdued the enemy&rsquo;s gunfire, prompting Paul to emerge from cover. Instead of launching an immediate counterattack, he swiftly rushed to Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Hey, let go of Ms. Radcliffe! I am the captain of her bodyguards. From now on, I will take care of her.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, Paul pushed Osborne away violently.</p><div class="pagination">
