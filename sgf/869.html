  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The elders of the Augustine family's Wise Orders stared at Osborne, their expressions a mix of disbelief and contemplation.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The room was thick with tension, and it was Declan who finally broke the silence. "Osborne, you can't blame them. This is the Honor Quest Ceremony. While your strength is commendable, showcasing it in this event is no small feat."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled, a calm demeanor masking the storm beneath, "I completely understand.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Therefore, I've decided that I will personally cover the prizes for this Honor Quest Ceremony! A divine artifact and 500 billion in cash? Perfect! After all, I defeated Cuthbert at his own Honor Quest Ceremony and claimed a divine artifact and the cash prize."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His words hung in the air, and the room fell silent as realization dawned on the elders.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was indeed Axell, the one who had bested Cuthbert, earning a divine artifact and a staggering sum from the Williamson family.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, the way they regarded Osborne shifted.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since I'll be providing the rewards, there's no need for further discussion. Now, feel free to return to your own affairs," Osborne said, his tone dismissive yet composed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The elders exchanged glances, unsure of how to respond.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Honor Quest Ceremony was a request from Sebastian, and the rewards were originally meant to come from the Augustine family. Now that Osborne had taken it upon himself to shoulder the responsibility, what could they argue about?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before long, the room emptied, leaving only Declan, Bob, Caleb, and a few others like Vincent, Matthew, and Emma.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent's gaze was locked onto Osborne, his eyes burning with anger and jealousy, fists clenched tightly at his sides.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne met his stare with equal intensity.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Vincent, what are you still doing here? We, the core members of the Augustine family, have important matters to discuss. It wouldn't be appropriate for a regular clan member like you to linger."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent froze, caught off guard by the remark. "I'm one of the most talented young members of the Augustine family! If Emma can stay and Matthew can stay, why can't I? Mr. Declan Augustine didn't dismiss me, so who do you think you are?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smirked, a hint of arrogance in his demeanor. "Because I'm the first heir of the Augustine family! Emma is the second heir, and Matthew is the third. They have every right to be here."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And you? You're nothing!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With those words, Vincent's anger flared even more.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just a short while ago, he had been the top contender among the younger generation of the Augustine family, involved in every significant matter, while Matthew and Emma were often sidelined.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, Osborne was trying to kick him out.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before he could retort, Osborne continued, "By the way, do you remember our last duel? I defeated you with just one move. You seem to have forgotten our wager.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You lost, remember? From now on, you owe me a respectful salute!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, why haven't you shown me that respect yet?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's gaze was unyielding as he stared Vincent down.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent's face flushed with rage, his anger bubbling beneath the surface, but he felt powerless to act on it.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All he could do was glare at Osborne, his voice dripping with venom. "Osborne, don't get too cocky. Someone will take you down sooner or later!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, he turned on his heel, ready to storm out.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did I say you could leave?" Osborne stepped in front of him, blocking his path.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Vincent, if you hadn't come here to provoke me, I wouldn't have bothered with you. But since you did, you'd better show some respect before you go!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent's fury reached a boiling point. "What gives you the right? Are you planning to lay a hand on me?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne let out a cold laugh.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Declan frowned and spoke up, "Osborne, as the first heir of the Augustine family, you shouldn't stoop to Vincent's level. Let's just drop this, shall we? Give me some respect here."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Declan, Vincent's grandfather, held immense power, status, and influence as the senior elder of the main bloodline of the Augustine family.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent's arrogance within the family was largely backed by Declan's presence.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At Declan's words, Vincent's face lit up with a smug expression.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He sneered at Osborne, as if to say, "My grandfather is the senior elder Declan. With him here, how dare you lay a hand on me?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing this, Osborne chuckled.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ignoring Declan, he turned to Vincent and said calmly, "Since you're so reluctant, I'll just help you out!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Osborne slapped Vincent across the face.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent was taken aback and tried to dodge but suddenly felt a tremendous force bearing down on him, rendering him immobilized.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He could only watch helplessly as Osborne's palm made harsh contact with his cheek.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sound of the slap echoed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent was sent flying and landing in a heap before Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In that instant, Vincent's face not only bore a clear imprint of the slap but also a deep sense of humiliation.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne!" Declan roared, his voice filled with fury.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He hadn't expected Osborne to dare lay a hand on Vincent even after he had spoken up for his grandson. Not only had Osborne slapped Vincent, but he had also humiliated Vincent in such a manner.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent was his grandson!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Declan's anger boiled over, and he barked, "Osborne, you've gone too far! Attacking a member of our own clan, I'll teach you some manners!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Declan lunged forward, launching a fierce attack.</p><div class="pagination">
