  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Luckily, I still have a month to prepare!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne clenched his fists tightly. He was aware of his current strength, and he knew that if he were to hold the Honor Quest Ceremony now, it would definitely turn into a laughingstock. Even though he had confidence in his abilities, he didn't consider himself to be among the top warriors of the younger generation globally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The so-called younger generation referred to those under forty-five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, some were twenty years older than Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Take Emma, for example. She had already reached Class AAA at just twenty-five. Given another twenty years, her power would only grow stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, she would likely have broken through to Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And on a global scale, Emma's talent was far from the highest. There were certainly others with even more astonishing potential, like Osborne's mother, Vivienne, or Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, those of the younger generation who had already become Class S usually abstained from participating in the Honor Quest Ceremony due to pride. In the past two hundred years, not a single Class S Supreme Overlord had ever joined the challenges at an Honor Quest Ceremony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, the strongest opponents Osborne would face would be at most Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, he could declare right now that he wouldn't be able to complete Godfather's Seventh Inheritance Trial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Class AAA, huh?" Osborne muttered to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Even within Class AAA, the gap in strength can be enormous. For example, the Class AAA Evolved Humans from the Aberrants are considered the weakest of their class. Someone like Vincent, even though he's Class AAA, would be easily defeated by someone like Emma, who has just broken through to Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then there's Bryce, the pirate leader from Likreia Mountain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce is hailed as the closest to Class S among the younger generation. With the Trident of Poseidon in his hand, his combat power at sea can even rival a Class S Supreme Overlord, which is why he's called the 'Junior Supreme Overlord.'</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, while all these warriors have reached Class AAA, their actual strength varies greatly. I can now easily defeat the Evolved Humans of Class AAA from the Aberrants, but I'm still far from matching those Class AAA warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have a month left, and I must break through to Class AAA in that time. Only by reaching Class AAA will I have even a slight chance of perfectly clearing the Honor Quest Ceremony!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, both my power and martial arts need to break through. I must also find a way to quickly recover my stamina, or I won't last long in consecutive battles."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly pondered his next steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more he thought about it, the more pressure he felt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This task was indeed incredibly difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, intense discussions continued among the members of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost everyone believed that Godfather was making a mistake by holding an Honor Quest Ceremony for Osborne. They felt Osborne wasn't worthy and that his Honor Quest Ceremony would inevitably turn into a disgraceful spectacle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I still oppose this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dalton spoke up. "We all know that an Honor Quest Ceremony is not something to be taken lightly. If the challenger is defeated, we must reward them with a divine artifact and 500 billion dollars in wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine artifacts and 500 billion dollars are no small matters!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our Augustine family is wealthy, but we can't afford to waste it like this. If Osborne were strong enough and confident in achieving a twenty-win streak, or even thirty, then holding an Honor Quest Ceremony wouldn't be out of the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Osborne has only reached Class AA! If we hold the Honor Quest Ceremony, he might not even make it to ten wins. If he can't even achieve a ten-win streak, wouldn't this just be a disgraceful ceremony?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are we going to use a divine artifact and 500 billion dollars to host a disgraceful ceremony?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I disagree!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dalton was Owen's grandfather, and his words immediately gained support from many others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right, we disagree as well!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne is only twenty-five and has just reached Class AA. Even if Godfather sees potential in him and wants to hold an Honor Quest Ceremony for him, we should wait at least another ten years. In ten years, he might have a chance at a thirty-win streak, forty, or even fifty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now? He simply isn't qualified!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hosting an Honor Quest Ceremony for him is a joke. It would make more sense to host one for Emma or Vincent instead. At least they are Class AAA. If they push themselves, there's a good chance they could manage a ten-win streak, and at least it wouldn't turn into a disgraceful ceremony."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly, Osborne is only Class AA. If our Augustine family hosts an Honor Quest Ceremony for him, we will become the laughingstock. The world's superpowers will ridicule us. It's bad enough we chose a Class AA as an heir; now we're holding an Honor Quest Ceremony for him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'd be mocked by everyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I oppose this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I disagree!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elders of the Augustine family were visibly agitated, firmly expressing their opposition. Only Declan, Bob, and the Third Elder Caleb remained silent, quietly watching Wesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson wore a faint smile as he listened carefully to everyone's objections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When everyone had finished speaking, he finally raised his hand, signaling for silence.</span></p><div class="pagination">
