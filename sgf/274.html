  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Donna!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa exclaimed in shock, watching as Donna and Osborne were successively petrified by Medusa's strange power, her face full of horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She waved her hand fiercely to stimulate a large area of white Holy Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hoped that the light could save them, allowing them to recover from petrification.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before the light could fall, a black mist suddenly appeared, blocking the white light and preventing it from falling on Osborne and Donna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Venom Lord who made the move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom Lord grinned at Clarissa, "Your power is quite peculiar. You can bring even those on the brink of death back and even neutralize my toxins. Perhaps you really could neutralize Medusa's petrification.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But unfortunately, I won't let that happen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Clarissa clenched her fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom Lord shrugged, not answering, but stepped aside slightly, indicating that Medusa was his leader and she could answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa took a deep breath and looked at Medusa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that Medusa's eyes had the effect of petrification, but she was not afraid at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa was also looking at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Strangely, Medusa did not use her petrifying power. She just looked at her with a smile that was not quite a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should know who we are, right? We are from The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>," Medusa said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was not surprised, gritting her teeth. "Why do you want to kill me? As such a master, you should also be a senior even in The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>. I don't seem to have offended you, and I have never left </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>. Why do you want to kill me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa smiled faintly, "Why? I don't know. Perhaps only the great King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> knows it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But rest assured, this will be our last assassination attempt on you. Whether it's successful or not, the great King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> will no longer send anyone to kill you. After all, you are the </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span>. Even the great King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> does not wish to be tainted by your fate power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But unfortunately, there won't be a next time. You are doomed this time. No one can save you now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she looked at Venom Lord. "Venom Lord, kill her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom Lord's expression changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He complained, "Medusa, killing a </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span> might be backfired by the fate power, right? Why don't you kill her yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa said indifferently, "Because I am your leader, and my strength is more significant than yours! Do you think I brought you on this mission for no reason? But you don't have to worry too much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She has not fully grown yet. Her fate power is not strong enough. Killing her does not necessarily mean you will be backfired. But if you don't act, I will kill you immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Venom Lord looked helpless immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll do it, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Venom Lord stared at Clarissa. "It's such a pity that such a beautiful woman has to die like this. I really want to play with her before killing her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa said coldly, "You'd better give up this suicidal thought! You might not be backfired by killing her, but if you sleep with her, you will definitely be backfired by the fate power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even the spokesperson of the gods may not be able to withstand the backfire of fate power from sleeping with her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry up and kill her. Don't waste time. This is the territory of the Draco Group. We have to leave quickly, otherwise it will be dangerous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Venom Lord looked regretful. "Okay, I understand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, he sneered and waved his hand fiercely. Suddenly, a dense black fog turned into a terrifying skull, rushing towards Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My </span><span>Necrovenom</span><span>, corrode her body!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying skull was in front of Clarissa in the blink of an eye. Her body trembled slightly, but her eyes sparkled with cruel, killing intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was about to take action, another change occurred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The layers of rocks around Osborne suddenly collapsed, and Osborne was surrounded by a light blue Devil's Light, recovering from the petrified state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the black skull attacking Clarissa, he snorted coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Want to kill Clarissa? Unless you step over my corpse first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a blue Devil's Light shot out, hitting the black skull, instantly shattering it and disappearing without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Venom Lord was freaked greatly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! How did you recover?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa also looked at Osborne in surprise, her eyes full of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You actually recovered from my petrification? Impossible! No one below the Class A master can be unaffected by my petrification! You are definitely not a Class A metahuman master. How did you do it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa's face was full of curiosity at this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne also flashed a trace of fear in his eyes after hearing this. Medusa's petrification power was really terrifying. Even he was almost instantly petrified without any accident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne thought he was done for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa was definitely a much more terrifying master than Orion and Derek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne even suspected that she was a Class A power master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, with his current strength, how could he be petrified so easily?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, at this critical moment, he found a way to break the petrification.</span></p><div class="pagination">
