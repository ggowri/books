  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After placing the bet at the casino, Osborne returned to his residence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he returned to the courtyard, Osborne used Sacred Power to protect the entire yard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Primordial transformed into a small </span><span>treant</span><span> and appeared in front of Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Osborne, quickly take out that peculiar tooth and let me study it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since purchasing this peculiar tooth on Star Street, he still didn't know its origin. Osborne took out the tooth and handed it </span><span>to</span><span> Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial immediately began to study it carefully.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Don't disturb me for now, I need some time to study this. I feel somewhat familiar with this thing, but I can't recall it at the moment. Go try to make the Death Vine seed sprout. Death Vine can only germinate in pure death power; you can directly merge it into your Death's Stare!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded again. "Alright!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne ignored Primordial and took out the Death Vine seed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to Primordial, the Death Vine is a type of Primordial Creature, just like the World Tree, Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, and Warfare Ancient Tree, existing in the Chaotic World long before the cosmos was born.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although the power of the Death Vine is not as strong as the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity or the Warfare Ancient Tree, it is still very formidable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once grown, it can be an extremely powerful weapon, able to cast a Death coil, bind opponents, and even form a Death Vine Armor with extremely strong defense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, this is a rare treasure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Phantom Commerce Guild failed to make the Death Vine sprout because they used the wrong method. Generally, any Plant Clan creature exposed to death power will wither and decay quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the Death Vine is the exact opposite; it can only sprout in the purest scent of death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Phantom Commerce Guild tried various methods but never attempted using death power, so they naturally failed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took out the Death Vine seed and, following </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> instructions, directly invoked the power of Death's Stare. Intense death power instantly enveloped the Death Vine seed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's Death's Stare power comes from Emma.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emma's past life was known as the God of Death, who wielded this death power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, the death power in Osborne's Death's Stare is also extremely pure. However, since Osborne has mastered many techniques, he rarely needs to use Death's Stare.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "If the Death Vine is truly as powerful as Primordial claims, then merging it with Death's Stare will surely make it even stronger. Perhaps by then, Death's Stare can finally come in handy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he pondered, Osborne noticed the Death Vine seed undergoing drastic changes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He exclaimed in surprise, "It sprouted!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne watched as the Death Vine sprouted and quickly grew roots.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without hesitation, he pressed the seed onto Death's Stare. "Merge!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fusion of Death's Stare and Death Vine went smoothly without any issues. After all, the Death Vine's sprouting relied entirely on the power of Death's Stare.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the Death Vine vanished without a trace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Osborne's right eye, a faint shadow of a vine emerged deep within the pupil of Death's Stare. Upon closer inspection, the vine was entirely jet-black, continuously absorbing the power of Death's Stare and growing rapidly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this rate of absorption, under normal circumstances, the death power within Death's Stare would soon be depleted, requiring it to recover before it could be absorbed again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne's Chaotic Spiritual Root was overwhelmingly powerful, capable of restoring the death power of Death's Stare, providing an endless supply for the Death Vine to absorb freely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under such circumstances, the growth rate of the Death Vine was astonishing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "Right now, the Warfare Ancient Tree is absorbing my Sacred Power, and the Death Vine is devouring my scent of death. Fortunately, I have the Chaotic Spiritual Root, or I wouldn't be able to sustain their demands."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne pondered for a moment, then stood up, turning his gaze toward Primordial on the other side.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Primordial was still focused on studying that strange tooth, but unlike before, there was now a hint of joy in his expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne hurriedly asked, "Primordial, have you figured out what this is?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial nodded and responded with joy, "I'm now over 90% sure about the identity of this tooth. Osborne, you're really lucky. A seemingly useless tooth you casually picked up turns out to be an extremely rare treasure."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up upon hearing this and he asked, "What exactly is it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial replied, "This is a </span><span>Necrosnake</span><span> fang."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly searched his memory of the Heavenly Compendium of All Beings but found no records about the </span><span>Necrosnake</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked in confusion, "What kind of creature is the </span><span>Necrosnake</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial calmly explained, "The </span><span>Necrosnake</span><span> is a Primordial Creature. It was born in the chaos surrounding the World Tree, and that chaos wasn't limited to plant-based beings; later, a few animal-based beings also emerged."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, their numbers are very few. The </span><span>Necrosnake</span><span> is one of them. More precisely, the collapse and explosion of that Chaotic World, which gave birth to this cosmos, were due to the existence of the </span><span>Necrosnake</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It was the </span><span>Necrosnake</span><span> that bit through the boundary barrier of that Chaotic World."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And its fangs are considered the sharpest in the world, with almost nothing able to withstand its bite."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Additionally, the </span><span>Necrosnake's</span><span> venom is extremely terrifying. Even Primordial Creatures like the World Tree or the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity would suffer severe damage and struggle to recover if bitten by the </span><span>Necrosnake</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing </span><span>Primordial's</span><span> words, Osborne was shocked and gaped.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked in confusion, "The </span><span>Necrosnake</span><span> is really that powerful? A Primordial Creature? The sharpest substance?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial nodded in affirmation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He then added, "Unfortunately, this </span><span>Necrosnake</span><span> fang has lost most of its power, and its venom has almost completely dissipated. Otherwise, anyone who touched it would be instantly poisoned to death, or even just a glance could cause poisoning. However, it still holds significant value."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne felt a bit disappointed and quickly asked, "What can it be used for?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial replied calmly, "It's simple, fuse it into your Warfare Scythe. Then, your Warfare Scythe will become incredibly sturdy and sharp, capable of easily penetrating any defense. It can even effortlessly cut through others' Sacred Artifacts."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as you have enough strength to wield the Warfare Scythe, there will be nothing in this world that you cannot cut through."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Additionally, it can imbue your Warfare Scythe with venomous power. Anyone injured by your Warfare Scythe will see their strength greatly diminished, or might even die on the spot!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing this, Osborne's eyes gleamed brightly. "So, it can make the Warfare Scythe sharper, sturdier, and even more powerful?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial nodded again. "That's right. After fusing this </span><span>Necrosnake</span><span> Fang, the power of your Warfare Scythe will likely far surpass the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow. You're truly lucky to obtain such a treasure."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>Necrosnakes</span><span> have long been extinct. This fang is likely the only one in the cosmos!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
