One million and 50 thousand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pfft! One million and 50 thousand? Dream on! The Crimson </span><span>Ironhoof</span><span> Clan's Earwood family also fancies them&mdash;one million and 100 thousand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Spirit Turtle Clan's Ulysses family bids one million and 200 thousand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rainbow Viper Clan's Margery family bids one million and 300 thousand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One million and 400 thousand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The auction hall erupted into a frenzy as representatives from various factions fiercely competed for these twenty top-tier female slaves from the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their appeal lay not only in their beauty but also in their formidable strength&mdash;each boasting at least Intermediate Deity-level power.

As he listened to the rising bids and gazed at the twenty terrified, despairing Human Community females on stage, his face darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood all too well the fate awaiting these women if they fell into the wrong hands.</span></p><div class="pagination">
