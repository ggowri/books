  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truth serum quickly took effect on Xavier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne began to interrogate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me. Who asked you to attack the Augustine family's cruise ship?" He </span><span>said</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a person codenamed Blueblood," Xavier said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, "Tell me his identity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier said, "I don't know! But from the skull tattoo on his arm, I suspected he was from the Ghost Ship! But I didn't ask. I don't care who he is because he has given me a lot of money. As long as I have money, I dare to do anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can hide somewhere after finishing this job, after all," he added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His indifferent attitude agitated Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ryan was suddenly shocked and exclaimed, "Ghost ship?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at him in surprise. "Ryan, do you know it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan nodded with an extremely solemn face. "Yeah! The Ghost Ship has at least two or three hundred years of history, but they just appeared a few times near the coastline of Dampston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And every time they showed up, an ancient family in Dampston would be destroyed! Therefore, many ancient families in Dampston regard them as a curse!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as a ghost ship with the skull flag appears, all the ancient families in Dampston will become nervous, fearing that they will be the ones to be destroyed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ghost ship? Curse?" He sneered. "People just love this kind of spooky story. In my opinion, the Ghost Ship is most likely just a pirate organization good at hiding. There must be a big force behind it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Usually, they rob ships like ordinary pirates. They only take targeted actions when their financier </span><span>give</span><span> them orders," he added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Ryan opened his mouth but did not refute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fell into deep thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued to interrogate Xavier, hoping to find the person codenamed Blueblood through him, but Xavier knew nothing about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time, Blueblood came to him with tons of gold bars and the mission. Then, he or she disappeared immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xavier had no idea how to contact this mysterious pal at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned. "Are these all the clues? Blueblood? The Ghost ship? Although I got some information, there's no way to continue tracking it. Seemingly, I have to wait for that person to strike again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long interrogation, he made sure that he could gain no more useful information from Xavier. He immediately waved his hand and stirred up a wind blade, cutting Xavier into countless pieces amid his screams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne walked to the deepest part of this cave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was also a solid door there. According to Xavier, all the wealth of the Hydrophis Belcheri Organization was inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Opening the door, Osborne felt as if his eyes were blinded by the glitter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the center of a huge room, a pile of shining gold bars was placed there, with each of them weighing a standard one kilogram; there were at least ten tons of gold in this room worth over two billion dollars!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two billion dollars meant nothing to Osborne now, but it was the first time that Osborne had seen gold worth this considerable amount of money, and he couldn't help but be shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, he calmed down and collected all the gold into the Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan, who was outside the door, had no idea what was going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And even if he knew, he wouldn't say anything. The entire Hydrophis Belcheri Organization was destroyed by Osborne alone, and its treasure should belong to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go back to the Alisa Ship!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and Ryan walked out of the cave. It was very busy outside the cave. Yulissa and Nathan contacted the Augustine family by a satellite phone to send a helicopter to take those dozens of poor women back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, there was one person who still stood on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Kendra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne coming out, Kendra immediately trotted to him and carefully grabbed his sleeve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa also ran over and whispered, "This woman doesn't want to leave. She insists on staying here and waiting for you. I can't do anything about her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded and turned to look at Kendra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Why don't you leave? I told you that you are free, and you can go home now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra bit her lip and shook her head. "I can't leave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This sea is my home. I don't want to go to the shore! If someone captures me to threaten my brother, I'll be done," Kendra explained in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned after hearing that. "Your home is on the sea? Where is it? I'll tell someone to take you back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra blushed immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I, I don't know! I'm lost. I've never left home since I was a child. This time, I left home without telling anyone but got lost in a storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All I know is that my home is on an island, and there is a mountain on the island called Likreia Mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have always lived there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned when he heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa, Ryan, and Nathan had the same reaction as him, all staring blankly at Kendra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You live in Likreia Mountain?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you really the leader of the Likreia Mountain Pirates, Bryce's sister?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra bit her lip and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take me back, and my brother will definitely be grateful to you!" She </span><span>said</span><span>.</span></p><div class="pagination">
