  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes snapped open abruptly as he fully assimilated all the memories of his past life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among those recollections, what etched the deepest mark in his soul was neither the epic battles against Lord Malevolence on </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet nor the precious time he'd dedicated to nurturing Clarissa and Isa. Instead, it was the hundreds of years he'd shared with his humble mother in the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in his eyes, blurring his vision, and the most excruciating memory came rushing back like a tidal wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could vividly see his mother desperately beseeching his father, but the man remained deaf-eared, firmly believing that she was the mastermind behind the chaos and ultimately sentencing her to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time that heart-wrenching scene replayed in his mind, it was as if a sharp dagger </span><span>were</span><span> </span><span>stabbing at his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that very moment, all Osborne could do was stand there helplessly, watching as his mother met her tragic end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming pain threatened to engulf him completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let the tears stream down freely, his eyes fixed blankly on the empty space before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that direction lay the Racial Convergence Planet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the core of the Racial Convergence Planet was the Glorious Divine Kingdom, the very place where his past-life mother was laid to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom..." Osborne murmured, his voice quivering as fresh tears trickled down his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Isa, Clarissa, and the others stood rooted to the spot, completely stunned by the sight of Osborne with tears streaming down his cheeks. They were at a complete loss as to what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why is Osborne crying so bitterly just after integrating his past-life memories?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Isa reached out and tightly clasped Osborne's hand, her grip a clear sign of her anxiety. "Osborne, what's the matter? Did something go awry during the memory integration? I'm so sorry! It's our fault; we shouldn't have let you do this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, her eyes grew red-rimmed, and tears welled up in them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa, Emma, and Austin watched on, their own eyes glistening. The sight of Osborne in such distress was like a sharp pang in their hearts, and they quickly rushed forward to envelop him in a warm embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling their comforting warmth, Osborne finally snapped out of his daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep, steadying breath and then managed a faint smile. "Don't fret. I'm fine! It's just that some unforeseen memories from my past life caught me off guard for a moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those thoughts, he suppressed the guilt and pain that welled up at the thought of his mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was fully cognizant that no matter how much he yearned to, the past was immutable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mother had been executed, and more than a thousand years had slipped by since then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While a millennium might hold little significance for true warriors, the individuals who had bullied and humiliated him, those who had plotted against his mother, and those who had taken pleasure in his misery were probably still alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, all he could do was tuck those agonizing memories away deep in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne spoke once more, a smile reappearing on his face, "I'm okay now! So, that was my past life. How dull it was&mdash;all I did was train, and there was nothing else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head, then shifted his gaze to Clarissa, Emma, Austin, and Anita.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the memories now fully integrated, he felt an instant sense of familiarity and a closer bond with them, particularly Anita.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before integrating the memories, Anita had seemed like a senior, "God of Light" to him, but now he motioned for her to come closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Annie, you've been through a lot these years!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Anita stood stock-still, her eyes popping open in shock. Unable to contain her emotions any longer, tears started to pour down her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Master, you're finally back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, she rushed into Osborne's arms, her heart brimming with a mix of joy and relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A millennium had elapsed since the fateful battle against Lord Malevolence. Over that </span><span>long period, Clarissa, Emma, Austin, and even Ophelia had passed away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anita was the sole survivor, having remained by Osborne's side with unwavering loyalty, taking care of him through the endless years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been his most devoted attendant, the one who had accompanied him for the longest time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when Osborne entered the cycle of reincarnation, all his memories were wiped clean. Thanks to the Orb of Reincarnation, he crossed paths with Clarissa, Austin, Emma, and even Isa on Blue Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Anita, who had been safeguarding the West Zone of </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet to protect the Human Community, had become a complete stranger to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as Osborne retrieved the memories of his past life, he finally recognized her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he addressed her as "Annie", Anita could no longer hold back her tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a sigh. He let Anita hug him tightly and gently patted her on the back. "I'm truly sorry for everything you've endured."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, he got to his feet. His eyes suddenly blazed with a fierce intensity, which soon gave way to an unsettling calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others exchanged looks, sensing a distinct change in Osborne's demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't seem to simply return to his former self; rather, he appeared more imposing and in control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they kept their thoughts to themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was silent for a moment. Then he held out his hand, revealing a dazzling orb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the Orb of Reincarnation, a Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, this Sacred Artifact didn't possess any powerful offensive or defensive capabilities. Its sole function was to subtly influence the cycle of reincarnation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was through the Orb that Osborne was able to bring Clarissa, Emma, and the others back so swiftly, and it was also the reason for his own rapid rise in power during this lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything had been meticulously arranged using the Orb of Reincarnation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For instance, his encounter with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity in this life wasn't just a stroke of luck; it had been predetermined in his previous life. Osborne had already pinpointed the location of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity long before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By using the Orb of Reincarnation, he had orchestrated the events of his rebirth, allowing him to cross paths with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity at that crucial moment and obtain it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It sounded almost mystical, but that was the true power of the Orb of Reincarnation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could also be seen as a manipulation of fate!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to these preordained arrangements, Osborne was "destined" to marry Ophelia, to encounter Clarissa, Emma, Austin, and Isa, and to fall in love with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was also "fated' to meet the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything was set in motion long before in the Orb of Reincarnation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What an incredible Orb of Reincarnation!" Osborne couldn't help but exclaim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just for its ability to influence the cycle of reincarnation, the orb deserved its title as a Sacred Artifact, even if it lacked any offensive or defensive power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at the Orb for a long time before finally putting it away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget about the Creation Herald for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if he finds out I possess the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, he won't tell anyone. He'll just bide his time, waiting until he's strong enough to try and take it from me. But right now, he's not even close to being able to challenge me. That's why he destroyed the divine peak and fled from </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I suspect he's planning to wait until he breaks through to Empyrean Sacredness before making a move on my Ascending Sacred Sanctum. But by then..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile crept across Osborne's face as he continued, "By then, who knows if it'll be him trying to take from me or me taking from him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned to the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's head back! Next, I want to find my parents in this life... and then, I'll make my way to Racial Convergence Planet!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
