  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ha! Now that Diana can't help you, it's time for you to die!" Emmett laughed, closing the distance between himself and Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a confident grin, he launched a powerful punch, fueled by all the frustration he had bottled up after being pushed back by Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had been itching to unleash his anger, and Osborne was the perfect target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He intended to crush Osborne with a single blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The air crackled with tension as everyone braced for the inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all believed that Osborne, a mere beginner Celestial Deity, stood no chance against Emmett, who was on the verge of becoming a Deity Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The outcome seemed certain; nobody expected a twist in the story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Osborne appeared frozen, whether in shock or confidence that Diana would come to his aid. He showed no signs of dodging as Emmett's attack barreled toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The spectators could almost visualize the scene&mdash;Osborne being severely injured or even killed by Emmett's overwhelming force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But just as Emmett's punch was about to connect, something unexpected happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne finally moved, a cold smile creeping onto his face as he fixed his gaze on the attacking Emmett, as if Emmett were staring down a dead man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Slowly, he raised his hand, casually swatting at the incoming strike like one might swat away a fly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To everyone's shock, Emmett's powerful punch shattered against Osborne's hand, his divine power dispersing harmlessly into the air without even ruffling Osborne's clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emmett's confidence faltered, his eyes wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he could react, Osborne's hand shot out, gripping Emmett's fist with an iron grip. With a swift tug, he unleashed a terrifying force that pulled Emmett right into his range.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then came the thunderous impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's foot connected with Emmett's chest, producing a deafening sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emmett's chest caved in, his back arching grotesquely as a massive gaping wound erupted, blood and internal organs spilling forth like a volcanic eruption.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Emmett's eyes glazed over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hung suspended in the air, his fist still caught in Osborne's grip, but he could feel the life slipping away from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had delivered a powerful kick, shattering his insides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Y... You!" Emmett stammered, blood trickling from his lips as he struggled to form coherent words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's smile widened. "You think someone like you could kill me? Who gave you the nerve? You'd be better off going to hell! And next time, try to keep a lower profile. Don't be so arrogant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Osborne tossed Emmett's broken body to the ground like a rag doll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emmett hit the ground hard, the sound echoing in the silence that followed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blood pooled around him as he desperately tried to rise, but despair washed over Emmett, his body refusing to obey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Regret clawed at him. He mused, "Why did I ever dare to challenge Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Had I known the true extent of Osborne's power, I would never have provoked him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But it was too late for regrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the realization of Osborne's strength sank in, the others finally snapped back to reality. Their disbelief morphed into outrage as they stared at Osborne, unable to comprehend what had just unfolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You... You actually killed Mr. Emmett Huntington?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The middle-aged Deity Overlord, who had been holding Diana back, now looked at the crumpled form of Emmett, his eyes burning with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tears of rage filled his eyes as he glared at Osborne. "You're dead meat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's take him down! We'll avenge Mr. Emmett Huntington!" he roared, abandoning his hold on Diana and charging at Osborne, his Deity Overlord power surging with a ferocity that far exceeded Emmett's assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, the three peak Celestial Deities charged at Osborne, their eyes glinting with rage. They looked as though they would tear him limb from limb, every muscle tense with a desire for vengeance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the guards gathered around Riley abandoned their posts, leaving only two to protect him while the rest surged forward to confront Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Osborne found himself surrounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, instead of panicking, he remained calm and collected. After assessing that there was no chance to send an emergency message back to his base, he had made up his mind&mdash;he would take them all down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though these opponents were formidable, he didn't consider anyone here a threat, barring Riley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the two early-stage Deity Overlords didn't make him flinch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they closed in, the tension in the air was palpable, but Osborne's face broke into a satisfied smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Perfect! If you had scattered and run, I might have had to work a bit harder. But since you're all keen on avenging Emmett and choosing to attack me together, I won't hold back! Let's send you all to hell to join Emmett!" he declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Osborne unleashed his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Electricity crackled around him, forming a terrifying lightning storm. Thunder roared as lightning dragons spiraled upward, ready to strike those foolish enough to approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was the first eruption of his lightning elemental essence since advancing to mid-Level Six, and he intended to use it to full effect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The monstrous lightning dragons surged forward, overwhelming the group of attacking guards, including the two early-stage Deity Overlords.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What followed was a chorus of agonized screams, echoing in the chaos as, one by one, they were engulfed in the overwhelming storm that Osborne had unleashed.</span></p><div class="pagination">
