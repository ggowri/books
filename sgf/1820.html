  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne deactivated the time acceleration on the Supreme Malevolence Airship, and the vessel's speed returned to normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, have we arrived?" Anastasia and the others emerged from Hope Haven, joined by Sebastian, Divine Shadow, and God of Star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Darren was with them, the only one among the group familiar with the West Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, he had served as the deputy leader of the Pioneers of Starlight, leading his comrades against the Dark Deity Legion until they were ultimately defeated and captured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, squinting into the distance, "It looks like we're here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can see the Dark Deity Legion's camp!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren surveyed the surroundings, nodding gravely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My lord, we've definitely arrived! This area is firmly within the West Zone. I passed through here when I was supporting the front lines. Not long ago, this was a contested area, but in just a few years, it has fallen under the control of the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's shocking how quickly they've taken over&mdash;looks like the Human Community has been steadily pushed back, allowing the Dark Deity Legion to slowly encroach on our territory."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren's expression was serious, reflecting the weight of his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the last two hundred days, many of the former members of Pioneers of Starlight had reached the peak of the Deity Overlord realm with the help of Celestial Crystal, catching up to other Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren himself had made significant strides, breaking into the Deity King realm without relying on Miracle Elixirs, thanks to his natural talent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded thoughtfully. "Darren, you know the West Zone better than anyone. What do you think our next move should be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's pause, Darren replied, "My lord, if you don't have a specific target in mind, I suggest we head to Apocalypse City. It's one of the ten major cities in the West Zone, and we Pioneers of Starlight used to have a presence there. I know the place like the back of my hand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apocalypse City?" Osborne echoed, intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then asked, "How far is it from the Sanctum of Light?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren said quickly, "Not far at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In fact, Apocalypse City is the closest major city to the Sanctum of Light, only about 30 million miles away. Because of that, it's a hub for many factions. The strongest among them are the Baxter family and the Hudson family, along with the Celestial Harmony League and the Crimson Mist Confederation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They all hold Dukedom Level Power and dominate Apocalypse City. Additionally, other Dukedom Level Powers have branches there, so their influence is quite significant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then there are the numerous first-tier, second-tier, and third-tier forces! Our Pioneers of Starlight used to be a second-tier force."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Darren laid out the details about Apocalypse City, Osborne's interest was piqued, especially at the fact that the Baxter family, one of the ten great families, had its headquarters there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recalled their betrayal of the Human Community and their plot against the God of Light, and the lack of evidence he had to prove it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heading to Apocalypse City would provide him the perfect opportunity to keep an eye on the Baxter family and gather the evidence he needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was more, Darren mentioned that not far from Apocalypse City, there was a divine peak known as Apocalypse Divine Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's fantastic!" Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was currently at the mid-stage of the Deity King realm, but his elemental essence had stagnated due to the absence of Miracle Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Celestial Crystal had been depleted by the group's earlier indulgence, and they needed to replenish their resources quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The proximity of Apocalypse Divine Peak made it an ideal location to restock on Miracle Elixirs and Celestial Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, his resolve hardening, "Let's head to Apocalypse City then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then we're heading to Apocalypse City! There's a combat zone ahead with the Dark Deity Legion on guard. I plan to use interdimensional travel to zip right past them! Just tell me the location of Apocalypse City, and I'll teleport directly there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it!" Darren quickly provided the coordinates for Apocalypse City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also outlined the general terrain of the West Zone, including the locations of the ten major cities, the ten divine peaks, the Sanctum of Light, the Sanctum of Night, and the positions of twenty Dukedom Level Powers&mdash;laying it all out for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this extensive information, Osborne finally grasped the vastness of the West Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This place was enormous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Currently, they were about 1.2 billion miles from the center of the West Zone, while Apocalypse City was only 300 million miles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Osborne's strength, reaching their destination would only require about fifty interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another moment's hesitation, he called everyone back into Hope Haven, stowed the Supreme Malevolence Airship, and tore open a dimensional portal to commence his travels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Osborne found himself near a massive city, and as he took in the familiar architectural style, a smile crept across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had arrived&mdash;Apocalypse City!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First, let's check out the Pioneers of Starlight's base! Even though the Pioneers of Starlight was considered a second-tier power, it has a whole mountain as their headquarters in Apocalypse City. The Pioneers of Starlight may have been wiped out, but its base should still be intact. For now, we'll operate under the banner of the Pioneers of Starlight as we make our presence known in Apocalypse City!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
