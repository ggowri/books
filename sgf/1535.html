The gap in power between a Celestial Deity and a Deity Overlord was immense. Even the top talents among the various clans found it challenging to bridge that divide and take on an opponent of a higher rank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To defeat even the most ordinary Deity Overlord while standing at the pinnacle of Celestial Deity was a rare feat, a true mark of a super genius.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a member of the Paramount Supreme Clan, Tobey held his pride close. Now, standing at the peak of Celestial Deity himself, he was eager to prove his talent and potential by defeating a Deity Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he knew he wasn't yet ready to face a Deity Overlord warrior from the clans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why he aimed to find a weaker, less intelligent Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> to test his skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed to at least conquer a Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> before challenging the warriors of the clans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then would he feel confident enough to seek revenge on that mysterious woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sudden rush, the Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> was drawn in by the Ultimate Soul Resonance Fluid, entering the underground chamber. It seemed oblivious to Tobey, Myron, and Sara, its focus solely fixated on that single drop of fluid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its eyes glowed with excitement and greed as it approached the enticing scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey tightened his grip on the Supreme Malevolence Sword, with his battle spirit ignited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's do this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, he darted behind the Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, thrusting the Supreme Malevolence Sword with all his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, still entranced by the Ultimate Soul Resonance Fluid, only reacted when Tobey struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a moment of desperation, it tried to evade, but it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey's attack landed like a surprise ambush, the blade piercing through the </span><span>Deathborn's</span><span> defenses and into its flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> howled in agony, its body erupting with a surge of power that sent Tobey flying back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rage and murderous intent blazed in its eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No longer concerned about the Ultimate Soul Resonance Fluid, it charged at Tobey with a vengeance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey laughed heartily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> isn't so intimidating after all! You're already wounded&mdash;let's see if I can take you down today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Tobey engaged in a fierce battle with the Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that Tobey's strength far exceeded that of a typical Celestial Deity at its peak. Combined with the power of the Supreme Malevolence Sword, he was more than capable of facing the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> head-on, especially since he had already landed a heavy blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the fight unfolded, Tobey quickly gained the upper hand, pressing the Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Myron exclaimed, his eyes wide with awe, "Mr. Tobey Bowman is truly impressive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's actually managing to suppress a Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> we're talking about! Sure, it's not the brightest and doesn't have many tricks up its sleeve, but its power is undeniably at the Deity Overlord level! Most Celestial Deities at their peak would be lucky just to escape with their lives against a Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And yet, here's Mr. Tobey Bowman, holding his own! It looks like it won't be long before he slays this beast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There aren't many geniuses among the clans who can reach this level&mdash;no wonder he's from the Paramount Supreme Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aside from that mysterious woman who recently appeared, there aren't many in the younger generation who could take him on. He's just too formidable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Myron and Sara exchanged glances, their hearts swelling with pride and admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they were also at the peak of Celestial Deity, they knew deep down that they were no match for Tobey. Even without the Supreme Malevolence Sword in Tobey's hand, they wouldn't stand a chance against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fierce battle raged on for over twenty minutes before Tobey, his body feeling the strain, finally brought down the Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> with a decisive blow </span><span>from the Supreme Malevolence Sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, that was exhilarating! Now, that's what I call a fight!" he exclaimed, a mix of exhaustion and triumph washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had just taken out a Deity Overlord-level opponent through sheer skill and tenacity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he couldn't help but feel like he had earned his place among the super geniuses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wide grin, Tobey declared, "Ha! Who's going to underestimate me now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just killed a Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a shame there was only one; I'm still hungry for more! I want to take down several of these creatures in one go&mdash;that's when I'll truly prove my strength! Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His laughter echoed through the cavern, but just as he was basking in glory, the token on his chest began to glow with a faint red light once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression shifted to one of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey's heart raced with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Another surge of powerful energy? This one feels as strong as the last Deity Overlord!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What luck! I can keep fighting! But... wait a second, why is this energy fluctuation lingering? It seems to be stuck somewhere, not approaching me at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A frown crossed his face as he scanned the surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze landed on a nearby location where Osborne was in the midst of a transformation, breaking through to Transcendent Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that critical moment, the massive energy generated by his breakthrough began to leak out, uncontrolled and potent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne remained blissfully unaware of the chaos he was inadvertently causing.</span></p><div class="pagination">
