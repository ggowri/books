  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison did not hesitate. The uncut diamond that Wesley bought for 15 million dollars only turned into a bunch of garbage. She would not be disappointed even if nothing was cut out of the six pieces of uncut diamonds. They bought them for free anyway.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison didn&rsquo;t create suspense and just lifted the cover directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, everyone gathered around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The uncut diamond in the cutting machine had been cut into two halves. Two cross-sections appeared in front of everyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, everyone was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Purple! Its color is purple.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Oh my god. It&rsquo;s a violet diamond.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so big!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;This is worth at least tens of millions of dollars!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In an instant, everyone exclaimed. They breathed rapidly when they saw the glass-type violet diamond.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison was also stunned by the beautiful and noble violet diamond.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She seemed to have thought of something and looked at Osborne in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She suddenly remembered that Osborne had asked her about the price of the violet diamond before selecting this piece of uncut diamond.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And she told Osborne that she had seen a set of violet jewelry weighing a total of seven ounces. It was worth 100 million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And the violet diamond definitely weighed seven ounces. Moreover, the color was more noble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If she designed the jewelry and put it at auction, the price would definitely be beyond 100 million dollars. It also had 35 ounces of glass-type diamond. This piece was worth at least two hundred million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They didn&rsquo;t spend a penny on these six uncut diamonds. Wesley gave them it for free. Now, the first piece had been cut into a top-quality diamond worth at least 200 million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley was also dumbfounded at this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His eyes were red. His face was distorted and full of anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why did I spend 15 million dollars to buy a pile of garbage?</span> Wesley thought. <span style="font-style: italic;">But Osborne cut out a violet diamond from the junk material. It is worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And I gave him uncut diamonds for free.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley pressed his hand on his heart. He felt dizzy and wanted to vomit blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia was jealous at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She stared at that diamond. Why didn&rsquo;t this violet diamond belong to her? If she could design a whole set of jewelry with it, she would definitely become the most dazzling person. But there was no if. The violet diamond belonged to her competitor.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This made Ophelia even more jealous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison looked at Wesley and Ophelia with pride and sneered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to disappoint you. We didn&rsquo;t cut out any garbage from the uncut diamond. We cut out the best violet diamond and such a big piece of glass diamond.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley and Ophelia didn&rsquo;t want to talk at this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison suddenly felt bored and looked at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne remained calm the entire time. After all, he already knew what was in the uncut diamond. There was no surprise at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Open the others,&rdquo; Osborne said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison agreed with a smile and quickly opened the covers of the other five cutting machines one by one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">None of the five uncut diamonds had the violet diamond. But each one was cut into top-quality diamonds. They were almost all glass-type diamonds. There was even a tiny piece of Imperial Green.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In an instant, the entire casino was in an uproar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They came to uncut diamond casinos all year round. They knew the price of top-quality diamonds. The total cost of top-quality diamond cut from these five uncut diamonds was definitely more than 100 million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With the glass type and violet diamonds, they were worth three hundred million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was the price of raw materials. If top designers designed them into top-notch jewelry, it was normal for the price to double.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison couldn&rsquo;t hold back any longer and burst into laughter. The Ashford family&rsquo;s refusal to supply Luna Jewelry during this period put her under a lot of pressure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And now, all the pressure was gone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With this batch of top-quality diamond, it would be enough for Luna Jewelry to operate for a period of time. The most important thing was that they hadn&rsquo;t spent a penny on these top-grade diamonds worth at least 300 million dollars. The six pieces of uncut diamonds were all given by Wesley.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this moment, Wesley really vomited blood. His eyes were red, like a wild beast. His fingers were trembling, and he couldn&rsquo;t speak. Even his body was shaking slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia also felt like vomiting blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna Jewelry was the Caldwell Group&rsquo;s biggest competitor. She married Wesley for two reasons. Firstly, they wanted to have a stable supply of diamonds. Secondly, they tried to suppress Luna Jewelry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But now that Luna Jewelry had this batch of top-quality diamonds, the effect of her suppression was completely useless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;How could it be?&rdquo; Ophelia was unwilling to accept such a result. She suddenly glared at Osborne angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was all Osborne&rsquo;s fault. He selected these six pieces of uncut diamonds for Alison. If it weren&rsquo;t for Osborne, Alison would not have been able to obtain them. If Osborne helped Ophelia choose&hellip; she would be the one laughing triumphantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia was furious. She could only glare at Osborne fiercely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne ignored Ophelia and looked at Wesley with interest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He laughed and said, &ldquo;Wesley, are you vomiting blood now? I still have a piece of uncut diamond that I haven&rsquo;t cut open. If you see what&rsquo;s inside, you probably would faint.&rdquo;</p><div class="pagination">
