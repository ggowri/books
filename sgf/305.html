  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You guys come together to fight me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these words, Osborne's calm declaration plunged the surroundings into an eerie silence. All eyes were riveted on him with a mixture of shock and disbelief as if he had uttered something inconceivable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Brian looked at Osborne with a sudden expression of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kid, what did you just say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Nathan, with his fiery temper, who reacted first. His voice was harsh with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want us to team up against you? Do you dare to underestimate us? Don't think that just because you're the son of Allen, we won't dare to lay a hand on you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan's face flushed red with indignation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kaden, Ryan, and Queenie all wore expressions of displeasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kaden, somewhat dumbfounded, could only shake his head, muttering under his breath, "I can't be bothered to bully you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie snorted, "Impressive! Our family finally has someone more arrogant than me. I'm looking forward to seeing how you fare!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan sighed, "Osborne, perhaps you should reconsider."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, dismissing the suggestion, "No need to reconsider.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't wish to waste time, hence the four of you should join forces. This way, perhaps you can truly pressure me. Otherwise, you might not stand a chance of winning at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words sparked a flurry of discussions among the onlookers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This lad is unbearably arrogant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is he truly the son of Allen, who was such a gentle soul? How could he sire such an audacious son?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could there be some mistake?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No doubt about it. After all, he's been living on the streets since childhood, scavenging through trash cans and fighting with stray dogs for scraps. His personality must have been somewhat warped. If he wasn't a bit more assertive, he likely wouldn't have survived to this day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yet, observing his demeanor, he seems utterly confident. Does he truly believe he can take on four opponents alone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ridiculous! He must be unaware of the might of Nathan and the others. He'll rue this decision later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan snorted, "Only when the four of us join forces can we exert some pressure on you? Otherwise, we'd stand no chance? Boy, I must say, you are indeed audacious. Who do you think you are?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you fancy yourself as Alexander?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You aspire to defeat us, all by yourself, against four of us? If you can achieve that, not only will I acknowledge you as the heir of the Augustine family, but henceforth, I shall serve you like a slave. If you bid me to head east, I shall never veer west! If you command me to leap from a building, I shall not hesitate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes gleamed at these words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've spoken these words yourself; do you regret it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I ever regret this, let me rot in hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan's fury was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very well! Then, as you wish."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this juncture, Ryan interjected, "We share the same blood, so we are family. Let's not harm each other. It's just a competition."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other three nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie fixed her gaze on Osborne, saying, "You are indeed audacious, and I admire that. If you can truly best the four of us, I won't follow Nathan's path and serve you like a slave, but from this day forth, I shall also recognize you as my elder brother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and nodded. "That's splendid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having said that, Osborne glanced again at Ryan and Kaden, but the two remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In that case, let the battle commence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne's resolute stance and his insistence on facing four opponents alone, despite not believing Osborne could pull it off, Brian still harbored a vague hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That big shot holds such high hopes for him; perhaps he can truly achieve the impossible! If he can, then perhaps he can indeed alter the fortunes of our family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We must ensure it stops at the right moment without inflicting any critical harm."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian announced loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the five nod in agreement, he waved his hand, prompting everyone to retreat to a safe distance, leaving the expansive lawn as the arena for the impending confrontation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four challengers exchanged glances and suddenly dispersed, encircling Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly, allowing them to position themselves as they wished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what is your power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan abruptly inquired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne responded calmly, "You will discover my unique power shortly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No more idle chatter; let's engage!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, all four launched their attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan was the first to act. He swiftly formed a hand seal, and Osborne immediately felt a colossal force pressing down on him, causing his body to sink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan could control the gravity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, Osborne had faced off against a metahuman, also at the Class B+, adept </span><span>at controlling gravity. Back then, Osborne had been immobilized and unable to move, resorting to his spatial power to split space and escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Osborne's strength improved greatly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His physical prowess was even more terrifying than that of the average Class B+ martial artist. Every cell in his body brimmed with power, akin to a Tyrannosaurus Rex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such gravitational pressure could not hold him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he did not act immediately; instead, he observed the other three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan transformed into a being of fire at this moment. He pointed at Osborne, and suddenly, dozens of fireballs assailed Osborne. The speed of the fireballs was not too swift. Evidently, Nathan was concerned that Osborne might not evade them, so he was prepared to control them at will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie, on the other hand, had not altered much. As a mind control metahuman, her powers were invisible to the naked eye. With a mere thought, her mind control could assume any form and assail Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had yet to take any action. Clearly, she was still reluctant to attack Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the last, Kaden, he had already undergone a transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally towering over six feet, after the transformation, he reached a staggering ten feet. His muscles bulged, and he charged towards Osborne like a rampaging Hulk.</span></p><div class="pagination">
