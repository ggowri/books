  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne also stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because he knew that it was meaningless to escape. He looked at Gerardo coldly, but he was thinking of a solution in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo sneered, "Osborne... No, I should call you Godfather now. Sebastian actually gave up the position of Godfather to someone so young as you. I guess his injury must be very serious, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's only been a few days since we last met. I thought it would take some time to catch you, but I didn't expect you to run out again to save Bryce, and I didn't expect us to meet again so soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It&rsquo;s destiny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are indeed very capable. I cloned the 'Jackals' with great difficulty, but you, together with Bryce, killed 60 of them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder Sebastian passed the position of Godfather to you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unfortunately, you are only in Class AAA. In front of me, you are like an ant! It's too easy for me to crush you to death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted coldly, "It&rsquo;s a coincidence. After all, the person who will kill you soon may be me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo laughed loudly, full of contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill me? Just you? Not to mention that you are only in Class AAA; even if you break through Class S, you are still like an ant in front of me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, I'm not in a hurry to kill you. Follow me back to the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> and I will morph you into a Human Slave! But for now, I won't destroy your consciousness because I want you to see with your own eyes how I brutally killed Sebastian!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finishing saying this, Gerardo took action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not easy to catch me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was impossible for Osborne to surrender without a fight. Although he knew very well that even if he </span><span>take</span><span> all his strength, he would never be a match for Gerardo, he still had to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne attacked frantically. The martial art aura burst out and even temporarily blocked the attack of Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such a strong martial art aura!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't say anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo was a top-level Class S being, and he ranked 60th on the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speaking of which, the ranking of Gerardo was lower than that of Sin and Crimson, and his strength was also a little weaker. Osborne could hold on for a period of time in front of Sin and Crimson, so it was possible that he could block Gerardo for a period of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But only if Gerardo was in his normal state!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's greatest trump card was that he could merge with the god's corpse and use divine power for a short period of time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The stronger you are, the more I like you! When I refine you into a Human Slave, you will become the most powerful Human Slave and the most powerful weapon in my hands!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo finally got serious about his actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just surrender!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's body changed at this moment. In just a few breaths, he turned into the appearance of Medusa again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He merged with the body of the Goddess Medusa!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bright light burst out of his eyes, shining on Osborne's body. Osborne's martial art aura emitted a violent sizzling sound, and he only resisted for three seconds before collapsing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne was petrified!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body could no longer move, except for his eyeballs and tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo looked at him with a sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was extremely solemn at this moment as he stared closely at Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hoped that Gerardo's body would have problems like last time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, this did not happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo sneered, "I told you that you don't stand a chance this time! You won&rsquo;t see my body to have any problems. I have complete control over the body of the Goddess Medusa now. I can merge it at will, and there will be no rejection anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Osborne became more anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo had become scarier than before and had completely taken control of the body of the Goddess Medusa, so nothing would go wrong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Gerardo's current strength, he had every chance of breaking into the top 20 of the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even into the top ten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, follow me back obediently, and I will refine you into my Human Slave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a force wrapped around Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo had returned to his original appearance, and he tore the dimensional rift apart with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, the two appeared 497 miles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's interdimensional travel was 497 miles away, which was four times that of Osborne's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne's face became even gloomier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It only took a few interdimensional travels, and they reached </span><span>Tethynia</span><span>, the headquarters of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, which was a base built in the mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Gerardo fell, the rock walls of the mountain opened, revealing a steel passage leading directly to the belly of the mountain. After they entered, the rock walls closed again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The passage was brightly lit. They walked for a mile and finally arrived at a huge mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is my kingdom!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
