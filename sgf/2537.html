  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only a small portion of those who entered the Phantomagic Realm came from the surrounding Stellar Regions, while the majority were Space Pirates and Stellar Explorers from Stellar Region M72.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They don't have fixed clan forces, so they carry most of their wealth with them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once they die, all their wealth becomes Osborne's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne gained a lot this time in the Phantomagic Realm. But these gains are nothing compared to the ninety-nine Bewitching Lanterns.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those ninety-nine Bewitching Lanterns are the truly valuable things.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the ninety-nine Bewitching Lanterns absorbed all the power of the Phantomagic Realm. Each Bewitching Lantern can eventually become a Supreme Sacred Artifact. Once the ninety-nine Bewitching Lanterns are fused, there's a high chance they could turn into an Imperial Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An Imperial Artifact is worth far more than a hundred Supreme Sacred Artifacts, so Osborne isn't too impressed with these things right now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, there are only thirty-six Legendary Sacred Artifacts here, not even a single Supreme Sacred Artifact. In Osborne's eyes, those people are too poor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What Osborne truly cares about are the materials that can be used to build the Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The materials for building the Cosmic Translocator are numerous and complex. If Osborne were to collect them alone, it would take him a lot of time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, all those materials have been gathered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All the materials can build hundreds of Level One Cosmic Translocators, dozens of Level Two Cosmic Translocators, and a few extra Level Three Cosmic Translocators.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For Osborne, these materials can last a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He then put away several Dimensional Bags filled with materials.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the other items, he said to Angela and Agatha, "Take whatever you like. Don't be polite with me. These things are of no use to me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Angela and Agatha widened their eyes, feeling his words were incredibly bold.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne had the right to say such things because there was so much here that Angela and Agatha couldn't calm down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Can we really take whatever we want?" Angela asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hesitating for a moment, she continued, "Can we take everything we want? Including those Superior Sacred Artifact warships? And also those Legendary Sacred Artifacts?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile, then nodded and said, "I mean everything. As long as you like them and find them useful, you can take them freely. If you're shy, I'll help you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne picked up the Dimensional Bag containing the Legendary Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Dimensional Bag contained a total of thirty-six Legendary Sacred Artifacts. Among them, the majority were offensive Sacred Artifacts, including various knives, swords, hammers, and gauntlets. Additionally, there were over a dozen defensive Sacred Artifacts and a few auxiliary Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne glanced at Angela and Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela previously used a Superior Sacred Artifact longsword and a Mid-grade Defensive Sacred Artifact round shield. Coincidentally, the Dimensional Bag contained similar ones.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne directly took out a Legendary Sacred Artifact longsword, a Legendary Sacred Artifact shield, and an auxiliary Sacred Artifact, then forcibly handed them to Angela.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "These three Legendary Sacred Artifacts are yours. Also, feel free to tell me if you need anything else. As long as it's inside, you can have it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne selected three Legendary Sacred Artifacts for Agatha: a Legendary Sacred Artifact war blade, a Legendary Sacred Artifact long whip, and a shield.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Agatha, these are yours."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne set down this Dimensional Bag and picked up another Dimensional Bag.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Inside this Dimensional Bag, there were only five Superior Sacred Artifact warships.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Each of you take a Superior Sacred Artifact warship." Saying this, Osborne forcibly handed one Superior Sacred Artifact warship to both Angela and Agatha. Then, he immediately picked up several more Dimensional Bags. These Dimensional Bags were filled with Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each Dimensional Bag contained one billion Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Each of you gets 40 billion Sacred Crystals. I still have 100 billion Sacred Crystals left. So, don't feel embarrassed or think it's too little. Sacred Crystals don't mean much to me." After saying this, Osborne still didn't stop his actions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He still had fifty Dimensional Bags filled with various miscellaneous materials and treasures. He casually handed ten Dimensional Bags each to Agatha and Angela.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"These miscellaneous materials are worth a lot of money and might be useful to you at critical moments. I didn't specifically sort them. Each of you gets ten Dimensional Bags, and I'll keep thirty for myself." After saying this, Osborne still didn't stop.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Angela and Agatha were stunned. Holding a dozen Dimensional Bags, several Legendary Sacred Artifacts, and Superior Sacred Artifact warships, they stood frozen in place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is too much!" Finally, Agatha spoke, stopping Osborne from trying to take out more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said solemnly, "Osborne, you're giving us too much. We haven't done anything. How can we take so much from you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela quickly added, "Yes, this is too much!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Angela felt her whole body go numb. The things Osborne forcibly gave them were simply too much and too valuable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three Legendary Sacred Artifacts and a Superior Sacred Artifact warship for each person were already priceless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne also gave each of them 40 billion Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That&rsquo;s 40 billion Sacred Crystals! With some luck, 40 billion Sacred Crystals could buy several Legendary Sacred Artifacts. Besides that, Osborne also gave each of them ten Dimensional Bags filled with various resources and treasures.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These items were worth at least tens of billions of Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, they felt unworthy of receiving these things.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were just accompanying Osborne to rescue his parents, never expecting any reward, but now Osborne had given them things they had never seen in their lives.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With just these items, they could definitely be considered among the wealthiest warriors in Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most warriors at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection were definitely not as wealthy as they were.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, that's enough. This is really enough!" Angela and Agatha were a bit flustered. At this moment, Osborne was like someone throwing money at them with force.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How could they repay Osborne for everything they took from him? Did Osborne want them to repay with their bodies?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Angela and Agatha both blushed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had no idea what Angela and Agatha were thinking at the moment. He smiled faintly. "There&rsquo;s so much stuff here. If you don&rsquo;t help me take some, how could I possibly use it all by myself? Leaving it with me would be such a waste."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I still have some things to give you. However, it's up to you. If you need them, take them. If not, I'll just put them away for now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne took out many jadeflare vials.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The contents of these jadeflare vials were naturally Dragon Elixir, and all of them were Top-grade Dragon Elixir and Legendary Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne obtained a total of 10,000 drops of Top-grade Dragon Elixir and 400 drops of Legendary Dragon Elixir in the Phantomagic Realm this time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After giving Adriana 2,000 drops of Top-grade Dragon Elixir and 200 drops of Legendary Dragon Elixir, he now has 8,000 drops of Top-grade Dragon Elixir and 200 drops of Legendary Dragon Elixir left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took out some and forcibly handed them to Angela and Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, we are companions. Whether you contributed or not, you are entitled to these. So, each of you will get 100 drops of Top-grade Dragon Elixir and 20 drops of Legendary Dragon Elixir."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's not that I don't want to give you more, but giving you more would be useless." Saying this, Osborne finally stopped distributing.</span></p><div class="pagination">
