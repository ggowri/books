  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Virgil lose? Not quite. In the end, he had no choice but to activate his Luminous Armor, effectively blocking most of Osborne's attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't, he might have sustained serious injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the Luminous Armor absorbed the force of the Spatial Collapse, it still caused Virgil to spit blood and drop to the ground. Thankfully, he wasn't seriously hurt. He quickly got back up, his face a mask of seriousness as he stared at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you've really surprised me! I came in here wanting to fight you fairly on my own, but I've been forced to rely on the Luminous Armor. Technically, I've already lost. But if I admit defeat, it would be too humiliating&mdash;my father would definitely have my head. So, I guess I'll just have to tough it out and keep fighting with the Luminous Armor!" Virgil said with a bitter smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, he already sensed the vast gap between them. His attacks were ineffective against Osborne, whose spatial barrier provided formidable defense. Sure, he could break through it, but Osborne could easily sidestep his strikes using spatial power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He simply couldn't evade Osborne's attacks; his own divine power was no match and crumbled easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was an overwhelming disparity, one that filled Virgil with despair. As the top genius of the younger generation in the Hudson family, he ranked among the top 20 in the Human Community. Yet, facing Osborne&mdash;a peer with a lower level&mdash;he felt an insurmountable gap that he found hard to accept. He couldn't even gauge where Osborne's limits lay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, he was determined to use the Luminous Armor to continue battling Osborne, hoping to gauge just how strong Osborne truly was and how vast the divide between them really was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "Virgil, you don't need to say that. Divine artifacts are part of your strength. The Luminous Armor is yours, and you should've used it sooner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Virgil nodded. "Shall we continue then? Osborne, unleash your full strength and show me what you've got! Otherwise, you might find it hard to break my defense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Virgil charged again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to the Luminous Armor, he no longer had to focus solely on defense. Though the defensive capabilities of his Ultimate Luminous Armor weren't as formidable as Caesar's Supreme Sovereign Armor, the difference wasn't drastic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, when Caesar wore the Supreme Sovereign Armor against Osborne's eight Spatial Clones, he withstood their relentless assaults for several minutes without yielding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Osborne had no means to counter the Supreme Sovereign Armor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Osborne was at a higher level, making him significantly stronger than before, breaking through the Ultimate Luminous Armor with just a Spatial Clone was still a tall order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, when faced with Virgil's frenzied attacks, Osborne opted for a more mobile strategy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He dodged Virgil's strikes while occasionally using the Space Collapse to wear him down. Though he couldn't break through the Luminous Armor, if he persisted, it would only be a matter of time before Virgil couldn't keep it up any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Luminous Armor had incredible defensive power, but it drained a lot of divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Virgil was at the advanced Deity King Level, he could probably maintain it for only 10 minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the fierce battle raged on, it became increasingly frustrating for Virgil. No matter how hard he tried, his attacks couldn't hurt Osborne at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no way to stop Osborne from using his spatial power and couldn't even graze him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Virgil spread his attacks out and launched ranged strikes, Osborne could easily fend them off, and his space barrier remained unbroken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, Virgil saw no glimmer of hope for victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time dragged on, he felt his divine power being drained quickly. Unless he found a way out, defeat was inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Osborne pointed at Zachary, who was watching the fight from a distance, and suddenly, the space around him began to warp and collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uncle Zachary, you should join the fight too!" Osborne said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary countered with a punch that shattered the force of the Space Collapse, his expression grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you frustrated with Virgil for not putting enough pressure on you? How dare you challenge me and ask me to join you in this fight? If that's the case, then count me in!" With that, Zachary leaped into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the highest Deity King Level, Zachary was among the top fighters in the Hudson family, far stronger than Virgil. With his involvement, Osborne finally felt an increase in pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to concentrate more; one slip-up could leave him vulnerable to an attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle stretched on for another 10 minutes. Virgil was running on divine power and could no longer sustain the formidable defense of the Luminous Armor. He was the first to fall to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary was stronger, but he found himself in the same predicament as Virgil. His attacks couldn't breach Osborne's defenses either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Zachary was also defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fighting stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Breathless, Zachary stared at Osborne and said, "Osborne, you're the leader of the Seven Young Deity Kings of the Human Community, aren't you?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
