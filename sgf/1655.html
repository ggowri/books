  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Diana emerged from her meditation, her eyes landing on Osborne, who was deep in thought with a furrowed brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Concerned, she asked, "Osborne, what's on your mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't hold back; he shared everything he knew about the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana paused, taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected Osborne to be so well-informed about the Deity King team, especially regarding Angelo's ability to eliminate a Deity Overlord-level Deathborn from two miles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't pry further; she was already accustomed to Osborne's uncanny skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, frowning, "The power of a Deity King warrior is indeed beyond our comprehension. When I explored Divine Peak Nine alongside a Deity King warrior, I was right next to him, yet I still couldn't grasp the extent of his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe my own power was too low back then to understand his methods. However, I vividly remember the final battle when we were besieged by thousands of Deathborn. The sheer force unleashed by the Deity King warrior was cataclysmic!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it hadn't been for his ferocious outburst, we would have been wiped out completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I feel that the might of a Deity King warrior isn't just about purer and more advanced divine power or sheer destructive capability. It's about their mastery of the rules and their ability to use power to reshape reality."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's words sent Osborne into deep contemplation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not just about stronger divine power; it's about manipulating the rules? The ability to alter reality with power?" He murmured, pondering the implications.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought about his own spatial power, which had reached Level Seven&mdash;the same tier as a Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hitting that level, his spatial power had indeed become formidable. Techniques like Spatial Clone, Spatial Cleaving, and Spatial Sealing were incredibly powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Angelo's ability to detect hidden Deathborn from two miles away is not just due to his keen perception. He must be leveraging the effects of his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what kind of power does Angelo possess?" Osborne asked, curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana shook her head, admitting she didn't know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly turned to Riley, who provided the answer without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Angelo's power is mind control!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mind control? Really? Just a basic mind control power?" Osborne was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mind control was relatively common, and to Osborne, it didn't seem all that impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had possessed mind control power for a long time, but he had long since moved on, finding it less useful compared to his other skills, which were far more effective.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had expected Angelo's power to be something unique and extraordinary, only to discover it was a simple, even somewhat weak, form of mind control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana spoke up, her tone firm, "There's nothing strange about it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The simpler a power is, the easier it is to grow. It's the more powerful and rare abilities that are difficult to cultivate and break through with. That's why most Deity King warriors don't have particularly strong elemental powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those who lack the potential or talent simply can't elevate a powerful, rare ability to Level Seven! They'll forever remain stuck below the Deity King threshold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But, of course, when we say 'not strong,' that's in comparison to others. Once you reach the Deity King realm and your elemental essence breaks through to Level Seven, even the simplest power can yield unimaginable effects!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take Angelo's mind control power, for example. If any peak Deity Overlord warrior were to use it, it wouldn't be that impressive. But when a Deity King uses it? That's a different story altogether.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's like my own earth elemental power, which is pretty straightforward. To be honest, I rarely use my power outside of mining for Essence Crystals since divine power usually packs a bigger punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if I ever reach the Deity King stage and my earth elemental essence hits Level Seven, the impact of my elemental power will far surpass any divine power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, of course, comparing Deity Kings to Deity Overlords, the stronger the elemental power, the stronger the warrior! But even for the most talented geniuses, it's still tough to push a powerful elemental power up to Level Seven!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's why there are so few Deity Kings with truly formidable elemental powers. Each one is exceptional among their peers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, absorbing her insights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I get it now! I think I can figure out how Angelo detected those hidden Deathborn two miles away and how he was able to take them out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Level Seven mind control elemental essence..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pondered thoughtfully, "Now that I understand his methods, we can better prepare ourselves! At Divine Peak Nine, his mind control should easily allow him to spot disguised Deity Overlords from two miles away. We need to keep our distance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Resolving to be cautious, Osborne felt a surge of determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a clearer picture of Angelo's abilities, the Deity King no longer seemed so formidable&mdash;at least not to him, someone who also possessed a Level Seven spatial elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of his current capabilities, he felt fearless against anyone below the Deity King level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, when it came to facing a Deity King, Osborne recognized the significant gap that still lay between them.</span></p><div class="pagination">
