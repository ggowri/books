  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a powerful strike sent Gerardo flying, blood spewing from his mouth. Osborne was swept along by the force, landing beside Sebastian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne exclaimed, shock evident in his voice, "Grandpa! What are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian turned to look at Osborne, his aged face pale, a stark reminder that his injuries were far from healed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, despite the pain, a smile crept across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian replied, "I've been here, recovering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I noticed when Gerardo brought you in, but I couldn't intervene at the time. I had to wait for the right moment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been keeping an eye on everything that's happened here over the past couple of days. You handled George's humiliation and torment remarkably well. Not only did you turn the tables on him, but you also managed to injure Gerardo. If it weren't for you forcing him to use his Spatial Domain, I wouldn't have found the opening I needed to strike."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at Sebastian, astonished. He had no idea his grandfather had been hiding out here all along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian continued, "But what surprises me the most is that you managed to break free from the God Binding Rope! Even I have to tread carefully against Gerardo's binding; once he ensnares you, it's nearly impossible to escape. That's why I've always been at a disadvantage when fighting him, which led to my injuries. Now that he's lost </span><span>the God Binding Rope, I have no reason to fear him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's gaze turned to Osborne, filled with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay back for now. I'll deal with Gerardo first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned his icy stare toward Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's face twisted with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe Sebastian had been hiding right under his nose all this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sebastian, you've got some nerve! You've been lurking in my territory! But you're still nursing those serious wounds, aren't you? Do you think, without the God Binding Rope, you can take me on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ridiculous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you dare to show your face, you might as well stay here for good! I'll repay you for the humiliation you dealt me decades ago! Let's fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the two were locked in a fierce battle, unleashing waves of terrifying energy as they clashed. The intensity of their confrontation sent Osborne reeling back, his expression grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne realized now that Gerardo hadn't been fighting at full strength before. The power he wielded against Sebastian was much greater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're powerful!" Osborne thought, watching from a distance, worry gnawing at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Sebastian's injuries weren't fully healed; otherwise, Sebastian would have returned to the Augustine Estate long ago. Even without the God Binding Rope, Sebastian's wounded state made it a tall order to defeat Gerardo, especially given Gerardo's higher rank on the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the battle unfolded, it quickly became clear that Sebastian was falling behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo seemed to grow stronger with each passing moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Gerardo struck Sebastian with a powerful blow, sending him crashing back, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo burst into laughter, his eyes glinting with derision as he fixed a scornful gaze on Sebastian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sebastian! Is this really all you've got? The once-promising prodigy who rose like a comet now stands at this pathetic level? You've truly let me down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Given your talent, you should've cracked the top twenty in the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings by now, maybe even aimed for the top ten! But look at you&mdash;you haven't just stagnated; you've regressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems those years spent chasing after your missing son and his wife have cost you dearly. You're simply not up to par anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had some special moves saved just for you, but at this rate, I won't even need them to take you down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, his smugness radiated through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian fell silent, his expression unreadable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Osborne, a wave of realization washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hadn't anticipated Gerardo's high regard for Sebastian, believing him capable of breaking into the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings' top twenty, maybe even vying for </span><span>the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, the years spent searching for Osborne's lost parents had dulled Sebastian's edge, and he had not only failed to advance but slipped backward instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, all the resentment Osborne had harbored toward Sebastian evaporated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clenching his teeth, he surged forward, positioning himself next to his grandfather, ready to face Gerardo together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, I'm fighting by your side!" Osborne declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian jolted at the words, turning to look at Osborne, a genuine smile breaking through his earlier silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great! Today, the two of us will stand shoulder to shoulder in battle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce gaze fixed on Gerardo, Sebastian's resolve hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gerardo, bring it on!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
