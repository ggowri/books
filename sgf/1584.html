  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A grand scheme, involving a whole lot of people, began!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to Osborne's plan, today was Donald's first official day on the job. Guy gave him a warm welcome, showed him some goodwill, and officially made Donald a centurion under his command, letting him pick his team freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, after choosing his team, Donald decided to take them out to celebrate, and the place he picked just happened to be on the west side of town&mdash;very close to Laird Borden's mistress' house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This gave Donald and Murray a legitimate reason to be there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most of the members Donald chose were talented elites from various clans and factions&mdash;perfect witnesses for what was about to happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, they'd also end up "injured" by "Laird," drawing even more groups into the mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, after nightfall, Donald and Murray, along with their chosen one hundred and ten soldiers, swaggered out of the base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before heading out to "celebrate," Donald even called Herman Saxton, letting him know where he'd be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Naturally, Herman had no objections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He even praised "Guy" for being considerate, since according to the rules of the Wild Flame Army, Donald wasn't supposed to leave the base without permission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fact that Donald could take his men out showed that Guy was extending an olive branch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Herman also wasn't worried about Donald's safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Given Donald's status, no one in Wild Flame City would dare mess with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And so, Donald led his group, marching confidently to the west side of town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They celebrated and drank in a tavern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne, having learned from Guy that Laird was already heading in their direction, began to move. He approached the courtyard where Laird's mistress lived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly scoped out the place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was a divine lock on the courtyard gate, and without the key, it would be impossible to enter quietly without alerting everyone inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But for Osborne, that was no problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He activated his Satan's Eye to check out the courtyard. Seeing only Laird's mistress and about seven or eight servants, none stronger than a low-level Celestial Deity, Osborne used his spatial power to slip inside without setting off the divine lock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By now, Osborne had completely altered his appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked exactly like Donald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly made his way deeper into the courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Using his power, he knocked out the servants in seconds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who's there?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A stunning, sultry woman stared at Osborne, her face going pale, eyes full of alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne mimicked Donald's voice, sneering, "What a beautiful woman! Just what I need tonight to blow off some steam!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Osborne lunged at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The woman gasped in shock and tried to fight back. She was a low-level Celestial Deity, but against Osborne, she stood no chance. After a brief struggle, she was knocked out cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Got a good look at my face, didn't she?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne muttered, stripping the unconscious woman and tossing her onto the ground. He even made sure to make the scene look like she'd been assaulted&mdash;though he found it disgusting, it was part of the plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He left behind a few traces, including an identification tag...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One belonging to Donald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After finishing, Osborne smirked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Laird, this is your favorite woman. I don't believe for a second you won't lose it when you see this. You're definitely going to think Donald did this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mumbling to himself, Osborne quickly left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Time for the next phase!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By now, Donald and his group had finished their feast and were just leaving the tavern, heading down a street near the courtyard on their way back to the base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And right there, on that street, they ran into Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, Osborne had taken on Laird's appearance, even wearing clothes that Guy had secretly swiped from Laird's wardrobe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The clothes even carried Laird's scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter who saw him, they'd be convinced he was Laird.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Laird," having been bumped into by Donald, flew into a rage, not giving Donald or his men a chance to explain. He attacked immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a brief but intense fight, the peak Deity Overlord "Laird" easily left Donald, Murray, and the others badly injured, nearly destroying their divine essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the soldiers Donald had brought along were hurt by "Laird."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After that, Osborne, still in disguise, used Laird's voice to threaten Donald, glaring down at him before turning and heading back to the courtyard...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And all of it was recorded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Laird, let's see how you get out of this one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne muttered, ordering Donald and the others to leave quickly before they ran into the real Laird.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, all that was left was to let the situation escalate!</span></p><div class="pagination">
