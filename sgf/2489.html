  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Regarding Frenetic Storm Warband, we've almost completed the investigation. I have some matters to handle. Also, the situation is a bit complicated, and I can't explain it clearly over the terminal. I'll have Angela come to you. She will accompany you on the mission." Adriana finished speaking and directly hung up the terminal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after, Angela arrived outside their small courtyard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela was no longer a member of Mystic Sirius Sect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Mystic Sirius Sect had already been destroyed by Adriana. Angela completed her mission and returned to Fairy Moon Sect. Now, she was an ordinary Elder of Fairy Moon Sect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne invited Angela into the small courtyard. Then, Angela carefully observed Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Touching his face, Osborne asked in confusion, "What's wrong? Ms. Olsen, why are you looking at me like that?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela smiled and said, "Don't call me Ms. Olsen anymore. With your current strength, you should be able to defeat an ordinary warrior at Empyrean Sacredness. Just call me Angela. Actually, I'm not much older than you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, Osborne was stunned for a moment, then nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela was at mid Empyrean Sacredness, just a step away from reaching advanced Empyrean Sacredness. Her cultivation level seemed much higher than Osborne's. However, if they were to fight, Osborne wouldn't fear Angela. Although he might not defeat her, he wouldn't lose by much.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he gave it his all, Osborne felt the winner would most likely be him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, even if he couldn't defeat Angela alone, he could summon Flash, and even Drum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just the Silver Beetles raised by Drum could easily surround Angela and kill her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is a strength-oriented world. Since their powers are on the same level, they can interact as equals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, congratulations on winning the championship in the zone duel with a huge advantage. Unfortunately, I had some important matters to attend to, so I couldn't be there to watch the match and witness your moment of glory," Angela said with some regret.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Smiling, Osborne casually chatted with Angela for a bit, then hurriedly asked, "Angela, what's the situation with the Frenetic Storm Warband? Ms. Alba said things are a bit complicated. There&rsquo;s no trouble, is there?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very worried.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His parents had been sold to the Frenetic Storm Warband over twenty years ago. He couldn&rsquo;t be sure if they were still alive. Now, he finally had news about the Frenetic Storm Warband. How could he not be excited?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry," Angela said. "I came here specifically for this matter. Here's what we found out. Take a look."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela then handed a document to Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly took it and started skimming through it. Then, he frowned deeply, looking somewhat serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After reading the document, Osborne quickly started thinking, pondering, "The Frenetic Storm Warband belongs to a Second-rate Stellar Exploration Organization, specializing in searching for undiscovered resource-bearing planets on the edge of the cosmos, then conducting exploration and mining operations."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its leader is Taylor Watts, reportedly having reached Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its three deputy leaders are Eden Watts, Shiloh Watts, and Bellamy Kamden, all at advanced Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even on the Racial Convergence Planet, the Frenetic Storm Warband is considered the strongest among Second-rate Powers. It is far more powerful than Second-rate Powers like the Mystic Sirius Sect, where only the sect leader Lenny is at advanced Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, the Frenetic Storm Warband has long been exploring dangerous zones on the edge of the cosmos, facing various Space Pirates and Space Plunderers. They are highly experienced in combat and extremely ruthless and cunning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Currently, the Frenetic Storm Warband operates in a nameless, numbered Stellar Region on the edge of the cosmos, known as Stellar Region M72. The environment in Stellar Region M72 is harsh, complex, and extremely chaotic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There are many Stellar Exploration Organizations, Space Pirates, and Space Plunderers there. Even numerous ruthless fugitives hide in the area for years.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, even though the Fairy Moon Sect's intelligence network is very powerful, they only know the approximate location of the Frenetic Storm Warband and that they rested on a planet in Stellar Region M72 about six months ago.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Fairy Moon Sect cannot trace where the Frenetic Storm Warband went afterward. The planet they stayed on six months ago is called Inferno Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Angela said, "Osborne, the Fairy Moon Sect's intelligence department can only uncover this much. We must personally go to Inferno Planet in Stellar Region M72 and continue investigating the specifics."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was definitely going to Inferno Planet in Stellar Region M72. After all, he finally got news about the Frenetic Storm Warband. If he didn&rsquo;t follow the clues to find them and rescue his parents, he would never find peace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked, "Is there a direct Cosmic Translocator from Racial Convergence Planet to Inferno Planet in Stellar Region M72?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela shook her head and said, "There's no direct Cosmic Translocator from Racial Convergence Planet to Inferno Planet, but there is one to the edge of Stellar Region M72. We can first teleport to the edge of Stellar Region M72 and then figure out a way to get to Inferno Planet. It shouldn't take too long."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded, thinking, "As long as I can get there quickly. After all, I still have to participate in the Glorious Divine War in half a year. I can't be away for too long. In that case..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne stood up. "I'll head over now. Angela, please help me thank Ms. Alba for the information. Whether I can find the Frenetic Storm Warband or rescue my parents, I owe her another favor."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela smiled and said, "You'd better thank Ms. Alba in person. Ms. Alba said I should go with you. Stellar Region M72 is chaotic and dangerous. Racial Convergence Planet has its rules."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But in Stellar Region M72, strength is the rule. You haven't reached Empyrean Sacredness yet. If you go to Stellar Region M72 alone, it's too dangerous. Don't argue with me. I know you're strong, but your cultivation level is too low, and it's easy for others to take advantage of you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm currently at mid Empyrean Sacredness and can reach advanced Empyrean Sacredness anytime. If I go with you, you'll face much less trouble."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides, this is the task Ms. Alba assigned to me. If you don't let me go with you, I won't be able to report back to Ms. Alba."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Angela looked at Osborne seriously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned tightly. He knew Stellar Region M72 was dangerous, so he didn't want Angela to go with him, fearing she might get dragged into trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, since Angela had already said so, he couldn't refuse her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Agatha walked out of the room and calmly said, "Osborne, I heard everything. If you're going to save your parents, I'll go with you. Besides, I've been training for too long lately. I want to find a place to stretch a bit."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing her words, Osborne was even more speechless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, Osborne agreed. Although Agatha was currently only at primary Empyrean Sacredness, her true strength was about the same as Angela's. After all, she was the Dark Phoenix.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Osborne couldn't guarantee that he could definitely defeat Agatha now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With their help, his operation might go more smoothly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said seriously, "Alright. Thank you for being willing to help me and accompany me on this adventure. Don't worry. As long as I'm alive, I won't let you fall into danger."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Agatha and Angela smiled and didn't mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, the three of them left the inn together and used the translocator in Tempest Fortress City to reach the largest nearby city.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Here lies the Cosmic Translocator leading to the edge of Stellar Region M72.</span></p><div class="pagination">
