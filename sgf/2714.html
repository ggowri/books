  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick's words hit Osborne's mind like a thunderclap.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "I'm not Emperor Frederick's son?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My mother had an affair with another man behind his back?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked stunned. He hadn't expected this outcome and wasn't sure if it was good news or bad news for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The good news is that he is not Frederick's son.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt only hatred and a desire to kill Frederick. Naturally, he was glad to cut ties with someone as ruthless as Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even in this life, he had no connection to Frederick, but he was still happy that his past self could sever ties with Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What Osborne couldn't accept was Frederick saying that Michelle betrayed him!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne glared at Frederick angrily. "How dare you slander my mother?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick sneered, "Slander her? How could I! As the emperor of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, I wouldn't tarnish my reputation over something like this!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You... or rather, the you from the past life, were indeed not my son! Besides me, Michelle knew this too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clenched his fists, glaring at Frederick. "Then it must be your fault! My mother was just an ordinary maid in the palace. As the emperor of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, why would you fall for her?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I understand now. My mother actually had someone she loved, but you forced yourself on her, didn't you? Unfortunately, by then she was already pregnant with me. My mother didn't betray you; you forced yourself on her!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes filled with tears.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He recalled everything about Michelle. She was so kind and gentle. She was definitely not the kind of person Frederick described.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least, he didn't believe it!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick sneered, "I told the truth, but you still don't believe it. Then I have nothing more to say. You think Michelle is a good woman? How ridiculous! How could a good woman seduce me? She just didn't want to be a maid anymore and deliberately seduced me to become my woman!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Too bad, she's just a cheap woman. After seducing me, she still didn't change her nature. I found out she secretly had an affair with someone else and gave birth to you, this bastard!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, of course, I had to teach her a lesson!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I didn't expose her but had people humiliate and torment you harshly, making you live in fear and pain!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Too bad, my only mistake was not killing you, this bastard! If I had known this earlier, I shouldn't have sent someone to hunt you down. I should have personally crushed you to death!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then, I would crush your soul too, leaving you no chance to enter reincarnation!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick looked disdainful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clenched his fists, furious, but he didn't know how to retort.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He closed his eyes, still unwilling to believe Frederick's words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "My mother would never be like that!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She would never willingly seduce Emperor Frederick!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She absolutely wouldn't!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne opened his eyes, filled with anger and killing intent, and roared, "Emperor Frederick, you deserve to die! You humiliated and tormented us. And now my mother is gone, yet you still slander her?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You deserve to die! Do you think I would believe your words?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I admit, what you said does sound like the truth, but you can't explain why, after executing my mother, you still had her buried in the Royal Sepulcher."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"According to you, she betrayed you. With your personality, after executing her, you would have disposed of her body anywhere! So why did you bury her in the Royal Sepulcher?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And also!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne continued coldly, "You said Queen Callista targeted my mother under your orders? That's impossible, because I know very well she targeted my mother out of jealousy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If my mother betrayed you, and you let her punish my mother, how could she possibly be jealous of my mother? She would only feel disdain and anger!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stared directly into Frederick's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, how do you explain this?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick still remained silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered, "And, you said that in the previous life, I wasn't your son. I believe that because in the previous life, I indeed had nothing in common with you! But I can be very sure that in the previous life, I was a descendant of the Royal Family!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick shrugged and finally replied, "You being a descendant of the Royal Family is quite normal because your mother's lover was a member of the Royal Family! But I've already killed him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered, "Oh really? Too bad, I don't believe it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your words are all lies! You're just trying to stall for time so your men can come and surround me, leaving me with no way to escape!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, I won't believe your words now! I'll kill you and uncover the truth from your memories, to understand what kind of woman my mother really was, and to find out who I truly was in my previous life!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He continued, "Your men are almost here, right? Too bad, they won't have the chance to surround me. If you have the skills, catch me. Otherwise, just keep chasing me from behind!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he immediately prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick instantly became furious and roared, "You damn bastard, run away? You can't escape. Die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick launched a frenzied attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, it was too late. Osborne had already vanished swiftly. Shortly after, nearly fifty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors rushed over, but their efforts were in vain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick's face was extremely grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Darling, did that bastard escape again?" Callista asked with a frown.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick nodded. "That damn bastard is quite cunning!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then are we not going after him?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista was somewhat unwilling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick sneered, "He has spatial power. Even I can only follow behind him, unable to catch up! Chasing him is just a waste of time, but he can't escape! As long as we find the secret base of the Fairy Moon Sect and capture those people, he will show up to court death!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, let's not waste time on him and continue searching for the Fairy Moon Sect's secret base!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I feel the aura of those from the Fairy Moon Sect becoming clearer. Their secret base must be nearby!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We'll find them within a day at most!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick nodded and sneered, "Then let's keep searching! By the way, have everyone form teams of ten and stop splitting up! His power is strange. If we act separately, we might be defeated by him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Got it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick gave up chasing Osborne and continued searching for the Fairy Moon Sect's secret base.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was watching from a distance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He snorted coldly and murmured, "Emperor Frederick, I will kill you and find the answers from your memories!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, he disappeared from the spot.</span></p><div class="pagination">
