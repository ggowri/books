  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne let out a cold laugh, his voice dripping with sarcasm. "Oh? So you're not planning to play by the rules anymore? You can't handle us in the arena, so you're thinking of bringing in the heavy hitters from the Paramount Supreme Clan to finish us off?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caesar caught the mockery in Osborne's tone but shrugged it off with a smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And what of it? In this world, history is written by the victors! Once you're dead, who's going to care about who won in the arena?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're nothing but lowly members of the Human Community, while I was born into the noble Paramount Supreme Clan! That's the gap between us! You can only hold your ground on the arena floor; outside of it, I could wipe you out without breaking a sweat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His arrogance was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle, "I have to admit, you make a valid point. But your biggest mistake was stepping onto this arena in the first place! Now, you want to escape and use outside help to kill us? It's too late for that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You won't be able to leave this arena to summon your Paramount Supreme Clan's warriors! You might as well resign yourself to dying here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caesar burst into laughter. "Hahaha! You think you can kill me in the arena?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Good luck with that! I have the Supreme Sovereign's Armor, which makes me virtually invincible. With your level of power, even if I stood still, you wouldn't be able to touch me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And you think you can stop me from leaving? Who do you think you are?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stood tall, confidence radiating from him, bolstered by the Supreme Sovereign's Armor he wore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had no doubt that Osborne wouldn't be able to breach its defenses in a short amount of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, the elders of the Paramount Supreme Clan, all at the peak of Deity King level, were watching from the sidelines. If he didn't return soon, they would surely sense something was off and intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That would spell doom for Osborne and his crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He murmured, "Let's find out if I'm worthy or not! I need to speed things up before the Paramount Supreme Clan's Deity King elders become a problem! Let's see if your Supreme Sovereign's Armor can really protect you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Osborne moved closer to Zoe. "Zoe, try attacking with your soul power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zoe nodded, her expression serious. "Got it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Supreme Sovereign's Armor was renowned for its incredible defensive capabilities, making it difficult for even peak Deity King warriors to break through in a short time. Osborne, still in the early stages of Deity King himself, knew he couldn't kill Caesar directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he also understood that every armor had its weaknesses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While the Supreme Sovereign's Armor excelled at defending against energy and physical attacks, it might not hold up against a soul attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne suspected that soul power was the chink in its armor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zoe, being a master of soul attacks, was his best bet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Osborne's soul power was vast&mdash;far exceeding Zoe's&mdash;he lacked her finesse in soul manipulation. He didn't want to act too hastily and give Caesar a reason to flee the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was why he had his Spatial Clones engage Caesar while he dealt with Tristram and the others&mdash;giving Zoe the opportunity to focus on Caesar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now was the moment to test that theory!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zoe began to chant, her voice weaving a melody that resonated deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, a beautiful sound filled Caesar's mind, and he felt himself slipping into a trance, his gaze becoming unfocused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The soul power attack was taking effect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Supreme Sovereign's Armor surrounding Caesar showed no signs of reacting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's working!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up at the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But his excitement quickly faded as he noticed Caesar snapping back to awareness just before his gaze went completely blank. Shock flickered across Caesar's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What the hell? A soul power attack?! How did they know that the Supreme Sovereign's Armor can't defend against that? Such a powerful soul attack! Even I almost fell under its influence! Thank goodness I'm at the late Deity King level, far surpassing them! Otherwise, I'd be in serious trouble today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Panic surged within him as he realized the urgency of the situation. Caesar desperately pushed to break free, ignoring the Spatial Clones that were still trying to hold him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His determination to escape was unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zoe's voice was tinged with urgency. "Osborne, there's a two-tier gap between our levels! To inflict serious damage on his Soul Current Ocean, I'll need more time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And with his soul power being so formidable, he won't give me that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned, feeling the pressure mounting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are we really going to let Caesar slip away? He's one of the Five Brilliant Scions of the Paramount Supreme Clan! Just letting him go like this is infuriating! And that Supreme Sovereign's Armor..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A sense of regret washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Zoe's soul power attack had proven ineffective against Caesar. It seemed they were running out of options to stop him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Supreme Sovereign's Armor was simply too powerful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although they knew that soul power was its Achilles' heel, Zoe's lower level meant her attack wasn't strong enough to exploit that weakness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is there really no other way?" Osborne's frustration was palpable.</span></p><div class="pagination">
