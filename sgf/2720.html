Then he joined forces with Adriana to effortlessly take down Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The battle was completely over!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne grabbed Frederick's neck and said disdainfully, "Emperor Frederick, do you have anything left to say now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick, at this moment, was like a dead dog, utterly miserable. Blood stained the corner of his mouth as he gave a wry smile and said, "You won, and I lost. I have nothing to say! I only regret not killing you and Michelle directly back then; otherwise, I wouldn't be in this situation today!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered, "So, as the loser, can you finally tell the truth? What exactly happened to my mother..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick hesitated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Callista screamed sharply, "Bastard, you want to know? Then I'll tell you. Michelle came from the deeper parts of the universe. She was fleeing! She hid her identity and took refuge in the palace of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, and ended up enchanting that scumbag Frederick!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Too bad, she didn't fancy him at all!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When she gave birth to you, he was consumed with jealousy! Then, hatred grew in him, so he made me go after you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then who is my biological father?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista sneered, "No one knows who he is! When Michelle returned from the deeper parts of the universe, she was already pregnant with you! Your biological father might be some warrior from the depths of the universe!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, her necklace is too powerful. That was a gift from your biological father! Without that necklace, Frederick would have forced himself on her long ago!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In short, if you want to find your biological father, then go to the deeper parts of the universe!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clenched his fists, feeling that Callista wasn't lying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, she no longer had any reason to lie. However, whether she was lying or not, Osborne wouldn't let her go. When the time came, he would just search her memory, and everything would become clear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took a deep breath and closed his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "So, I'm really not Emperor Frederick's son! My parents actually come from the deeper parts of the universe!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I will find you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked resolute. Then, he stared at Frederick and Callista, swiftly swinging his hand to behead them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, they died!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But their memories were captured by Osborne, sealed, and carefully examined.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In their memories, he learned more things.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Michelle indeed came from deeper in the universe. Callista was right, but she didn&rsquo;t know that Michelle was actually connected to the Royal Family, being one of them, which is why she hid among them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is also why, after her death, Frederick was willing to have her buried in the Royal Sepulcher.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Additionally, he once suspected that Michelle's remains were also taken away after Osborne's biological father dug up the tomb!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After reading Frederick and Callista's memories, Osborne opened his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everything is clear now!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne let out a long breath at this moment, turning to look at Adriana, Isa, Clarissa, and the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were also looking at him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "Almost everything on Racial Convergence Planet has been resolved, so next, I have a new plan..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What plan?" Isa asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I want to venture deeper into the universe to find my biological father and my missing mother, and also to search for the Fountain of Life for Alfreda."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was instantly shocked, their bodies trembling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Deeper into the universe? But our cultivation level hasn't reached Imperial Empyrean Sacredness. We simply can't survive in the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign. How can we venture deeper into the universe?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa frowned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't even think about leaving us behind and going alone! We don't agree! We are your women. Wherever you go, we will follow you and never be apart from you again!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No matter which corner of the universe you go to, we will follow you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa was incredibly determined.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clarissa, Emma, Austin, Adriana, Anastasia, Zoe, Kendra, and the others also nodded firmly at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes. Wherever you go, we will follow you and never be apart from you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He walked over to the women, opened his arms, and embraced them all, saying gently, "Don't worry. I won't leave you! We'll venture deeper into the universe together."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As for our cultivation level not reaching Imperial Empyrean Sacredness?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry! I have twenty sets of Inferior Imperial Artifact Armors. As long as we wear them, we can survive in the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That way, we can venture deeper into the universe!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone immediately became excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, let's prepare well for what's next! I'm planning to return to Celestara Planet for a while. Once I handle everything, we'll set off."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"One month later, we'll set off together!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The women all nodded in agreement. For them, it didn't matter where they went. Whether it was Racial Convergence Planet, Celestara Planet, Blue Planet, or deeper into the universe, as long as they could be with Osborne, that was enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Wherever he went, they followed!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So over the next month, they all got busy. Osborne returned to Celestara Planet, met his parents, Sebastian, Jethro, and others. After leaving some things behind, he departed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His parents and Sebastian did not stop him from venturing deeper into the universe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne found Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing that he was going deeper into the universe, she immediately wanted to go too, because she knew the true warriors of the Ember Phoenix Clan were there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll go with you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright!" Osborne agreed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, a month had passed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a terrifying Chrono-Spatial Turbulence appeared before Osborne and the others, surging toward an unknown place, its dreadful aura causing panic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And this was the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign, the only route to enter deeper into the universe from its edge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, are you sure it's okay?" Isa asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Don't worry. It'll be fine! No matter what, I'll protect you all!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he looked at Isa, Clarissa, Emma, Austin, Anita, Anastasia, Zoe, Kendra, Diana, Hannah, Mila, Agatha, and Bryce beside him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were his women, sisters, friends, his closest people!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most of them had accompanied him all the way from the humble Blue Planet to now, experiencing the turmoil of Celestara Planet and the conflicts of Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, they were about to accompany him deeper into the universe to explore!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne and they looked at each other.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't help but smile and said, "It's so good to have you with me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone laughed as well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath, waved his hand, and said, "Let's go! Let's explore deeper into the universe together!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's set off!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Osborne grabbed everyone's hands and walked with them into the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, their figures disappeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next time, they will appear in the vast depths of a greater universe!</span></p><div class="pagination">
