  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The knocking was loud and insistent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A woman's voice rang out from outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan, open the door! Lachlan, I know you're back! Hurry up and let me in! If you don't open up, I'll just blast through your divine power lock!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow, recognizing the voice instantly from Lachlan's memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What brings her here to look for Lachlan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned slightly but gestured to Harry and Amelia to stay back as he stepped out of the stone house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he emerged, he spotted a tall, striking figure in the courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young woman stood there, exuding an air of beauty that was unmistakable by Human Community standards. Her sharp gaze and proud demeanor hinted at her confidence&mdash;and a touch of arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw Osborne, a cold smile crept onto her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan, are you going to keep me waiting?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waved his hand to unlock the divine power lock and replied calmly, "Belinda, what brings you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda Swift was the daughter of Lachlan's uncle, Calvin, who was the only chiliarch from the Human Community in the Wild Flame Army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This connection gave Calvin considerable influence within the Swift family, and Calvin had practically secured his future as the next head of the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the years, Belinda had grown increasingly haughty, showing little respect for Lachlan despite their familial ties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was no slouch herself, having reached the Transcendent Deity level and serving as a squad leader under Calvin in the Wild Flame Army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumor had it that Calvin was already working his magic, maneuvering to advance Belinda's position within the Wild Flame Army to that of a centurion. Success on this front would have meant that Belinda's standing within the Wild Flame Army would not only skyrocket but also surpass Lachlan's own stature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Imagine this&mdash;a formidable father-daughter duo, with Calvin as a chiliarch and Belinda as a centurion, propelling their position within the Swift family to new heights, almost as if a single flower bloomed magnificently within a garden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda said coldly, "Am I not allowed to visit?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you hiding a woman in here? Hmph, I'm going to have a good look!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she strode confidently toward the stone house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne considered stopping her but ultimately decided against it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, Belinda entered the stone house and immediately spotted Harry and Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused, clearly taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well, Lachlan! So you really are hiding a woman at home! I never thought you'd finally come to your senses! Grandpa was worried you wouldn't want to marry and carry on the Swift family name, and he was planning to arrange a marriage for you. Turns out you've been sneaking around with a woman instead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mocking smile spread across her face. "Not bad! She's pretty and has a nice figure&mdash;definitely capable of giving you sons! But what's this? You're hiding a man too? I didn't know you had such tastes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her words, Amelia blushed but didn't dare to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne maintained his composure. "They're just my servants."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, he wanted nothing more than to send Belinda on her way. After all, she was technically Lachlan's cousin, and the more time he spent with her, the greater the risk of his true identity being exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly changed the subject. "What exactly do you want from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda scoffed. "You think I want to be here in this dump? If it weren't for my father sending me to get you, I wouldn't have bothered!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow. "Uncle sent you to fetch me? What's the matter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't tell me you've forgotten about Grandpa's birthday? It's in three days! You're a core member of the Swift family, so Dad wants you to come back and discuss the arrangements."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, ready to decline, but struggled to find a solid reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how he felt about it, this was Lachlan's grandfather, Walter Swift, celebrating a milestone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter was a legendary warrior, a Deity Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Walter who solidified the Swift family's standing in Wild Flame City, making them the most powerful family among the indigenous Human Community. Despite the disdain and contempt that the other races held for the natives, they dared not disrespect a Deity Overlord warrior like Walter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the time came, Lachlan would undoubtedly throw an extravagant birthday celebration, and as a core member of the Swift family, Osborne had to return to discuss the details of the event.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've delivered the message. You need to come back with me right now! Besides planning Grandpa's birthday, there are a few other matters that require your attention," Belinda insisted, her tone leaving no room for argument.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Other matters?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned. He wasn't keen on getting involved with the Swift family's affairs; he'd rather focus on leveling up his skills and climbing the ranks within the Wild Flame Army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, since he had chosen to disguise himself as Lachlan, some responsibilities were unavoidable. Osborne couldn't possibly transform everyone in the Swift family into Blood Clan members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, many of their warriors, like Walter and Calvin, were beyond his current capabilities, and making a reckless move could easily expose his true identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, just give me a moment. I'll go back with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally conceded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's hope it's not too much of a hassle! Also, I'm looking to get promoted to centurion. Maybe I can leverage the Swift family's influence for that&mdash;but will they even be willing to help me?" Osborne wondered.</span></p><div class="pagination">
