  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clone Sixty-Nine has discovered a massive, pitch-black stone embedded in the chasm's rock face. Using Satan's Eye's X-ray vision, it detected twelve brilliant crystals inside that stone. Those aren't just any crystals&mdash;they're Sacred Crystals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes flew open, his face lighting up with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he had found Sacred Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twelve of them, nestled within a stone embedded in the rock. Without Satan's Eye, he would have never spotted them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The value of a Sacred Crystal may not be as high as that of an Element Gold Crystal, but it's still incredibly significant! The energy contained within Sacred Crystals can provide a substantial boost, even for warriors at the Empyrean Sacredness level! For a Supernal Deity King, the energy is simply mind-boggling. Just one Sacred Crystal could help an ordinary Ascension Four Supernal Deity King break through to Ascension Five!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's breath quickened with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately commanded Clone Sixty-Nine to scale the chasm wall and break the dark stone to retrieve the twelve Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twelve Sacred Crystals would be more than enough to accelerate his cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he required an extraordinary amount of energy to break through, far exceeding that of his peers, those twelve crystals could at least push him to Ascension Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Breaking through to Ascension Four wasn't out of the question, either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm about to strike it rich!" Osborne exclaimed, his excitement palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clone Sixty-Nine sprang into action, racing up the rock face to shatter the massive stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a pointed gesture, Clone Sixty-Nine unleashed a surge of spatial energy around the dark stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying collapse occurred, yet the stone remained unyielding, only shedding a few tiny fragments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!" Osborne gasped in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His space elemental essence had reached the peak of Level Nine, and a full-powered Spatial Clone should have been able to obliterate an ordinary Ascension Four Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, this seemingly unremarkable black stone had only lost a bit of its surface?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a tough rock!" Osborne muttered, but he didn't panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If one attack could only chip off a little, he could keep at it&mdash;one hundred strikes, one thousand strikes&mdash;eventually, he would break that stone and retrieve the Sacred Crystals inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He instructed Clone Sixty-Nine to go all out and sent nearby Spatial Clones to assist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Alfreda's laughter rang in his ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My plant elemental essence has reached the peak of Level Nine! With just a few more Plant Gold Crystals, I can hit Level Ten! I feel stronger than ever!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda was beaming with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After over five hours, she had finally absorbed the energy from a Plant Gold Crystal, elevating her plant elemental essence to its peak, just like Osborne's space elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go! We need to keep exploring!" Alfreda waved her hand, eager to continue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment, then nodded. Even with over two hundred Spatial Clones scouting the Death Chasm, he knew he couldn't just sit idle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sooner they finished exploring the chasm, the quicker they could delve deeper into the mysteries of Umbra Earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and Alfreda set off once more. Although their party had dwindled to just the two of them, the presence of Osborne's Satan's Eye provided a significant advantage. While the Death Chasm was perilous for others, for them, it posed little threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their biggest challenge was the sheer size of the Death Chasm and the multitude of branching paths. Finding treasures relied heavily on luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a stroke of fortune, they could stumble upon valuable artifacts in any random branch they chose to explore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, if luck was against them, they might search through a dozen branches without finding a thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, their luck seemed to have run dry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps the twenty-one Element Gold Crystals they had found earlier had depleted their good fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After traversing two more branches without any discoveries, they encountered a swarm of Phantom Worms. Thankfully, Osborne sensed them in advance, and with his guidance, Alfreda took them out from a distance with swift precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh! Why is it that we keep coming up empty?" Alfreda exclaimed, frustration creeping into her voice as they reached the end of yet another barren branch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This marked their sixth branch explored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been in Umbra Earth for two days now, and aside from their initial find of Element Gold Crystal, they hadn't uncovered anything else&mdash;at least, that's how it felt to Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, while also not making any personal finds, had been raking in the rewards through his Spatial Clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clone One Hundred Fifty-Six had discovered fifteen Element Gold Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clone Seventy-Five had found nine, while Clone Two Hundred Eight had unearthed twenty-seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clone Eight had come across seventeen, and Clone Ninety-Five had managed a remarkable thirty-seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clone One Hundred Twenty-Five had found twenty-five, and so on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of over two hundred Spatial Clones, about ten percent had returned with treasures, most of which were Element Gold Crystals. The least successful had found nine, while the most successful had snagged thirty-seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just two short days, these twenty-plus Spatial Clones had amassed a staggering total of over four hundred eighty Element Gold Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Osborne appeared to be exploring the Death Chasm alongside Alfreda, most of his focus was on his clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every so often, one would report a find, sending waves of excitement through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what thrilled Osborne the most was that after a relentless day of blasting away at the dark stone, Clone Sixty-Nine had finally cracked it open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside lay the twelve Sacred Crystals, now safely retrieved!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sacred Crystals were in his grasp!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was ecstatic. While Element Gold Crystals were indeed precious&mdash;worth at least five Sacred Crystals in Elf City&mdash;what he truly needed right now were the Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cultivation level was too low, and he was eager to rise in power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His most pressing need was not just an increase in elemental essence but a significant boost to his cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the vast expanse of the chasm, Element Gold Crystals were abundant; they had found nearly five hundred in two days. However, the twelve Sacred Crystals were a rare treasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The twelve Sacred Crystals were now stored safely in his Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne sensed the overwhelming, pure energy radiating from them, his breath quickened with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's take a breather!" he quickly told Alfreda before settling down cross-legged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Infinite Devouring Eyes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he summoned the Infinite Devouring Eyes from the Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then began feeding the twelve Sacred Crystals into the Infinite Devouring Eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, a massive surge of energy flowed into him as the Eyes absorbed and refined the crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's cultivation level began to rise rapidly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
