  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Gerald was extremely anxious, shouting desperately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After entering the center of the glacier area, Magma Devourer's strength was greatly suppressed. They finally found an opportunity to severely wound the Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But even so, they still couldn't kill the Magma Devourer. Instead, the severely injured Magma Devourer suddenly unleashed its strength and killed more than a dozen judges.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, only about forty judges were left around.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This loss was truly immense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the chief judge, Gerald couldn't allow the Magma Devourer to escape. He had to personally kill the Magma Devourer to avenge his companions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the severely injured Magma Devourer suddenly became smarter. It no longer fought recklessly with them but chose to use all its strength to escape.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In such a situation, the Magma Devourer quickly left the glacier area and frantically rushed toward the volcanic region.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After entering the volcanic region, its injuries might not heal, but its strength would undoubtedly grow. Moreover, it could continuously draw power from the volcano. In that case, it would be much harder for them to kill the Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop it! We can't let it leave the glacier area. We must kill it here." With that, Gerald began attacking furiously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he couldn't stop it at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although the Magma Devourer was severely injured and its strength greatly reduced, its defense remained incredibly strong. Moreover, Gerald was also injured, so he couldn't stop the Magma Devourer at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although the Magma Devourer's injuries kept worsening, it was getting closer to the volcanic region.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the Magma Devourer let out a roar, as it had already spotted the volcanic region, its massive eyes filled with excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It used all its strength, directly knocking Gerald and the other judges aside with its massive body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Gerald coughed up blood again. He felt like his body was about to fall apart, his eyes filled with helplessness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Norton, we can't stop it," the other judges said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their eyes were also filled with unwillingness, but they had no choice but to watch as the Magma Devourer quickly rushed out of the glacier region and into the volcanic area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, they felt the Magma Devourer's aura grow much stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although the Magma Devourer was very weak compared to its peak strength, the judges were equally exhausted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, stop." Though unwilling, Gerald finally waved his hand, signaling everyone to stop.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Norton, aren't we going after it? It killed so many of us. Aren't we going to avenge them?" someone shouted unwillingly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald gritted his teeth and said, "Revenge? I want revenge too. But with our current strength and situation, we simply can't kill the Magma Devourer in the volcanic area. Its defense is too strong."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If we recklessly enter the volcanic area to deal with the Magma Devourer, we'll all be in danger and might even be completely wiped out by it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, everyone else fell silent because they all knew Gerald was right. In the glacier region, they were only able to injure the Magma Devourer because its strength was suppressed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the volcanic area is the Magma Devourer's home turf. There, its power will be even stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Given their current situation, they could really all be killed by the Magma Devourer in the volcanic area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are we not going to kill it?" another arbiter asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald shook his head. "Of course, we have to kill it. And the Magma Devourer is doomed. Support from the Glorious Divine Kingdom will arrive soon. By then, someone will definitely take it down."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Unfortunately, we can't kill it ourselves anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald's eyes were filled with killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had already received the news that the Glorious Divine Kingdom had dispatched a rescue team led by a warrior at the Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection level. They were teleported to a nearby resource-bearing planet and were now crossing the void, heading this way.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald calculated the time and knew they would arrive by tomorrow at the latest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once the warrior at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection arrives, no matter how strong the Magma Devourer is, even if it's uninjured and at its peak, it will surely be killed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald swore in his heart. "Tomorrow! Tomorrow will be the day this beast dies. By then, I will beg the warrior at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection to let me personally kill the Magma Devourer."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We'd better find a place to recover first. The Magma Devourer is seriously injured and will definitely need to recuperate after returning. It won't cause trouble for a while."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The contestants are safe. We can finally relax." With that, Gerald left with the remaining judges.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, what they didn't notice was that far away, Osborne was riding on Flash's back, excitedly watching the Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was overjoyed, thinking, "Here's my chance! Although the Magma Devourer isn't dead, it's already seriously injured. It's in bad shape. If it hadn't quickly escaped back to the volcanic area, it would probably have been killed by the judges soon."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, this is good. If the Magma Devourer had been killed by the judges, I wouldn't get anything. Now, it's my turn to act."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne ordered Flash, "Let's chase after it now. We can't give the Magma Devourer time to recover. Today, we must kill it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes were filled with killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, what are we doing? Don't get too close to the Magma Devourer. We're already very close to it," Clara said worriedly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "It's fine. I'm chasing the Magma Devourer. It's already seriously injured. This is the best chance to kill it. If I miss this, it might not be my turn anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Osborne's words, Clara widened her eyes and looked at Osborne in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy was stunned too. "What did you say? You're going to chase the Magma Devourer and kill it? Osborne, don't act impulsively."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Clara and Leroy both felt that Osborne was too crazy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That's the Magma Devourer!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each of them knew how terrifying the strength of the Magma Devourer was. Gerald, at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, had already led over a hundred advanced Empyrean Sacredness judges to besiege the Magma Devourer for three or four days. However, not only did they fail to kill the Magma Devourer, but nearly two-thirds of the judges died, and even Gerald was seriously injured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although the Magma Devourer is now seriously injured and much weaker than before, it is still not something they can handle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gerald and the other judges had already given up and didn't dare to chase the Magma Devourer into the volcanic area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In such a situation, Osborne actually wanted to chase after it and kill the Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Both of them thought Osborne was crazy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, stop!" Clara and Leroy were both very worried.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne didn't slow Flash down. At this moment, Flash was also very excited. Flash had long wanted to fight the Magma Devourer. With Osborne's permission, Flash gave it his all, wildly chasing after the Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, stop! We're courting death!" Clara shouted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne comforted, "Don't worry. I'm not courting death. I've been planning to kill the Magma Devourer for many days. I've finally waited for this chance."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can't miss this. The Magma Devourer is full of treasures. I absolutely can't let it return to the center of the volcanic area. Otherwise, it will be even harder to deal with."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hold on tight. I need to catch up with the Magma Devourer first."</span></p><div class="pagination">
