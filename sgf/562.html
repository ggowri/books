  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam didn't want to waste any more time. After all, Rodney was nearby and could arrive at any moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wanted to finish off Osborne quickly and claim the Heir's Emblem.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Sam unleashed his power, his massive body began to swell rapidly, like a balloon being inflated. His 6-foot frame transformed into a towering figure over 16 feet tall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No, he was not just a giant, but he became a massive bear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thick fur sprouted from his exposed skin, his fingers extended into sharp claws, and even his facial features morphed into those of a fearsome, snarling bear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Watching Sam's transformation, Osborne couldn't help but feel a wave of surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam was the most complete shape-shifting metahuman Osborne had ever seen. And now, there was no trace of his human form, and he looked like a real berserk bear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ha! Are you scared?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam's voice had changed, too, now deep and guttural like a beast's roar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll give you one last chance, hand over the Heir's Emblem, and I'll go easy on you. Otherwise, I'll break every bone in your body."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne let out a cold snort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Enough talk. If you want to fight, then fight. If you think I'll just hand over the Heir's Emblem, you're dreaming!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then you're asking for death!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam roared and charged at Osborne, his speed even greater than before. His massive arm swung down toward Osborne, creating a deafening boom in the air even before it landed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's expression grew serious as he threw a punch of his own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ninefold Tide Crash!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, Osborne was sent flying, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth as he crashed through several ancient trees before finally coming to a stop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Sam hadn't even been pushed back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What incredible strength!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What incredible defense!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne wiped the blood from his mouth, and his expression grew even more grave. After transforming into the ancient berserk bear, Sam's strength had at least doubled, and his defense had increased severalfold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even with the Ninefold Tide Crash, Osborne couldn't harm Sam at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're too weak!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam sneered. "Your strength may be impressive to others, but to me, it's nothing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now, it's time to keep my promise and break your limbs!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Sam charged at Osborne again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne didn't try to meet him head-on this time and instead chose to dodge. But Sam's speed was just as terrifying as his strength and defense, and with over thirty of his men surrounding them, Osborne had little room to maneuver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam's attacks shattered everything in his path, and nothing could withstand his blows. He was like an enraged T-Rex, destroying everything in his way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It seems I have no choice but to reveal more of my trump cards!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's expression turned cold and resolute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew that if things continued this way, he would never be able to defeat Sam. Sam was a Class AA martial artist with a transformational power that greatly enhanced his strength, far beyond what Osborne could handle in his normal state.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In that case, he had only one option left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had to transform!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're not the only one who can transform!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne murmured, tapping into the power of his Blood Cross, and his body began to change rapidly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A terrifying power surged through him as his short hair grew wildly, transforming into a cascade of long, flowing locks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Each strand turned blood-red, like flowing blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sharp fangs appeared in his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His fingers grew into long, dagger-like claws.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even his face became paler and more angular.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A vampire!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne had transformed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After transforming into a vampire, Osborne's body didn't grow larger, but his strength and speed increased dramatically, rivaling that of Sam's ancient berserk bear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon seeing this, Sam's expression turned serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't expect you to have a trump card like this! Are you a shape-shifting metahuman, too? I underestimated you!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But even so, you'll still lose!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Sam unleashed another punch, the immense force seemingly powerful enough to shatter the frozen space around them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's expression shifted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This guy wasn't even using his full strength earlier! But now, I'm not the same either!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne responded with a punch of his own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, both Osborne and Sam were forced to retreat rapidly. Each took about ten steps back before finally coming to a stop. In terms of sheer power, they were evenly matched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This outcome left Sam stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was the first time he had encountered someone from the younger generation who could match him in strength. The realization left him momentarily shaken, and the confidence on his face wavered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then his expression twisted into one of rage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't believe it! I don't believe you can compare to me! Even if your strength matches mine, you can't possibly break through my defense! My greatest strength is my defense!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The same attack may not affect me, but when I hit you, I can still injure you!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There's no way I can lose!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Sam charged at Osborne again, determined to test who could endure longer in this battle of strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Osborne simply smirked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really? You think your defense is that strong? I'm not so sure!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Osborne unleashed a punch</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This time, he used his Point Blank Force!</p><div class="pagination">
