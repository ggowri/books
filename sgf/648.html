  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne returned to the Augustine Estate neighborhood after several interdimensional travels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used his earth elemental power to sink into the soil and control the energy fluctuations to approach the villa where Clarissa was in seclusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took him a long time before he finally arrived nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened his Satan's Eyes, seeing Clarissa with her eyes closed, working on her Class A breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It should be successful soon. In a few days, Clarissa will likely break through Class A. The energy around her is very strong. She might achieve more than just that," Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't act carelessly now. Duke Medusa will surely set a trap for me. My current strength isn't enough to confront a Class AAA like her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I must continue to improve my strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes burned with the desire for strength. The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' power exceeded his expectations, and with his current power, he could only engage in minor skirmishes, risking danger if he wasn't careful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strength was far from being able to determine the direction of the war.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, he needed to be stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided to stay here, protecting Clarissa while improving his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first thing he had to do was to fuse the Devil's Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had consumed nine elemental essences but had only fused seven into the Devil's Light, leaving the dark and light elemental essences to integrate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously hesitant about the fusion process due to concerns about his body's capacity, now, he felt confident at Class AA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get started!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The next time we meet, I hope to have the strength to fight Duke Medusa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, he began to integrate the Devil's Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He started with the dark Elemental essence. The fusion went smoothly, transforming his light blue Devil's Light into a light purple hue, seventh-level Devil's Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt significantly stronger but was still unsatisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Continue fusing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Light elemental essence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was a little hesitant about whether to integrate the light elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because it was given by Isa, and its origin is unknown. But, compared to other element essences, the light element essence was much more powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He worried that integrating it would put greater pressure on his body, and he didn't know if he could withstand it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimately, he decided to proceed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the seventh level of Devil's Light providing a considerable boost, it still wasn't enough to confront Duke Medusa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He must be stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go for it! The more powerful the light elemental essence, the greater my Devil's Light will be after fusion, enabling me to impact the battlefield significantly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking about it, Osborne no longer hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He adjusted his state to its peak and began the fusion with the light elemental power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>, Owen stood in the Draco Group headquarters conference room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His three sneak attack squads had left the headquarters for some time. According to the plan, they were almost at the destination and would attack the three rare metal mining areas in </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> at the same time in half an hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So far, there had been no bad news, and everything was going smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A confident smile spread across Owen's face as he checked the points ranking in the Draco Star Wristlet, only to be shocked to find Osborne had surpassed him, pushing him to second last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, that jerk! He added another five hundred and forty points!" Owen fumed, unable to accept that someone he looked down on had outperformed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he couldn't accept even more was that he was actually ranked second from the bottom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his anger quickly turned to elation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Another five hundred and forty points? It seems Osborne stole from another rare </span><span>metal mine, gaining five hundred points, and killed four Class A members of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> for an additional forty!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This confirms that the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' defenses at these mines aren't strong! With two Class AA leaders and five Class As members in each of the three sneak attack squads, we will easily reclaim all three rare metal mining areas!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
