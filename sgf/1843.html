  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you. I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt's fury flared, and he lunged at Osborne, but his friends quickly intervened, desperately trying to calm him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their efforts, Kurt's rage was palpable, his eyes bloodshot and fixed on Osborne as if he could devour him whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, was unfazed. He leaned into the provocation even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Silence!" Suddenly, a commanding voice rang out, drowning the room in a heavy silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere shifted as an immense pressure enveloped everyone present, urging them to keep their composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The authoritative voice continued, leaving no room for argument, "If anyone dares to provoke again, they'll be expelled immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a twinge of disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "What a shame, Kurt didn't take the bait. I was hoping to witness a Supernal Deity King in action."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He subtly cast a glance to his right&mdash;a blank wall stood there&mdash;but beneath it lay a hidden observer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind that wall, an elderly man sat calmly sipping coffee, watching the exchange between Osborne and Kurt with a detached interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Above him, there was no Divine Flame. Only Osborne's unique ability, his Satan's Eye, could perceive the ethereal staircase shimmering dimly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ascension Stairway!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This man was a Supernal Deity King, albeit one of the Ascension One variety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's malicious taunting had two motives. Part of him genuinely loathed Kurt and wanted to get under his skin, but deeper down, Osborne hoped to incite Kurt into striking first. If Kurt acted out, he could be punished by the Sanctum of Light, and perhaps the Supernal Deity King lurking behind the wall would intervene personally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That would give Osborne a rare opportunity to measure the might of an Ascension One Supernal Deity King firsthand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regrettably for him, Kurt held his ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warning from the Supernal Deity King dampened Osborne's spirits about provoking Kurt further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no intention of experiencing the full power of a Supernal Deity King firsthand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere in the room had shifted to a profound silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the Luminous Commerce Center understood the stakes. A Supernal Deity King keeping watch meant even Kurt had to tread carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shot one last furious glare at Osborne, mouth moving silently as Osborne caught the words "Just wait!" forming on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cool smile, Osborne mirrored him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Coward!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt's face flushed crimson, and he felt the anger bubbling up again, itching to burst free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he held himself back, refusing to give Osborne the satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dealing with someone like Osborne, who seemed to have no fear of his identity or background, was proving to be a real headache for Kurt. After all, this was the Luminous Commerce Center, the jewel in the crown of the Sanctum of Light's empire. No matter how brazen he was, he dared not make a move here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he buried his murderous intent deep within, biding his time until Osborne left, at which point he planned to eliminate Osborne without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the voice of the Supernal Deity King broke through the tension again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Miracle Elixir auction is now beginning! There are ten Miracle Elixirs available! Among them, four red Miracle Elixirs, one yellow Miracle Elixir, two blue ones, two white ones, and one black Miracle Elixir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As these words echoed in the air, a raised platform materialized before them, encased in a shimmering divine energy barrier. Upon it rested the ten vibrant Miracle Elixirs, glowing with an alluring brilliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the attendees laid eyes on the elixirs, anticipation sparked in the air. Their gazes turned greedy, fixated on the treasures before them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Kurt's attention drifted away from Osborne, his focus laser-sharp on the elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Osborne, however, it was just another day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked on with an air of calm indifference. Miracle Elixirs were nothing new to him. He had seen plenty in his time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Kurt's arrogant provocations, Osborne wouldn't have bothered showing up at all. The Miracle Elixirs held little interest for him&mdash;just ten elixirs? Hardly worth his time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he pondered this, Osborne felt someone settle into the seat beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to find Tristan, a familiar face, and offered a slight smile in greeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan's eyes sparkled with curiosity as he regarded Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had witnessed the earlier confrontation with Kurt and felt a surge of satisfaction watching Kurt squirm. The way Osborne had stood up to him only increased Tristan's admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief hesitation, Tristan slid into the seat next to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey there, I'm Tristan from the Hudson family. What's your name?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne returned the smile, keeping his tone casual. "I'm Theodore Augustine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he remained disguised as the youthful version of his father, Theodore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Theodore?!" Tristan blinked in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The name struck a chord with him, but he couldn't quite place it. It felt oddly familiar, yet he couldn't recall where he'd heard it before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing Tristan's puzzled expression, Osborne didn't think much of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The distance between the West Zone and East Zone was vast, and the exploits of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings in the East Zone hadn't made it back to the West Zone yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made sense that Tristan wouldn't recognize the name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne studied Tristan for a moment, feeling a strange affinity toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was because his mother also bore the Hudson surname.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, are you here to buy a Miracle Elixir?" Osborne asked, breaking the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan nodded eagerly. "Yeah! I'm here for the white Miracle Elixir. My father's injured, and he really needs it. But with Kurt around, I might not get the chance."</span></p><div class="pagination">
