  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ascending Sacred Sanctum, which looked as flimsy as a small cottage, effortlessly smashed the massive Malevolence Tower into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence was completely caught off guard. The impact shattered his brief moment of hope and sent him plummeting to the ground, spitting out mouthfuls of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers were so shocked that they stood still, their jaws dropping in utter disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like watching a puny little rabbit charge at and take down a mighty, muscular tiger in one fell swoop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who could have ever imagined such a turn of events?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes were fixed on the ruins of the Malevolence Tower, and a stunned silence fell over the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew the tower's reputation well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If there was a list of the top ten Apex divine artifacts on Celestara Planet, the Malevolence Tower would undoubtedly top the list, with the Sanctum of Night coming in a close second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, this once-invincible artifact now lay in ruins, destroyed by Osborne's shabby-looking Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa..." Isa gasped, her eyes widening as she had a sudden realization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's definitely something special about Osborne's temple! Could it be... a quasi-Sacred Artifact?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa and the others all nodded simultaneously, their faces filled with a sense of urgency. "It's definitely at least a quasi-Sacred Artifact! It might even be a full-fledged Sacred Artifact! I mean, something that can smash the Malevolence Tower to bits like that must be of a Sacred Artifact we've never even dreamed of."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they talked, a cold shiver ran down their spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of a Sacred Artifact in the form of a palace sent shockwaves through the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They understood the consequences only too well. Even though they'd never left Celestara Planet, they knew exactly what a Sacred Artifact palace meant. If the news got out, they'd be in deep trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There'd be a tidal wave of chaos and greed, and it might even attract the attention of the powerful Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quick! We have to keep this a secret!" Isa shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when they looked at the huge crowds of spectators, billions upon billions of them, a feeling of helplessness washed over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could they possibly make all these people keep quiet?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are we seriously going to kill them all?" Clarissa said, her voice laced with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massacre was something no one could bring themselves to do, no matter how high the stakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can only take it one step at a time," Isa said, steeling herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the earth erupted, and Lord Malevolence violently emerged from the debris, his figure a pitiful sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart ached as he stared at the remains of Malevolence Tower, blood continuing to drip from his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it wasn't just heartbreak he felt; fear coursed through him. He fixed his wide eyes on the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, trembling with awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Isa and Clarissa had pieced together the significance, Lord Malevolence had no trouble understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting his teeth, he exclaimed, "A Sacred Artifact?! You possess a Sacred Artifact palace?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained silent, his brow furrowed in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Lord Malevolence didn't need a confirmation from Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His smile turned sinister, a grim reality dawning upon him. "I never imagined you'd come into possession of a Sacred Artifact palace! Even in its dilapidated state, it still vastly outperforms my Malevolence Tower. It exceeds any mere quasi-Sacred Artifact! Hahaha, I guess I can't argue with fate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair flickered in his eyes as he took in the destruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew the truth&mdash;he was defeated. In the face of Osborne's Sacred Artifact palace, all his cunning strategies appeared foolish and futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had lost!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only had Malevolence Tower fallen, but with it went any hope of escape. There was no retreat to safety, no chance to find a new beginning after this catastrophic defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence understood that Osborne wouldn't let him slip away this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes blazed with madness as he snarled, "Osborne! God of Night! You're cursed! You've ruined everything for me! You'll never rest in peace!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even in death, I, Zayne, will make sure you suffer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, his body began to swell monstrously, unleashing a terrifying surge of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll take the entire Celestara Planet with me to the grave!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even in death, I'll make you live forever in regret!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Self-destruction!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The explosion roared to life, unfolding at a speed no one could anticipate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence's sudden decision to self-destruct left no time for anyone to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King, the sheer force of his self-destruction was apocalyptic. It could easily annihilate half of the Celestara Planet, turning it into a desolate wasteland.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People within a radius of tens of millions of miles would perish under the onslaught of his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers watched in horror as Lord Malevolence's body expanded uncontrollably, his power erupting like a volcanic explosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faces turned pale, and terror filled every pair of eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The esteemed Lord Malevolence, please don't!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My lord, we've always been loyal to you! Even if you've fallen, don't take us with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! Please stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Make it end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless voices pleaded with him to halt the destruction, but Lord Malevolence ignored them, his twisted grin widening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! You'll regret this! You'll live with the guilt of killing them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let everyone burn with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground trembled as his body exploded, unleashing a wave of devastating energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face twisted in grim realization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't anticipated this. Even he wasn't sure he could endure the full force of the blast without injury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone here was at risk. With a terrifying certainty, he realized that at least a significant number would suffer severe injuries, and most wouldn't survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was no ordinary catastrophe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Alliance alone contained ten billion souls, while the Dark Deity Legion boasted nearly fifty billion. To make matters worse, just a stone's throw away lay Peaks City, one of the ten major cities in the West Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within those bustling streets lived over 100 billion innocent people from the Human Community! Even they could meet their end in Lord Malevolence's catastrophic explosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Osborne's heart raced with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no time to back down or hide from this disaster. Without a moment's hesitation, he charged toward Lord Malevolence, heading straight for the explosive core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew, deep down, that only he could stop this cataclysm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only he could save the countless around him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that resolve in his heart, Osborne surged forward, racing into the heart of the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, have you lost your mind?" Isa shouted, her voice trembling with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne didn't look back. With a fierce determination burning in his eyes, he pushed his speed to the limit, reaching the core of the blast in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming energy seared his body, but he stood firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bellowed, "Second form! Absolute defense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, his body transformed into his second form&mdash;a colossal crimson lotus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its massive petals enveloped the explosive force, containing the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the shockwave from Lord Malevolence's self-detonation rippled outwards.</span></p><div class="pagination">
