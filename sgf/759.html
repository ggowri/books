  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once Roger was gone, the crowd erupted into chatter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No way, he actually took down Roger!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But he's just at Class AA! How did he pull that off?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I heard Roger once assassinated someone from the Godson Rankings! Even if it was a lower-ranked person, that's still crazy impressive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And this guy managed to beat him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone was staring at Osborne in shock, though some were less impressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He just got lucky. His sixth sense happened to counter Roger's Stealth Arts. Doesn't mean he's actually strong."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Exactly, he's nothing special. Any one of us could take him down, no sweat."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, he just got lucky and happened to counter Roger. It doesn't mean he's got real skill."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I fought him, I'd beat him in three moves!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne heard the chatter but didn't care. He calmly walked off the stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart and Vivian were both staring at him, stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had thought Osborne was walking into a death sentence, never expecting him to actually hold his own against Roger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart's expression was complicated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was grateful to Osborne for saving his life, but seeing how easily Osborne handled Roger left him feeling pretty down about his own abilities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you okay, Axell?" Vivian asked, concerned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled casually. "Do I look like I'm hurt? I haven't even warmed up yet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivian was taken aback, surprised by his relaxed attitude.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anyway, thanks for what you did today," she said earnestly. "Stuart might be too shy to say it, so I'll thank you for him. If it wasn't for you, he'd be a goner."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne shrugged it off with a smile. "No need to thank me. But we should head back. We need to figure out why Roger was after Stuart and the Lambert family. I've got a bad feeling that Eityreia Organization isn't done with us yet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His words made both Stuart and Vivian's expressions turn serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The four of them didn't linger and quickly made their way back to the villa. When they told Aleena and Rhett what had happened, both of their faces darkened with a mix of fear and relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aleena turned to Osborne, speaking sincerely, "Axell, thank you for what you did today! If it weren't for you, Stuart would be dead, and our family would've suffered a huge loss."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled lightly. "No need to thank me. The Lambert family has helped me too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They exchanged a knowing look but didn't say anything further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aleena then looked at Rhett.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Rhett, do you know why Roger targeted Stuart and our family? You're the only one who's been out and about these past years. Did you offend Eityreia Organization assassins?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett furrowed his brow, deep in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, his expression changed. "Could it be because of her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do you mean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett took a deep breath and began, "Aleena, I didn't offend Eityreia Organization. I've always been careful when I left the Lambert family, just as you all instructed. There's no way I would deliberately provoke people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Eityreia Organization is the world's top assassin organization. I never had any contact with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But... about six months ago, I saved someone. It was a woman, and she was being hunted down, covered in blood. I couldn't just leave her there, so I stepped in and stopped the assassin chasing her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Could that assassin have been from Eityreia Organization? Did I inadvertently make an enemy of them by saving her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett's face was grave as he finished speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aleena sighed deeply. "It seems that's exactly what happened. The woman you saved must have been someone very important to Eityreia Organization, and by interfering, you ruined their plans. That's why they're coming after Stuart now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her face was filled with worry as she spoke, the tension in the room growing thicker.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is ridiculous!" Stuart burst out angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just because Rhett saved someone from their hit, they're targeting our entire family? We're not just some pushover clan. They think they can bully us like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett looked apologetic. "Aleena, Stuart, this is all my fault. If I hadn't interfered, we wouldn't be in this mess with Eityreia Organization, and the Lambert family wouldn't be in such danger."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aleena waved off his apology. "It's not your fault. You did the right thing. What matters now is figuring out how to resolve this feud with the Eityreia Organization.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"They're ruthless killers. If they've set their sights on us, our family's centuries of peaceful existence might be coming to an end."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her words left everyone in the room deeply troubled, each of them lost in their own thoughts.</p><div class="pagination">
