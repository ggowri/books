  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The colossal offshoot of the World Tree loomed at the heart of this vibrant world, its massive roots bursting from the earth and reaching skyward, vanishing into the void above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These immense roots stood side by side like a fortress wall, encasing the World Tree in an impenetrable embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was simply awe-inspiring&mdash;huge didn't even begin to cover it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne now understood why Primordial's tree, at just a few thousand yards, was still considered a sapling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The offshoot before him towered at least hundreds of thousands of yards, its canopy casting a shadow over a vast expanse of 60 miles. Each root was so massive that it would take thousands of people to encircle just one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer scale was terrifying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In comparison, Primordial was little more than a twig.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a surge of anxiety, but he noticed that the World Tree offshoot remained eerily still, seemingly oblivious to his intrusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of relief washed over him, but thoughts of Creation Herald quickly turned his relief into rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Creation Herald, you think you can pull a fast one on me? Just wait until I get out of here alive&mdash;I swear I'll make you pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression darkened as he glanced at his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stuck firmly in his hand was the blood-red orb, pulsating with chaotic energy. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't shake it off; it felt like it was glued to him, ready to explode at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bloodstrike Orb!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This orb was Creation Herald's ace in the hole against the World Tree offshoot. If it detonated, the resulting force would be catastrophic, obliterating both the tree and Osborne in the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity's immortality save him? Osborne had no idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperate, he called out to Primordial in the depths of his soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Primordial, Creation Herald really does have a hidden agenda! What do we do now? Can you help with this Bloodstrike Orb?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's voice came through, calm yet urgent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on! Let me think for a moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a pause, Primordial continued, "I don't have any information on the Bloodstrike Orb in my memory banks! Creation Herald wasn't lying about it&mdash;this orb is likely a genuine artifact from the Umbra World!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The explosion will definitely be too much for your body to withstand! Not even the Bloodwrought Armor can protect you! And the immortality granted by the Lotus won't save you either!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a wave of panic. "Not even immortality? What good is that? You need to come up with a plan fast! If I die, you'll be toast too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial chuckled softly, "Don't worry! This Bloodstrike Orb isn't just a disaster waiting to happen; it could actually work in our favor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne blinked, momentarily stunned. "Are you out of your mind?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that orb explodes, we're both done for! I can feel it&mdash;it's going to blow in less than a minute! How can you say it's a good thing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial urged, "Just listen! Yes, the Bloodstrike Orb is powerful and will explode in a minute, but we have options!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right now, you need to do exactly as I say."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded quickly, his mind racing. "What's the plan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Use your time power to cast Temporal Stasis on the Bloodstrike Orb!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Temporal Stasis?!" Osborne's eyes widened in realization, his expression shifting from panic to excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did I forget about that? I have time power! If I can cast Temporal Stasis around the Bloodstrike Orb, it won't ever explode!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Primordial, good idea, huh? I mean, you're just a tree, how did you get so smart?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial rolled his metaphorical eyes. "I'm not just any tree, you know. I'm an offshoot of the World Tree, one of the most advanced beings in this world! And let's be real, it's not so much about my brilliance&mdash;it's you panicking that got us here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a bit sheepish but didn't dwell on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly focused, channeling his time power to cast Temporal Stasis around the Bloodstrike Orb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, he sensed the chaotic energy of the orb stabilize, the imminent threat of explosion fading away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smirk crept onto his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Creation Herald, you never saw this coming, did you? You thought your Bloodstrike Orb would be my doom, but now it's just a paperweight! Once I'm out of here, I'll make sure you pay for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Primordial, his excitement tempered by concern. "But what now? This World Tree offshoot seems to be in some kind of stasis."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial took a moment to respond, considering the situation, "This is the Eighth World Tree offshoot, the weakest one besides me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right now, it's fully focused on battling Creation Herald, which is why it's in this dormant state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is our chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in disbelief. "The Eighth World Tree offshoot? And it's the weakest? If this one is so powerful, I can't imagine how strong the earlier offshoots must be!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but marvel at the sheer scale of it all. "So, do we strike now? If we deal a heavy blow to its core, you can absorb its power, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial shook his head. "No, we can't do that! Osborne, are you itching for revenge right away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely! How do we do it?" Osborne asked eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial grinned and said, "It's quite simple! I've sensed the location where Creation Herald is battling the Eighth World Tree offshoot. If we can get the Bloodstrike Orb to their battlefield, it'll blow up, severely injuring both Creation Herald and the offshoot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's even a chance they could be killed outright!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up, but then he frowned. "That sounds great, but how do we get the Bloodstrike Orb there? It's stuck to my hand, and I can't just pull it off! I'd have to chop my hand off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial chuckled, "You're not as dense as I thought!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! You just need to sacrifice that hand. You've got immortality, so losing a hand is a minor setback. Leave the delivery of the Bloodstrike Orb to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's confidence was infectious, but Osborne felt a twinge of hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet he knew this was the best course of action. Losing a hand wasn't the worst thing that could happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce glint in his eyes, Osborne nodded. "Alright, let's do it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Creation Herald thinks he can use the Bloodstrike Orb against me? Well, I'll turn the tables and use it against him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a flash of light erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's right hand was severed in an instant, but almost immediately, fresh tissue began to sprout from his arm, quickly forming a new hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, Primordial's roots emerged from the void, wrapping around Osborne's severed hand and the Bloodstrike Orb nestled within it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, just leave the rest to me!" Primordial declared, his voice filled with determination.</span></p><div class="pagination">
