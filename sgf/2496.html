  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help frowning, feeling a bit displeased.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The old man, named Dexter Jaeckel from Cobalt Island, appeared extremely domineering in front of them. He was polite at first, but as soon as he realized Osborne and his friends seemed unwilling to provide resources, he immediately turned aggressive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they provided resources, Dexter would allow them to stay and use the resources together once the Cosmic Translocator was repaired. Otherwise, he would make them leave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne suppressed his anger and didn't </span><span>lash out</span><span> immediately. After all, Dexter was an advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior, and he had five companions at the same level, who were also watching them coldly from a distance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If </span><span>a fight broke out</span><span>, Osborne </span><span>knew he </span><span>would have a hard time gaining the upper hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela stepped forward and said, "We were just curious, that's all. Besides, the items on this list are indeed a bit ridiculous. The Cosmic Translocator is</span><span> </span><span>damaged and needs repairs, not a complete rebuild. Why would it require so many resources?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"These resources are more than enough to build a Cosmic Translocator</span><span> from scratch</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dexter immediately frowned and said coldly, "Cut the nonsense. You talk as if you know how to build a Cosmic Translocator. If you're that capable, go build one yourself. </span><span>Either way</span><span>, </span><span>these</span><span> resources and materials</span><span> are required</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone else has already handed over the resources</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>Y</span><span>ou are </span><span>the only ones </span><span>left."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll say it again, if you don't hand them over, then leave."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dexter became more assertive, looking at Angela with disdain. He seemed certain that Angela and the other two couldn't possibly know how to repair the Cosmic Translocator, let alone rebuild it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the technology to build and repair a Cosmic Translocator </span><span>was exclusive to</span><span> those long-established, powerful First-rate Powers, or even Top-tier Powers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But how could people </span><span>with</span><span> such powers easily venture into the dangerous and chaotic Stellar Region M72?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela was also furious but kept it </span><span>in check</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She exchanged a glance with Osborne and quickly communicated through Telepathy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, we've encountered robbers. However, they</span><span> did </span><span>not directly loot us. But I suspect that the</span><span>y </span><span>deliberately damaged</span><span> the </span><span>Cosmic Translocator, and now they're using </span><span>its</span><span> repair </span><span>as an excuse</span><span> to</span><span> extort </span><span>resources and Sacred Crystals."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Very likely. But the</span><span>y are demanding</span><span> too much. How can they be sure we'll comply?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela thought for a moment and said, "I can't quite figure it out either. So, what do we do now? Fight them or give the resources?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly said, "No fighting. </span><span>You know how</span><span> to repair the Cosmic Translocator</span><span>, right?</span><span> Check that </span><span>damage</span><span> first. If you can fix it, everything will be </span><span>under control</span><span>, and we won't fear a conflict. Even if you can't fix it, we can't clash with them&mdash;at least not until they've repaired the Cosmic Translocator."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I</span><span> need</span><span> to save my parents, </span><span>so </span><span>I can't </span><span>afford any delays</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela nodded. "Alright, I know what to do."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After </span><span>the silent exchange</span><span> with Osborne, Angela calmly said to Dexter, "We can cover part of the resources needed to repair the Cosmic Translocator. But I need to </span><span>assess the damage first</span><span>. Besides, how can I be sure you can fix it? What if we provide the resources, and in the end, the Cosmic Translocator still isn't repaired?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dexter thought Angela was ready to back down, so his attitude softened a bit. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He nodded and said, "You want to check the Cosmic Translocator, right? Of course, no problem. As for whether it can be fixed, don't worry about that. For the deputy island master of Cobalt Island, as long as there are enough resources, repairing the Cosmic Translocator is </span><span>not a big deal</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dexter pointed at members of other factions not far away. "Besides, the people from other factions are also eager to use the Cosmic Translocator. They've contributed as many resources as you have. If it doesn't get repaired in the end, they won't let us off either."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne and Angela exchanged a glance, both surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those factions contributed </span><span>just as much</span><span>? Why? The items on that resource list</span><span> were</span><span> extremely valuable</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>These people were</span><span> clearly </span><span>being </span><span>unreasonable. Why would they agree to that?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Could it be that they're all eager to enter the depths of Stellar Region M72? D</span><span>id</span><span> they all have </span><span>something </span><span>urgent </span><span>to do</span><span>?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at those people and indeed saw a faint trace of urgency on their faces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne suddenly understood</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Something very important must be happening in the depths of Stellar Region M72. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>T</span><span>hat is why t</span><span>hese people </span><span>we</span><span>re all in a hurry to get there. So even though they kn</span><span>e</span><span>w the people from Cobalt Island </span><span>we</span><span>re extorting them, they still handed over the resources.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the people from Cobalt Island </span><span>knew it</span><span>, so they deliberately sabotaged the Cosmic Translocator to extort resources and wealth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne and Angela exchanged another glance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though they knew the people from Cobalt Island were robbing, the two didn&rsquo;t </span><span>reveal it</span><span> immediately but followed Dexter toward the Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They wanted to check the Cosmic Translocator first.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If the translocator was too severely damaged for Angela to fix, Osborne would have no choice but to hand over resources like the others</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, he couldn't waste time. He needed to head deeper into Stellar Region M72, find the Frenetic Storm Warband, rescue his parents, and return in time for the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He only had a little over five months and couldn't afford any delays.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But if Angela could repair the Cosmic Translocator, Osborne wouldn't need to hand over resources.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They want to rob him? Even if </span><span>there were</span><span> six advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors, he wo</span><span>uld</span><span>n't hold back. If they compromise</span><span>d</span><span>, everything </span><span>would</span><span> be negotiable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they d</span><span>id</span><span>n't compromise, he</span><span> would</span><span> use the Bloodwrought Bow to make them compromise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that thought, </span><span>the three had already arrived </span><span>at</span><span> the Cosmic Translocator under Dexter's lead.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela approached and carefully examined the translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>People from the other factions were also watching anxiously from a distance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing </span><span>that they did not </span><span>handover resources immediately, a young man couldn't help but shout, "You three are here for the Phantomagic Realm too, right? According to predictions, the Phantomagic Realm will appear near Inferno Planet in half a month."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We can't waste any more time, or we'll miss the Phantomagic Realm. If we miss it, we might never get a second chance in this lifetime. So, you'd better hand over the resources quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The faster </span><span>they</span><span> fix this Cosmic Translocator, the sooner we can get there."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at the young man in surprise. "Phantomagic Realm? What Phantomagic Realm?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The young man looked at Osborne in astonishment, and the others around were also incredibly surprised as they stared at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The young man asked in confusion, "You didn't come here for the Phantomagic Realm?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How is that possible? If not for the Phantomagic Realm, who would want to come to the edge of the universe? Here, apart from some low-value resource-bearing planets, there are only Space Pirates, all kinds of dangerous fugitives, and those damn bugs."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If not for the Phantomagic Realm, what are you here for?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was even more puzzled </span><span>but</span><span> politely said, "We </span><span>are not here</span><span> for the Phantomagic Realm; we have </span><span>never</span><span> heard of it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Could you explain to us what </span><span>it</span><span> is?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
