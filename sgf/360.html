  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the powerful effect of the truth serum, even if you were a Class A- metahuman, you could not resist it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These medicines from the Draco Group had never disappointed Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was also the reason why Osborne believed that the Godfather's medical lab could really cure Anastasia's strange disease and why he worked so hard to complete the heir trial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the truth serum taking effect, Osborne asked the first question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lightning elemental metahuman was blank and said unconsciously, "My name is Webster Paltrow. I am a member of The Wise Order of the Paltrow family, an ancient family in Dampston. I am also the third-generation leader of the Ghost Ship."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "It's really the Paltrow family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force behind the Ghost Ship is indeed the Paltrow family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The inherited power of the Paltrow family was lightning power. Most of the descendants of the Paltrow family had activated it, and they were hiding in the port of the Paltrow family. When Osborne saw this lightning elemental metahuman, he was almost sure that this man must be a member of the Paltrow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, it had finally been confirmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Webster, a member of The Wise Order of the Paltrow family, was actually the third-generation leader of the Ghost Ship!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this news got out, it would probably have a huge impact on the upper-class society of Dampston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the Paltrow family would definitely not admit it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't care about it. He continued to ask, "So, is the Ghost Ship actually a </span><span>force secretly established by the Paltrow family? What is your purpose in establishing the Ghost Ship?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Webster still said without hesitation, "The Ghost Ship is indeed a force established by the Paltrow family. About two hundred years ago, the Paltrow family wanted to destroy another ancient family for profit, but it was difficult to do it personally to avoid being besieged by other ancient families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, the Paltrow family quietly established the Ghost Ship and secretly wiped out that ancient family. After that, the Paltrow family retained the Ghost Ship and eliminated several more rivals within two hundred years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The purpose of establishing the Ghost Ship was to resolve rivals with conflicting interests and do things that the Paltrow family couldn't do openly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything was pretty much as he had guessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought for a moment and continued asking, "Are there other forces involved in the establishing of the Ghost Ship?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly felt that the expressions of the other three changed drastically after he asked that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They suddenly yelled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Webster, shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wake up, you bastard. Don't expose the secret of the Ghost Ship!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wake up right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shouting of the three made Osborne angry. His ocular energy turned into slaps, hitting their faces hard and making them fly away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! If you dare to yell again before I ask you anything, I'll break your bones."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne continued to look at Webster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the powerful truth serum, Webster did not wake up because of the three's shouting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Webster said without hesitation, "Yes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne became more serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me in detail."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Initially, the Ghost Ship was secretly established by the Paltrow family. Until recently, the heir of the Paltrow family, Alexander, felt that such a small scale was meaningless, so he suddenly contacted the Walker family and the Luther family, the other two ancient families in Dampston!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The three ancient families, under the lobbying of Alexander, reached a cooperation agreement. They wanted to eliminate all other ancient families in Dampston, leaving only the Paltrow family, the Walker family, and the Luther family in Dampston!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By then, the three ancient families will divide up all the benefits of Dampston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only in this way can our three ancient families become stronger and compete with those mighty ancient families in Newport City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Augustine family is the first target we chose. Firstly, the Augustine family was relatively weak. Secondly, the Paltrow family has set their sights on the Augustine family's cruise ship business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Ghost Ship has become a knife in the hands of the three major families by the </span><span>third generation. As long as the three major families order us, we will act."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Webster finished, Osborne became extremely solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had long guessed that a powerful force must be behind the Ghost Ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had thought there was only the Paltrow family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "There are also the Walker family and the Luther family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Paltrow family, the Walker family, and the Luther family are the three most powerful ancient families in Dampston. On the surface, they are competitors and often have conflicts and fights. But secretly, they have allied long ago!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And all this was led by Alexander!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three ancient families joined forces to wipe out the other six ancient families in Dampston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family was just their first target!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had to admit that he was shocked. Alexander was really smart. He had actually joined forces with two other ancient families and wanted to monopolize all the interests of Dampston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he succeeded, the Paltrow family would definitely become a superpower that ranked among the top in the Rosmandi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Alexander's plan had just begun when Osborne discovered it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes were filled with coldness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "If I spread this news, the six ancient families will probably panic and even unite to deal with the alliance between the Paltrow family, the Walker family, and the Luther family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, Alexander will be distraught. He wants to attack and destroy the Augustine family first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Let's see who will be destroyed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, I have to think carefully about when to spread this news."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking about it, Osborne asked again, "Who killed Allen, the head of the Augustine family?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
