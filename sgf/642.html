  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa No. 61 roared, "Are you trying to die? Is this all just to buy time? It won't help. As long as we stick together, you can't do anything to us. And let me say it again. We're not clones. We're perfect evolved beings born for war."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, all three Medusas became extremely vigilant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne made a stretching gesture towards them. Although this made them wary, they were surprised to find themselves untouched. But then, something bizarre and terrifying happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne's motion stopped, the space around Medusa No. 61 twisted and stretched rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three Marquis Medusas, who had been close together, were suddenly pulled apart by a vast distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up. His killing intent surged. "Now's the chance. Go to hell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had successfully stretched the space between the three Marquis Medusas, increasing their distance. Without hesitation, he launched a ferocious attack on the nearest, Marquis Medusa No. 61.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marquis Medusa No. 61 was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected her two companions to be separated by hundreds of feet in an instant. She lost focus for a moment, and by the time she realized the danger, it was too late to dodge Osborne's attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes blazed with intense light as she pushed her petrification power to its limit, even causing blood to flow from her eyes. Her body quickly transformed into a beast-like form for defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought of herself as a perfect evolved being born for war, with not only powerful petrification power but also formidable physical strength and defense. However, Osborne's attack was overwhelming. His martial art aura completely countered the petrification effect, and his fist slammed heavily into Marquis Medusa No. 61's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's fist created a large hole in Marquis Medusa No. 61's chest. Blood gushed out. Despite her resilience, she wasn't dead yet. Her vitality was incredibly strong. If her companions had been nearby, they could have bought her time to recover much of her strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Osborne had already used space stretching to separate her companions by hundreds of feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they were rushing back, they were too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die." Osborne struck Marquis Medusa No. 61's head with another powerful punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her head exploded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with her immense vitality and inhuman nature, she couldn't survive having her head shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marquis Medusa No. 61's body crashed heavily to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, No. 62 and No. 63 finally arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was madness in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne showed no fear. He waved his hand again, instantly stretching the space between the two, putting their distance apart by hundreds of feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He focused on the closer No. 62 and resumed his brutal assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marquis Medusa No. 62, although also a Class AA like Osborne, was far weaker in comparison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without her companions' help, she couldn't hold out long against Osborne. In just two punches, he heavily injured her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marquis Medusa No. 63 tried to intervene to help No. 62, hoping to buy her some time, but Osborne wouldn't allow it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As No. 63 was about to reach Osborne, he waved his hand again, stretching the space and sending No. 63's attack wide. She was pushed back to hundreds of feet away again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" No. 63 roared in despair and helplessly watched Osborne, hundreds of feet away, smash Marquis Medusa No. 62's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, No. 63 turned and fled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After killing No. 62, Osborne felt a bit pale. Stretching space was seemingly easy but was highly draining, severely depleting his mental energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing No. 63 escape, Osborne snorted coldly, "If space can be stretched, it can also be folded. Trying to run? Come back here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he waved his hand again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the distance between Osborne and No. 63 shrank from hundreds of feet to just dozens of feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No. 63, still with her back turned to Osborne, was caught off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seeking death," Osborne sneered, seizing the opportunity to attack fiercely, delivering several punches that severely wounded No. 63.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No. 63 coughed up blood mixed with fragments of her internal organs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She struggled to lift her head and glared at Osborne with hatred. "Osborne, the great King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> will avenge me. The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> will never forgive you. I'll be waiting for you in hell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at No. 63 and said with a faint smile, "You still claim you're not clones? Even your final words are just like those of Count Medusa No. 7."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No. 63 was momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, uninterested in her further, said coldly, "Clone, I'll send you back for reworking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he prepared to crush No. 63's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, something unexpected happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Satan's Eye began to throb wildly. An intense sense of danger surged within him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
