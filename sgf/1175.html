  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hadn't anticipated that, in a moment of desperation, a casual attempt to invoke the energy of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity using the Breath of Celestial would bear such unexpected fruit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his utter astonishment, the Primordial Crimson Lotus actually "spat" out a surge of energy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the Primordial Crimson Lotus, this energy was trivial. But for Osborne, it was monumental&mdash;a power so vast that comparing it to the energy he usually harnessed from the outside world was like contrasting a precious gem with dirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This energy was not only immense but also pure, refined to perfection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this newfound energy, the speed at which he could refine his Divine Bone skyrocketed, increasing a hundredfold. Osborne felt the essence deep within him begin to change; his bones transformed, becoming crystal clear, exuding a frightening aura that spoke of untold power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? No way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain, who was perched atop a petal of the Lotus, couldn't believe his eyes. He was witnessing the energy being expelled from the core of the flower itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't grasp the full magnitude of what was happening, but Cain did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That energy was the core essence of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It might seem inconsequential, yet it was vital for the Lotus' survival. Legend had it that this essence was absorbed long before the cosmic explosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an energy that ensured the Lotus' immortality even in the face of universal </span><span>annihilation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, it was bestowing a fragment of that core energy onto Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain was left in stunned disbelief, jealousy darkening his expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recalled how the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity had once merged with his Divine Body. Even after his ascension to Deity Overlord, their bond had deepened to an astounding fifth threshold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet despite that close connection, he had never been able to tap into the Lotus' power, let alone its core energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Why is this happening? Why would the Primordial Crimson Lotus give you its core energy? This is completely out of the question! What's so special about you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain seethed with envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, catching the hint in Cain's words, felt a flicker of realization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pondered, "The core energy of the Primordial Crimson Lotus?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's actually a gift?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So it's not just me pulling it in with the Breath of Celestial?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe I should give it another shot?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the first burst of core energy had dramatically enhanced his refining speed, Osborne was hungry for more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I could access just a bit more core energy, I could skyrocket this process! Who knows? Maybe I could forge a Level Seven Solar Divine Body!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With resolve brewing within him, Osborne took a deep breath and invoked the Breath of Celestial again, reaching into the very heart of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity for its power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon enough, another surge of core energy manifested, and Osborne's eyes widened in delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's still more! It seems those core energies of the Primordial Crimson Lotus aren't as exhausted as Cain claimed. They're responding to my invocation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Encouraged, he feverishly channeled the Breath of Celestial once more, drawing upon the Lotus' core energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abruptly, he managed to summon nine more tendrils of that intense energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet just at that moment, Osborne paused, his heart sinking at what he saw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity began to lose its luster. Once a vibrant crimson, it now appeared dimmer, almost transparent. Its vibrant hues dulled, and the frequency of its vibrations quickened, suggesting an underlying agitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Cain was frantic, his eyes bloodshot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, stop! Stop right now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nine core forces! How is this possible? It actually gave you nine core forces? Does it not want to live anymore? This is insane!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These are its core forces&mdash;there are only so many, and once lost, they can never be replenished!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Losing nine core energies at once is the limit!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Any more, and it'll collapse!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, what's going on here? Stop it immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain was bellowing frantically, not at Osborne, but at the Primordial Crimson Lotus </span><span>of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even then, he still believed that the lotus had willingly gifted its core energies to Osborne rather than Osborne having harnessed them himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Lost and unreplenishable? Another drop and the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity would collapse?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nine core energies are already more than enough! Now, it's time to build my Divine Bones and Flesh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne ceased absorbing the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity's core energies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the lotus was a Cosmic Treasure, crucial for immortality. He didn't want it to collapse and risk losing the bigger picture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Refine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With control over the nine core energies of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, Osborne began forging his Divine Bones and Flesh. The process was astonishingly rapid and thorough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was highly unlikely that anyone else could refine their Divine Body using such high-level core energies from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><div class="pagination">
