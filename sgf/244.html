Otherwise, once the news of the blood diamonds spreads, I'm afraid another War of Madness will erupt!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the last War of Madness, the Sinclair family, the owner of the diamond mine, was incredibly powerful, comparable to the ancient families in Newport City. There were several Class A masters alone. Even ten Chevalier families combined were not as powerful as the Sinclair family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, the Sinclair family was wiped out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With my current strength, it's impossible for me to hold onto the diamond mine. Once the news of the blood diamond leaks out, all major forces will flock to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first one to die will be me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, perhaps even my grandfather, Godfather, may not be able to protect me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The existence of blood diamonds must be absolutely kept confidential!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne made a decision in his heart. He hesitated for a moment, but still resisted the urge to continue absorbing the power of the blood diamond. Otherwise, if he came to the diamond mine once, his power would increase significantly, which might be </span><span>suspected by people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne must have to absorb the blood diamonds slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened the Dimensional Space and carefully put away the blood diamond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will keep looking for blood diamonds!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since I have found a blood diamond, I may find more! The higher the level of the power, the more difficult it is to improve. I can only improve quickly by obtaining enough blood diamonds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, there are four people with great strength in the Augustine family in Newport City. Sooner or later, they will regard me as their rival and compete with me for the position of Godfather's successor. Each of them is much stronger than me, and they are already Class A masters in their twenties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I don't improve my strength quickly, I will die miserably if I run into them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured and continued to look for the blood diamond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he discovered the second blood diamond, swiftly extracted it, and placed it in the Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dimensional Space was a parallel space that could isolate all energy fluctuations. If the blood diamond was placed in the Dimensional Space, there would definitely not be any energy fluctuations transmitted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne found the third, the fourth...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just two hours, he found six blood diamonds deep in the mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made him extremely surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at the same time, Osborne was perplexed. He believed that while the blood diamonds were well-hidden, they were not hard to find with careful searching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, Godfather once controlled this diamond mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather also had Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Satan's Eye also had the ability of X-ray vision, so why didn't Godfather find blood diamonds here? Many of the Augustine family's descendants probably came here to look for blood diamonds, but why didn't they find any?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that they actually discovered it, but just hid the news?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they really discovered blood diamonds, they would never sell this diamond mine at a low price of 15 billion dollars. Even if it was 150 billion dollars or one trillion dollars, it would be impossible to be sold! So, neither Godfather nor the descendants of the Augustine family find blood diamonds here, only I did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why is that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that my Satan's Eye has mutated and the X-ray vision has become stronger?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, his guess was correct.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Satan's Eye inherited by the Augustine family also had the ability of X-ray vision, the effect of X-ray vision was far less powerful than that of Osborne, which could penetrate rocks dozens of feet deep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, they were completely incomparable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the most powerful Godfather, whose Satan's Eye was already at level six, could </span><span>only see through rocks less than 3.9 inches thick. He might not even be able to see through the skin of an ordinary uncut diamonds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under such circumstances, how could Godfather discover blood diamonds with the help of Satan's Eye?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Osborne's Satan's Eye became incredibly terrifying in terms of X-ray vision after mutation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a pity that he knew nothing about this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't think much about it and soon stopped caring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what, the blood diamond was his chance, and Osborne wished he could stay here forever and use the X-ray vision of Satan's Eye to find all the blood diamonds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, he couldn't do that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to leave first! Otherwise, it might arouse suspicion. I can look for it later as I have the chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finishing muttering, Osborne walked out of the mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his hand, he still carried three high-quality uncut diamonds, which looked inconspicuous, but after cutting and polishing, they would become brilliant diamonds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, Osborne found Valentin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked Valentin to form a mining protection team to guard the diamond mine, and then returned alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, a shocking news spread throughout </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>.</span></p><div class="pagination">
