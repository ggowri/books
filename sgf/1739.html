  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could barely hide his surprise. The strength Anastasia demonstrated exceeded even his expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Her command over lightning is downright extraordinary! And it feels like her lightning is miles beyond the usual sort," he thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always known Anastasia could defeat Alfred</span><span>, e</span><span>ven with the Supreme Malevolence Sword and Shield aiding him</span><span>, </span><span>but seeing her dispatch him so effortlessly was a revelation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I wanted to take her down, I'd likely have to pull out all the stops! And who knows if she has any hidden cards up her sleeve?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought pleased him immensely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stronger Anastasia was, the happier he felt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearby, Hannah and Raoul stood in stunned silence, their eyes wide as they processed what had just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raoul, particularly shaken, was all too familiar with Alfred's power. Having faced him personally, Raoul understood just how formidable Alfred was, even with the Supreme Malevolence Sword and Shield boosting his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Raoul, defeating Alfred would require at least reaching the mid-stage of Deity King status to feel confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, Anastasia had decimated him with apparent ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raoul gasped, his mind racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "What kind of prodigy is she?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn!" Just then, a thunderous roar shattered the stunned silence. Aldrich appeared beside Alfred in the blink of an eye, his face a storm of anger and murderous intent as he assessed Alfred's injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swiftly produced a pill and urged Alfred to take it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the pallor of Alfred's face slowly ebbed away, turning a healthier shade of red, his wounds began to mend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, while his physical injuries were healing, the psychological blow he had suffered was something much harder to fix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze was distant, almost vacant. It was as if he was trapped in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred had lost!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had considered the possibility of losing, especially given the vastness of Celestara, where exceptional talents abounded. There were so many stronger than him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alfred had never imagined the defeat would be this humbling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could a member of the so-called lowly Human Community, fighting him on even footing, unarmed, utterly humiliate him</span><span>, </span><span>a wielder of the Supreme Malevolence Sword and Shield?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a complete and utter rout!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hope felt like a fleeting dream, slipping further and further away with every passing second. He knew that even if given a hundred more chances, Anastasia would easily defeat him again without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The despair and overwhelming gap in power inflicted a heavy wound on Alfred's prideful heart, one he struggled to bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why? Why did this happen? How could I lose? How could I suffer such a humiliating defeat? No!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This can't be happening! I belong to the noble Paramount Supreme Clan! I have </span><span>infinite resources at my disposal. I am a genius! How could I ever lose to the despised Human Community?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could I be defeated so soundly? No! It's impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich, witnessing Alfred's panicked murmurs, felt a surge of dread wash over him. It was clear that Alfred's spirit was fracturing; self-doubt had begun to creep in</span><span> and</span><span> shatter</span><span>ed</span><span> Alfred's confidence. If he didn't act quickly, this could ruin Alfred for life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Aldrich felt powerless at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His anger boiled over as he locked his icy gaze on Anastasia. "You vile girl from the Human Community! How dare you harm a successor of the Bowman family? If I don't make you pay for this, what will become of our family's honor?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I had hoped to keep things fair, but now I'm left with no choice! I'll capture you, and you'll serve as a slave to the Bowman family, whether you like it or not!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich finished speaking and handed Alfred off to his subordinates for care. Then, he began to stride toward Anastasia, his presence growing more imposing with every step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he loomed over her like an unstoppable mountain, a chilling aura of murderous intent wrapping around her like a shroud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia frowned</span><span>. A</span><span>n uncomfortable pressure settl</span><span>ed </span><span>over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich was already a mid-stage Deity King, and the difference in their realms loomed large.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even before he made a move, the weight of his strength was palpable, unlike the situation with Alfred, which had felt different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anastasia didn't flinch. Her body stiffened, muscles coiling like a spring as she braced herself for battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich saw her steely resolve and let out a mocking laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, well, the famed Seven Young Deity Kings of the Human Community! How bold of you, Vivienne! Standing against me without a shred of fear, thinking you can fight me? Do you have a death wish?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He began to gather his power, ready to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Osborne appeared at Anastasia's side, pulling her protectively behind him to confront Aldrich directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll take this one!" he declared, his voice steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia hesitated for a moment, her instincts battling with her trust in him, but ultimately, she nodded, acknowledging his choice. "Alright!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne fixed his gaze on Aldrich, his demeanor calm. "I remember Alfred saying that if someone could defeat him in one-on-one combat, the Bowman family would spare the Mystic Feather Clan. With Alfred's defeat, doesn't that mean you should release the Mystic Feather Clan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich frowned, the confidence momentarily slipping from his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you are..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, a confident glint in his eyes, "I'm Theodore Augustine, the leader of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich's eyes widened in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? So you're the head honcho of the Seven Young Deity Kings?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
