  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To master advanced martial arts techniques, one needed more than just guidance. The most crucial factor was talent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Talent was always the key factor that created a difference between individuals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was grateful that his talent in martial arts seemed to be quite exceptional. After Isa broke down the technique of Ninefold Tide Crash and taught it to him, he quickly grasped it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At present, he could only unleash two strikes at a time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This indicated that Osborne had reached the basic level of mastering the Ninefold Tide Crash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His combat capability had thus increased by 30%.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa told him that other martial artists, even a Class A martial master, would find it impossible to learn the Ninefold Tide Crash through self-study alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with guidance, it would take the average person at least a month to reach the basic level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne took only a few hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This proved that Osborne's talent in martial arts was undoubtedly top-tier. However, it was also due to Isa's excellent teaching. After all, her skills were extraordinarily powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like a math PhD tutoring an elementary school student in math. It was effortless for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only thing that puzzled Osborne was that Isa claimed she wasn't a Class S Supreme Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "If she isn't a Class S Supreme Overlord, could she be just in Class AAA? If that's the case, how could she make Bryce admire her so much and follow her every word?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forget it. I won't dwell on it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's actually better if she isn't a Class S Supreme Overlord. At least that way, I have a better chance of catching up to her, maybe even surpassing her. If Isa really were a Class S Supreme Overlord, I'd have to rely on a miracle to ever catch up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, Ms. Hernandez said that Bryce is the one closest to the Class S Supreme Overlord among the younger generation and is the most hopeful of becoming a Class S Supreme Overlord. Isa is also part of the younger generation, so her true strength should be less than Bryce's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe there's another reason Bryce admires her so much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued his cultivation while silently contemplating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you thinking about? How can you not be focused while cultivating? Do you think just having a bit of talent makes you special? You're wasting your talent by not concentrating. When do you think you'll catch up to me? When do you think you'll make me submit to you? In this way, how can you let me obediently lie on the bed and let you do as you please?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Isa's cold voice broke the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had noticed Osborne's lack of focus and couldn't help but scold him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, her words stirred something deep inside Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth and began practicing the Ninefold Tide Crash over and over again, declaring, "Isa, I won't keep you waiting long! I'll catch up to you soon, and surpass you! You're just in Class AAA. I'll catch up to you within a year! When that time comes, I'll definitely make you submit to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was filled with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa couldn't help but smile mischievously as she heard his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She deliberately responded coldly, "Are you just boasting? It's funny for you to think you can reach Class AAA in a year? Do you really think you can catch up to me? I'm afraid you'll never be able to match my level!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, she gave Osborne a provocative look, then reclined on the sofa, showcasing her seductive figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth again and trained even harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "One year... I'll reach Class AAA within one year!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have to do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne threw himself into his training, becoming more and more proficient with the Ninefold Tide Crash. By the next day, he suddenly succeeded in unleashing a third wave of attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This development even surprised Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "His talent in martial arts is incredible! He's already managed to unleash the third wave so quickly. At this rate, it won't be long before he masters the Ninefold Tide Crash. By then, his attack power could increase by 60%."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa stroked her chin, deep in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I can't let him get too cocky. I need to give him more motivation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, Isa stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take a break."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stopped. After unleashing three waves for the first time, he quickly got the hang of it, and before long, he could consistently unleash three waves of attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt that he could soon unleash the fourth, fifth, and even sixth wave, and mastered the Ninefold Tide Crash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This thought made Osborne very excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After stopping his practice, he walked over to Isa, wrapped his arms around her slender waist, and pressed his lips to hers, kissing her deeply and hungrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until a minute later that Isa pushed him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wiping her lips, Isa complained, "You're all sweaty and you stink! &nbsp;Can't you kiss less? My lips are swollen from your kisses."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she finished speaking, Isa's face turned bright red. Though her expression remained cold, her eyes were filled with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly, "No way! Not even one kiss can be less, because kissing you gives me more motivation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop making excuses!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa glared at him and said, "You've learned enough of the Ninefold Tide Crash. From here on, you just need to keep practicing. Today, I'll teach you another advanced martial arts technique."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's anticipation soared at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What technique?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled slightly, "Point Blank Force! This technique compresses power into an extremely small point, creating astonishing penetrating force, far surpassing Spiral Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, the difficulty of learning Point Blank Force far exceeds that of Spiral Force. So, even if I made the method public, most Class A martial masters wouldn't be able to learn it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I will teach you!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
