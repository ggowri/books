  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, thanks for having my back </span><span>back</span><span> there," Osborne said sincerely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he could have easily handled Emmett on his own, Diana's willingness to step in and confront Emmett head-on moved him deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was one of the rare moments since arriving in </span><span>Celestara</span><span> that he felt genuinely touched by a fellow member of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This experience solidified his resolve to find a way to help Diana escape this place and change her circumstances for the better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's cheeks flushed at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need to mention it! Didn't you say we're friends? Friends help each other out! I'm sure if I were in trouble, you'd jump in without a second thought."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and nodded earnestly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I won't hold back then! It's a pity there was only one </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> earlier. If there had been more, maybe we could have taken them all down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Did Osborne really just suggest taking out Riley and Emmett?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That is some serious guts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't voice her concerns; she understood that if Osborne didn't strike back, he'd eventually be a target himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that thought, she immediately felt a surge of anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I'll help you!" she declared, determination in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded, impressed by her unexpected strength. In his eyes, her talent rivaled that of Hannah. Even though she was only a late-stage Celestial Deity, she was definitely stronger than most peak Celestial Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could hold her own against a Deity Overlord warrior for a while, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What mattered most was her wealth of experience. With Diana's help, taking down Emmett and Riley would be a lot easier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they continued scouting ahead, they encountered no further ambushes from the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Near Divine Peak Nine, while </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> were more numerous, they didn't just lurk around every corner; otherwise, no one would dare to mine for Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, they emerged from the winding tunnels into a vast underground chamber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is it&mdash;the 53rd Mining Area, part of our Wild Flame City's extraction zone! But it's pretty dangerous down here, which is why you won't find many folks around, except for me!" Diana announced with a hint of pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The underground space was eerily quiet. Osborne activated Satan's Eye, scanning the area to ensure it was safe before he felt at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his attention was soon captured by something glimmering in the walls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There, embedded in the hard rock, were clusters of crystals that sparkled like diamonds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could these be... Ultimate Essence Crystals?" Osborne gasped, unable to contain his excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, within his Dimensional Space, Osborne had countless mid-grade and top-grade Essence Crystals&mdash;enough to last a lifetime and then some. Yet he didn't possess a single Ultimate Essence Crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those precious crystals only existed near Divine Peak, and they were a rare treasure indeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One Ultimate Essence Crystal contained a wealth of natural energy equivalent to a hundred top-grade Essence Crystals, and it was purer besides. Training with an Ultimate Essence Crystal could dramatically accelerate his cultivation speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the most outstanding talents of the Upper Races couldn't all take advantage of Ultimate Essence Crystals; it was only the prodigies from the Paramount Supreme Clan who could afford to use them in large quantities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes were glued to the Ultimate Essence Crystals, a yearning in his heart to strip away every last one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he wanted to, he could easily harness his spatial power to do just that without anyone noticing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, he refrained from taking action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a place where Diana frequently mined for Essence Crystals. If Osborne were to strip this location of all its Ultimate Essence Crystals, Diana would no longer be able to do her job.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without those crystals, she couldn't complete her tasks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "I'll deal with it later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't rely on Essence Crystals to boost my strength anyway. Even if I had Ultimate Essence Crystals, the speed of cultivation would still pale in comparison to what I can achieve with my Infinite Devouring Eyes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne tucked away his Satan's Eye just as Emmett, Riley, and the others arrived in the mining zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spread out and check the area! Make sure it's safe!" Riley commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, several members of the escort group began meticulously inspecting the surroundings, ensuring there were no </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> lurking in the shadows. Once they confirmed the area was clear, they gathered around Riley, forming a protective barrier around Emmett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Emmett and Riley's gazes fell on Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana! Let's get started! We're all waiting on those Ultimate Essence Crystals!" Emmett said coolly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana frowned but ultimately nodded. "All right, but I can't guarantee how long it will take to mine an Ultimate Essence Crystal. It's really all down to luck!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she pulled out her Spirit Tracer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The device led her to a specific section of the wall, where she began using her earth elemental power to carefully break down the rock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her earth elemental essence had reached early Level Six, yet the process was still painfully slow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a distance, Riley, Emmett, and the others watched, seemingly uninterested in lending a hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne kept a close eye on the scene as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like an eternity, roughly half an hour later, Diana finally extracted her first Ultimate Essence Crystal.</span></p><div class="pagination">
