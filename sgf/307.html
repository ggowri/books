  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Queenie decisively admitted her defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She still had a few tricks up her sleeve. After all, she was not only a Class B metahuman but also a Class B martial artist. Her close combat skills were equally formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she admitted her defeat without hesitation because she knew that even in close combat, she would undoubtedly not be a match for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had effortlessly resisted Ryan's gravity field, but she couldn't do that alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she were enveloped by Ryan's gravity field, it would be difficult for her to even move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, Queenie knew that the gap between them and Osborne was vast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Osborne in disbelief. She truly couldn't comprehend how Osborne had controlled her arrows and then retaliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was an utter miracle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a stronger mind control metahuman than her could not have achieved it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I surrender."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that very moment, Kaden hauled himself back to his feet and found his body was a canvas of pain. He had just faced the might of Osborne, feeling the colossal power within Osborne, as overwhelming as a Tyrannosaurus Rex in its prime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that Osborne had held back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, Kaden's bones would have been shattered beyond count.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I give up, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan flushed with the heat of defeat. Osborne had mastered his flames, nearly consuming Nathan in the very fire he wielded. Unwilling as he was to accept it, Nathan had no choice but to yield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, only Ryan stood undefeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, as Osborne gazed at Ryan, a fleeting shadow of unwillingness in Ryan's eyes was swiftly replaced by acceptance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan smiled and spread his hands in a sign of surrender. "I admit defeat, too! My sole weapon is the gravity field, but it couldn't even bind you. I stand no chance against you.</span><span> </span><span>You are too powerful; I surrender!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder </span><span>the </span><span>Wise Order chose you unanimously as the heir of the Augustine family. You are more than qualified!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ryan's words faded, silence enveloped the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The direct descendants of the Augustine family, spectators to this battle, stared at Osborne in awe, particularly those who had doubted him. Now, they were wishing for the earth to swallow them whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had won.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a victory as clean as it was decisive, a crushing triumph that left no room for doubt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four most promising youths of the Augustine family, united, had been no match for Osborne, falling with ease before his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could they not be shocked by such a display?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Brian gazed at Osborne in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He questioned himself, knowing that even he, against the combined forces of Ryan, Nathan, Kaden and Queenie, could not have won so effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne had done it with seeming ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian inhaled </span><span>deeply,</span><span> his eyes alight with wonder. The stronger Osborne was, the brighter the hope for the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's laughter boomed. "Magnificent! Truly magnificent! Our Augustine family has finally birthed a genius of the highest caliber! A genius who rivals the heirs of any other ancient family!</span><span> </span><span>Osborne, you are exceptional!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, does anyone still question his right to be our successor? Any among the younger generation who refuses to accept this, step forward and challenge Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's declaration was met with silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four strongest of the younger generation had fallen, so who else dared to challenge Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a path to certain doom if someone dared to challenge Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at Osborne with a mix of doubt and surprise, but no voice rose in opposition to his claim as heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had proven his worth through strength, qualifying him beyond doubt for the role he was to inherit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Osborne allowed himself a faint smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He surveyed the gathering and stated calmly, "Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to introduce myself. I am Osborne Augustine. When I first arrived at the Augustine Estate, the elders from </span><span>the </span><span>Wise Order entrusted me with the role of heir. I must admit I was terrified, but I am willing to shoulder this great responsibility.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We all know the dire straits the Augustine family is in. Moving forward, I hope to assist and change our family's fate.</span><span> </span><span>Should I err, I ask for your forgiveness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne finished, a fervent discussion erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This young man seems quite promising."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Indeed. The son of Allen has grown to be so exceptional despite living away for over two decades."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have no objection to him as our heir."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps his arrival will truly change our situation for the better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I find myself eagerly anticipating what's to come."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one opposed Osborne's ascension now. Brian raised his hand, and silence fell once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since there are no objections, let it be known that this matter is settled! We shall inform the other ancient families at once that the Augustine family has found its heir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian's enthusiasm was palpable, mirroring the growing excitement among the gathered members of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The murmurs of approval and whispers of hope lasted. As the crowd began to disperse, Brian took Osborne aside. It was time for Osborne to be introduced to the core senior executives of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne breathed a sigh of relief afterward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was still somewhat unaccustomed to such formal occasions. Despite his discomfort, he navigated the challenges with grace. His display of strength earned him the respect and courtesy of those around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Four young figures suddenly approached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan, Kaden, Ryan, and Queenie surrounded Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan stepped forward and flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knelt before Osborne and declared with sincerity, "Osborne, I am here to honor my promise! I have lost</span><span> the battle</span><span>, and from this moment forward, you are my brother!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you bid me go east, I shall never go west!</span><span> </span><span>If you command me to leap from a building, I would never dive into the sea!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
