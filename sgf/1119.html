  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was utterly bewildered. The words spilling from Ophelia's lips made no sense at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt as though he was facing not Ophelia but a stranger altogether.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From her demeanor to her tone, everything had shifted, leaving him with the impression that she had morphed into someone entirely different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart sank. "Is this what breaking through to Class S does?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And what on earth is she rambling about?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Has something truly gone wrong with Ophelia's breakthrough? She's not dead, but her mind is?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mental issues!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She's hallucinating, seeing things!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She's talking about defeating me and trampling me underfoot! This is clearly a delusion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Ophelia were a top-tier Class S, Osborne held absolute confidence that he </span><span>could still overpower her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia said with a chilling smile, "Since you're quiet, I'll take that as a sign you're ready.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I'm about to make my move!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll fulfill her obsession by stamping you down until you regret ever crossing me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Ophelia vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost simultaneously, a second Ophelia emerged behind Osborne, striking him with a force that sent him flying across the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne barely had time to react before the devastating blow sent him barreling through the air, snapping several bones and forcing a bitter taste of blood from his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stunned, he stared at her in disbelief&mdash;completely at a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When did she slip behind me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There had been no ripples of energy, nothing to indicate her sudden movement. The sheer power that struck him was beyond what a newly-minted Class S should possess!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Gerardo's most potent strike couldn't compare!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression soured as his realization hit him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could gather his thoughts, she disappeared once more, and his body was struck again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of crunching bones echoed in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia taunted, "Feeling good?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How's that for a wake-up call? You're just too weak! If it weren't for her obsession, I wouldn't even bother with you. But now? I have to fulfill her wishes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, she vanished, and he was launched skyward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was dumbfounded. "What the hell is happening?" He felt as though he had power in spades, but against Ophelia, all that strength was rendered useless!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia, who had become strangely potent and relentless, radiated a power that instilled a heavy sense of despair in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a feeling of utter helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't wrap his head around it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time and again, Osborne found himself hurled away by Ophelia's attacks, and yet, he sensed she wasn't even unleashing her full power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was almost as if she was holding back, careful not to kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne attempted to strike back, but his efforts were futile; his fists seemed to pass through nothingness. Ophelia moved like a wraith, disappearing and reappearing quicker than he could track, and she could easily be on the opposite side of the place in the next heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The harder he tried to retaliate, the more elusive she became. And her relentless assaults? He couldn't evade those at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of technique is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperation drove Osborne mad as he coughed up more blood; he had never encountered a fight like this before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia was tormenting him&mdash;shaming him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he struggled on the ground, she stood over him, looking down with an air of superiority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Osborne, how does my power feel? Oh, and by the way, she insisted that I stomp you underfoot! So, I'll grant her that wish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Ophelia's foot came down squarely on Osborne's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne barely had a moment to react before the impact hit, and he coughed up another mouthful of blood, his spirit waning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell are you? You're not Ophelia!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared up at her, recognizing the face he once cherished, yet deep down, he knew&mdash;this wasn't Ophelia, not by a long shot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's lips twisted into a cold smile. "Oh, but I am Ophelia!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your former wife&mdash;Ophelia! Just a version you've never seen before. Now tell me, in the face of this overwhelming power, are you feeling a twinge of regret?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll ask you one last time... do you want to remarry me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you agree, I'll let you go. If not? Well... you can meet your end."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body froze. The coldness of her words cut deeper than any blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glaring at her, he gritted his teeth and retorted, "Remarry?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think I'd ever agree to that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not Ophelia! Get out of her body, now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, a mocking smile crept across Ophelia's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you think I've just taken over her body, huh? Well, you're not entirely wrong. I've trapped her soul and claimed her body as my own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But why on earth would I release her at your request? Didn't you claim to be indifferent to her? Didn't you say you hated her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I make her vanish, shouldn't that put a smile on your face?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
