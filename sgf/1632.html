  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was completely taken aback by the sheer power of Spatial Clone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The most astonishing part was that each clone would possess the same peak combat strength as he did. Just imagine&mdash;if he reached Level Nine and created two hundred fifty-six clones, all fighting alongside him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The thought sent shivers down his spine. These clones would be perfectly in sync with his intentions, their coordination surpassing that of any trained army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the members of the Blood Demon would pale in comparison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How terrifying would that be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just the idea made his skin crawl, and he found himself itching to dive into training for Spatial Clone, eager to elevate its level as quickly as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne managed to rein in his excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, his breakthrough to Level Seven in space elemental essence had granted him three new spatial techniques, and Spatial Clone was just one of them. He also had Spatial Cleaving and Spatial Sealing to consider.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Spatial Cleaving allowed him to forcibly split a section of space into two completely isolated areas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was essentially an upgraded version of Spatial Prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The legendary God of Space had used this very technique to sever the Blue Planet from Celestara, creating two entirely separate worlds that could no longer interact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, Osborne knew he wasn't nearly capable of such a feat just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At most, he could isolate a space with a radius of about six miles from Celestara, making it disappear from the realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He pondered how to leverage Spatial Cleaving to enhance his combat capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What if I used Spatial Cleaving like a large-scale Spatial Prison? I could forcefully separate the space where my enemies are located.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And if I combine it with Spatial Sealing...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That could be incredibly effective!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Spatial Sealing, the third technique gifted to him after breaking through to Level Seven, was straightforward yet powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It allowed him to make a section of real space vanish from the universe, sealing it away in Dimensional Space or even deeper realms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The God of Space had chosen to seal the death-tainted Celestara in Dimensional Space, hoping to trap Lord Malevolence along with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, he ultimately failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Celestara had somehow broken free from its seal and returned to the real universe shortly after.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this wasn't due to the inadequacy of Spatial Sealing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Combining Spatial Cleaving with Spatial Sealing could yield remarkable results! First, I'll use Spatial Cleaving to isolate my enemies, then follow up with Spatial Sealing to trap them completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unless someone is significantly stronger than me, they won't be able to escape from the sealed space!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The thought brought a smile to Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt incredibly satisfied with the three new spatial techniques, especially Spatial Clone, which significantly boosted both his combat power and survivability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne realized he had only just grasped the basics of Spatial Clone and hadn't fully mastered it yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"First things first, I need to get Spatial Clone to Level One! Once I hit that milestone, I can start creating clones!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With renewed determination, Osborne dove headfirst into his training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whether it was because Spatial Clone was inherently easy to learn or due to the massive boost in comprehension he was experiencing, he found the training surprisingly straightforward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In just an hour, he successfully mastered Spatial Clone, reaching Level One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now that he could create one clone, Osborne was practically buzzing with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's give this a shot!" he murmured, channeling his spatial energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a surge of power, a perfectly identical clone materialized beside him. Osborne stared at the replica, his jaw dropping in astonishment. He couldn't help but feel a mix of disbelief and exhilaration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He murmured, "Unbelievable! It looks just like me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can't even tell the difference! Every feature, every nuance of power and aura is exactly the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's like looking into a mirror!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he concentrated, controlling the Spatial Clone felt as effortless as moving his own arm, as if the clone were an extension of his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a grin, Osborne then experimented with switching places between himself and the clone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With just a thought, they exchanged positions seamlessly, leaving no trace of anything unusual. The ability to let his clone slip into an alternate dimension provided an invaluable strategic advantage. If his original self faced an overwhelming attack, Osborne could swiftly switch places with the clone, allowing his real body to escape or hide instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's satisfaction washed over him like a warm tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With this Spatial Clone, it's like my strength has doubled! Plus, I can coordinate with my clone so perfectly that one plus one equals more than two! This is incredible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The boost he gained from reaching Level Seven in his space elemental essence had already significantly elevated his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Coupled with his three new formidable spatial techniques, Osborne felt invincible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was brimming with confidence and couldn't shake the thought&mdash;maybe it was time to test his limits against a Deity Overlord in the late stages or even one at their peak.</span></p><div class="pagination">
