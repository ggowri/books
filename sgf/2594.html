  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Zorro announced the participants for the first match, the crowd erupted into enthusiastic discussions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By now, as the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel progressed, most spectators had a fairly clear understanding of the contestants' strengths. Almost everyone knew that the two strongest among the top five were definitely Seraphina and Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina, ranked first on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, has been the most favored from the start. The competition has proven this as well&mdash;she's definitely not exaggerating her strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From defeating Mason with just one move, she has been showcasing her terrifying strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No opponent could withstand a single move from her, even another prince was effortlessly defeated by her in one strike.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The key is, everyone knows Seraphina hasn&rsquo;t even gotten serious, as she hasn&rsquo;t used her true weapon from start to finish.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When defeating the other prince, she only used a Superior Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, everyone knows Seraphina's true weapon is a very powerful Supreme Sacred Artifact. She has already mastered and can wield the Supreme Sacred Artifact effectively.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, once Seraphina gets completely serious and unleashes her full power, how terrifying would she be?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, most people believe Seraphina will undoubtedly claim the championship, and the only person who might pose a threat to her is Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's performance is equally outstanding. Although he only had two real matches, defeating Yunus, ranked fifth in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, and Matthew, ranked third, is enough to prove his strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, the way he fought was terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Against Yunus, Osborne fired only one arrow. Moreover, he didn&rsquo;t even look at the result before turning and walking away, and he really defeated Yunus with just one arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Facing Matthew, Osborne abandoned his best archery skills and instead used Matthew's specialty, close combat, completely overpowering and defeating him in hand-to-hand combat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These two duels have already proven Osborne's strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone knows the final champion will definitely be either Seraphina or Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, the first match of the top five ranking competition will be Seraphina versus Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man exclaimed in shock, "This is the championship battle!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A woman said, "Whoever wins this duel will be the final champion."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another man agreed, "I really look forward to it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many in the crowd were full of anticipation and excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, more people felt disdain. A man said coldly, "Championship battle? Whoever wins is the champion? Does anyone seriously think Osborne has a chance to win?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A woman proudly said, "Osborne is indeed strong, but in front of Princess Seraphina, he has no chance of winning the championship."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's wait and see. When Princess Seraphina unleashes her full power, Osborne will be easily defeated by her. By then, Princess Seraphina's strength will astonish everyone."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man agreed, "That's right. There's no championship battle in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel because the moment Princess Seraphina decided to participate, the champion was already determined. Princess Seraphina will definitely win."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most of the people present supported Seraphina. After all, most of them were members of the Glorious Divine Kingdom's Royal Family, its branch bloodlines, as well as generals and officials of the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all had more faith in Seraphina's strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, in major cities, most spectators were hoping Osborne could create a miracle, defeat Seraphina, and win the championship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Osborne represented ordinary people like them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If an ordinary person defeated a princess of the Royal Family and won the championship, they would feel honored too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Clara and Leroy below the stage were staring at Osborne in surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The first match is really between you and Seraphina," Clara said in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered inwardly, thinking, "I know the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom too well. They're all overly confident and arrogant."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They must have arranged such a matchup because it could lead to the best outcome for them, with the two princesses of the Royal Family taking the top two spots.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because they are too arrogant and confident, they wouldn't consider that such an arrangement could also lead to the worst outcome for them, where neither of the Royal Family's princesses makes it to the top three.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If the matchups were arranged normally, Seraphina could at least secure second place. But now..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They're finished!" Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he slowly walked toward the arena, his steps firm and steady.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He agreed with some of the audience's views, believing there was no real championship battle. Because from the moment he decided to win, the championship was already destined to be his.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as Seraphina had absolute confidence in herself, Osborne had absolute confidence in himself too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He believed that among warriors who hadn't reached Empyrean Sacredness, no one could defeat him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then let's see which of us is truly strong and who is just overconfident." Thinking this, Osborne stepped onto the arena first, quietly waiting for Seraphina, who had yet to come up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, Seraphina walked over as well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her steps were equally firm, her face full of confidence and composure. It was an absolute confidence, a dominance that could easily defeat any opponent no matter who they were.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her steps slowly ascended onto the arena.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a boom, the moment Seraphina stepped onto the arena, an incredibly terrifying energy erupted from her body, like a volcanic eruption or a planetary explosion. Instantly, it spread outward from her as the center, wildly exploding in all directions, engulfing everything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that instant, everyone watching felt their breath catch, and even those with cultivation levels far above Seraphina couldn't help but feel astonished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many people exclaimed, "Her energy is so powerful!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Her aura is terrifying!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this really the energy a young person who hasn't reached Empyrean Sacredness can possess?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Her strength is truly astonishing!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The eliminated ordinary contestants, upon sensing Seraphina's energy at this moment, couldn't help but show expressions of fear and even inferiority.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She is just too powerful!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They are all at Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King, but after Seraphina fully unleashed her power, they felt as if they were facing a warrior at Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just sensing her energy, they couldn't muster any fighting spirit, as if they would be effortlessly crushed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, even Clara and Leroy couldn't help but exchange a deeply serious glance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They knew they were indeed no match for Seraphina now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara said, "She's so strong!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were actually just affected by the aftermath of Seraphina's aura. At this moment, it was Osborne, standing on the other side of the arena, who was truly bearing the brunt of her overwhelming presence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne's expression remained incredibly calm. Even as Seraphina's terrifying energy stirred up fierce winds on the arena, ruffling his black clothes, his face showed no sign of change, as if he couldn't feel Seraphina's overwhelming power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation made Seraphina frown slightly. She unleashed her full energy as soon as she stepped onto the arena to crush Osborne's confidence, hoping to make him fearful before the fight even began.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But clearly, she failed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her terrifying energy had no effect on Osborne whatsoever.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina let out a cold snort, feeling a bit annoyed.</span></p><div class="pagination">
