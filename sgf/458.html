  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert lowered his head in disbelief, looking at the several bloody holes on his body. He was utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was disbelief in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a Class A martial master and had been a Class A master for more than ten years. Although he had not yet reached Class A+, he was a leader among the Class A masters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His martial art aura was potent, and his body was adamant. Even a metahuman of the same level could not easily hurt him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Osborne only used a pistol to pierce through his martial art aura and his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?" murmured Robert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next second, he felt an extreme crisis. He saw Osborne aiming at his head and pulled the trigger again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert dodged frantically. He was a Class A martial artist, and his dodging speed was breakneck. But the bullets from Osborne's energy pistol were even faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's more, predictive shooting was just a piece of cake for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he wanted, he could even change the direction of the energy bullet at will, making the energy bullet change direction again in mid-air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Robert was in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two energy bullets hit his head one after another, entering from his forehead and exiting from the back of his head. His body stopped in place instantly. But his strong vitality prevented him from dying immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just looked at Osborne and at the energy pistol in Osborne's hand, his face full of unwillingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could I possibly die from a pistol? I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, Robert's body fell heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was Alexander's father and the previous head of the Paltrow family. He had just given up the position of head of the Paltrow family to Alexander today, and he died just like that now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the Paltrow family members were terrified at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked at the energy pistol in Osborne's hand in fear and dared not attack anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Evelynn, Charlie, and others, who were far away, suddenly stood up and looked at the energy pistol in Osborne's hand in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell is that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie was shocked. "How can a pistol, even an energy pistol, possibly kill a Class A martial master? If a pistol had such power, who the hell would train so hard? Wouldn't it be better to just shoot at others with guns?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn took a deep breath. "That's not an ordinary energy pistol!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others all looked at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said quickly, "I heard from my brother that my family's research lab is researching a new type of energy weapon that is more like an ancient magic weapon. The user uses his own energy to pour into the weapon. After the weapon compresses it, it will be shot out specially, bursting out with terrifying penetrating power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This weapon is not powerful but has strong penetrating power. The energy strength of the user determines its power. The stronger the user's energy, the stronger the weapon's penetrating power. The energy pistol he used is probably this kind of weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But my family hasn't even succeeded in researching it yet. Where did he get his energy pistol from?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn frowned tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie also looked serious. "I don't know if we can block the attack of his energy pistol."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn smiled at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Are you scared? Don't worry. I've said that the most powerful thing about this energy pistol is its penetrating power! It is actually not that strong itself. As long as it doesn't penetrate you, it has almost no lethality."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn's face was filled with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie was surprised, saying, "Evelynn, are you sure you can block it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn sneered, "It's just a little penetrating power. For a true master, it's nothing! Just a bit of Stretch Soft Force can offset its penetrating power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she waved her hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a ball of energy appeared between her palms. It was strange and was rotating weirdly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just punch at it," said Evelynn to Charlie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie nodded and punched the ball of energy. But immediately, he found that his fist seemed to be stuck in a quagmire, and all his strength was dissipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is the Stretch Soft Force!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's an advanced martial arts technique, a very difficult technique. It is a pair with the Point Blank Force. Only the Point Blank Force can break through the Stretch Soft Force's defense. And only the Stretch Soft Force can defend against the Point Blank Force! It all depends on who has a higher degree of control."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her words, Charlie and the others showed envy in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had heard of Point Blank Force and Stretch Soft Force. But they had no one to teach them and no place to learn them. In Newport City, the only family that mastered Stretch Soft Force and Point Blank Force was the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or rather, only the Godfather mastered them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, this kind of powerful, advanced martial arts technique would not be easily passed on to outsiders. Evelynn was a direct descendant of the Augustine family, so she could learn Stretch Soft Force. But Charlie and others could not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Evelynn, as long as you can block it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie did not dwell on this issue and whispered, "Are we not going to take action? If that guy kills all the people in the Paltrow family, we can't snatch the divine artifact if we rely on ourselves!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We must rely on the power of the Paltrow family now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Evelynn started thinking quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated for a moment, gritting her teeth and saying, "A divine artifact is worth the risk! Now that we have come across it, we couldn't give up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Charlie, you strike him first!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
