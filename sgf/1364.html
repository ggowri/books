  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne spoke coldly, "So if I kill you, will that free her? Let her take control of her own body?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I may not like her, but I'd much prefer her in charge than you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe it's time I helped her lock you away in the memory palace!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Time paused, taken aback by his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a chilling laugh erupted from her lips, filled with pride and disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can kill me? You want to help her imprison me? That's rich!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She laughed heartily, her eyes glinting with arrogance. "Who gave you the nerve to say such things? Do you really think you stand a chance against me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am the God of Time, one of the most powerful Deity Kings of </span><span>Celestara</span><span>. Even at less than full strength, I could wipe you out without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In fact, if it weren't for her meddling, you'd already be dead! And now, you dare to challenge me? Hah! Even Lord Malevolence couldn't take me down back in the day. Your arrogance is laughable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But this works for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to kill you, and you want to kill me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see who gets the last laugh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the God of Time sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow. He had hoped to avoid a fight in the dimensional portal, but with her attacking first, he had no choice but to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Time? The top Deity King warrior?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So what?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right now, you're just a peak Transcendent Deity! You think you can take me down? That's truly a dream!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce determination, Osborne struck back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two clashed violently in the dimensional portal, each being pushed back several feet from the force of their attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Osborne and the God of Time stood stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You actually blocked my attack? And pushed me back? Your divine power and Divine Body are surprisingly strong! I admit, I underestimated you! Among peak Transcendent Deities, there are hardly any who can match me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Time's expression shifted, her gaze now serious as she regarded Osborne as a worthy opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a mix of surprise and apprehension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he was still only at the level of a Superior Deity, he could usually overpower any typical Transcendent Deity warrior with ease. Even the likes of Terrence and Apocalypse Harbinger wouldn't stand a chance against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had expected to easily dominate the God of Time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, here he was, struggling to gain the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Time, a fellow peak Transcendent Deity, was far stronger than he had anticipated. Ten </span><span>Terrences</span><span> or Apocalypse Harbingers wouldn't even come close to her power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "Impressive for a former top Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She's survived battles with Lord Malevolence and lived to tell the tale!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among peak Transcendent Deities, her strength dwarfs the rest! No wonder she's so confident in her ability to kill me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But too bad... she's misjudged my power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had cleverly concealed his Divine Flame using the Eclipsing Mantra, leading the God of Time to mistakenly assume he was a peak Transcendent Deity like herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she realized he was merely a Superior Deity, her confidence would surely falter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold laugh, Osborne said, "God of Time, you're not as formidable as you think! You can't kill me! Let's call it a day. </span><span>Celestara</span><span> is vast, and we probably won't cross paths again. I won't show my face around here, and you shouldn't come looking for me. Let's just go our separate ways."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Time sneered at him, her voice dripping with scorn. "What's this? Are you scared? Hoping I'll let you off the hook? Ha! You're dreaming. I told you; you must die today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow. "Is there no possibility of reconciliation? You must realize that this is a dimensional portal. If we engage in full combat, the portal will inevitably collapse, triggering a spatial tide!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The power of a spatial tide, you should be well aware, is far greater than I. With my spatial power, I might still survive, even navigate through it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you... you're more likely to be torn apart by the spatial tide. And even if you survive, there's a high chance you'll be forever lost in the depths of space."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was still making a last-ditch effort to dispel the animosity, not wanting to </span><span>engage in battle with the God of Time here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words, however, only led the God of Time to believe he was scared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sneered, saying, "Are you trying to intimidate me? Spatial tide, is that all? I am the God of Time; I've faced far more terrifying forces! A mere spatial tide trying to claim my life or make me lose my way?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're naive! You have no idea how powerful a top Deity King can be, nor the multitude of means at their disposal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, the spatial tide will shred you but leave me unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"On the other hand, your words have reminded me. If I kill you personally, Ophelia might find it hard to forgive me and refuse to merge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if you die in a spatial tide, that becomes none of my concern."</span></p><div class="pagination">
