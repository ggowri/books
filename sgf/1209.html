  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the days that followed, Osborne found himself busier than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be precise, the entire Augustine family was caught up in a whirlwind of activity, each member diligently executing Osborne's various commands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most significant task at hand was a complete overhaul of the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the surface, everything appeared unchanged. The Augustine family remained the same, with its nine towering peaks dominating a three-mile radius, all surrounding the central Mount Celestial Reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, deep beneath the ground, everything had transformed dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, accompanied by countless warriors, had excavated an immense underground realm six miles below the surface, which resembled a small city!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using advanced materials, they fortified this subterranean world, turning it into an impregnable fortress capable of withstanding even the most powerful earthquakes without a scratch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne named this underground marvel the Augustine Bastion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its structure resembled a pyramid, consisting of twenty-eight levels, each towering over a hundred yards high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The topmost level spanned about 100 thousand square feet, serving as Osborne's residence and training ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the event of an attack on the Augustine Bastion, he would be the first to sense it, allowing him to respond swiftly and safeguard the fortress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The peculiar stone he had discovered was placed directly above the Augustine Bastion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For one, Osborne realized this stone was incredibly hard, nearly indestructible, much like the Goddess of Grain's scythe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Positioning it above the Bastion added another layer of protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Additionally, this location was the closest to where he trained, ensuring Osborne could harness the densest cosmic energy available.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every member of the Augustine family was assigned their own room within the Augustine Bastion. Thanks to that strange stone, the cosmic energy in the Bastion was exceptionally rich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The higher one went, the more potent the energy became.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, along with his grandfather Sebastian, sister Anastasia, and Zoe, occupied the top floor, enjoying the richest cosmic energy available.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Below them were Matthew, Bryce, Kendra, and others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In total, the upper five levels housed tens of thousands of Augustine family members, including those from the Blood Demon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beneath these living quarters lay a massive training facility specifically designed for </span><span>the Draco Armed Services Branch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lower levels of the Augustine Bastion were dedicated to the various research institutes of the Draco Group, including weapons production lines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Weapons Research Institute, the Materials Research Institute, the Medical Research Institute, and the Technology Research Institute all occupied these lower levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the most exciting projects was the enormous cocoon that Osborne had acquired after defeating the Dark Deity; it now resided in the Materials Research Institute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This cocoon was made from a material with astonishing defensive capabilities&mdash;Osborne's full-force strike had failed to leave a mark on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they could fully understand this material, it could be used to create defensive inner armor for every member of the Blood Demon and Draco Armed Services Branch, significantly boosting their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coating the outer walls of the Augustine Bastion with this material would transform it into an impenetrable fortress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was eager to see what they could achieve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the research on the super energy gun was also progressing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Weapons Research Institute was working on a more powerful version, and they were already seeing promising results. It wouldn't be long before they could produce a super energy gun with even more devastating firepower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In summary, everything was moving in a positive direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After several days of relentless effort, Osborne finally arrived at the top level of the Augustine Bastion, ready to embark on a new phase of training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time to merge with the third step of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity!" he muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Osborne, this fusion was nothing short of crucial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could succeed, the energy roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity would infiltrate the bodies of the Blood Demon members, dramatically enhancing their strength and granting them a simplified form of immortality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the Blood Demon organization would truly become an indomitable legion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to Cain's memories, Osborne understood the intricacies of completing the third step of the fusion. Yet, he was uncertain&mdash;could his current Divine Body withstand the fusion's immense power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought sent a shiver down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he failed, death would be his only outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to Cain, reaching the third step of the fusion required at least the strength of a Transcendent Deity; only such a body could bear the force unleashed during the merger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had unwavering confidence in his Divine Body, but could it really rival the Divine Bodies of Transcendent Deity warriors?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The question gnawed at him, leaving him without a solid answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, Osborne resolved to give it a shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, an urgent message pierced through his thoughts&mdash;Bryce's voice crackled over his communicator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather, I just received word that the Rosmandi's financial center, Hearin City, is under siege by a massive Beast Tide! A large number of Class S Dark Exotic Beasts are attacking!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
