  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Abner stood in the arena with unshakable confidence and fierce determination.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Having witnessed Osborne's battle with Cuthbert firsthand, he was convinced that Cuthbert's loss had more to do with exhaustion than with Osborne's strength. Cuthbert had fought nearly fifty grueling matches, leaving him depleted and far from his peak.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, Osborne's Light Realm was exceptionally solid, and Cuthbert had struggled to break through it quickly, wasting his energy in the process.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On top of that, Cuthbert hadn't anticipated that Osborne could instantly heal from severe injuries and return to peak condition.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In Abner's view, Osborne's abilities paled in comparison to Cuthbert's, and he believed they were even inferior to his own.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With the advantage of his divine artifact, Abner was certain he could shatter Osborne's Light Realm with ease.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm going to reclaim the honor of the Williamson family!" Abner declared, his aura radiating with power.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne gave a faint smile. "I'm afraid you might be overestimating yourself."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without further ado, Osborne launched an attack with a powerful punch aimed straight at Abner.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Abner snorted and swung his divine artifact sword swiftly. The blade's terrifying aura flashed brightly, repelling Osborne and even slicing through his martial art aura defense, leaving a shallow cut on his skin.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's eyes widened in surprise. "Such a sharp divine artifact!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Abner sneered, saying, "Now you're scared? Too late for that! I'm going to humiliate you just like you did to Cuthbert. Prepare to lose!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Abner moved with lightning speed, swinging his sword with deadly precision. The fierce blade lights engulfed Osborne, who grunted and used his Stretch Soft Force to block the attacks.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though he appeared somewhat disheveled, Osborne managed to keep his body unscathed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Abner's expression turned serious. "You've got some skills, but I'm still going to beat you! That was just a warm-up; now I'm getting serious!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a shout, Abner raised his divine artifact sword high and brought it down with tremendous force.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The blade's aura stretched a full hundred yards, seeming capable of cleaving through anything in its path.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smirked. "Is it just you with a divine artifact? Perfect timing. I've got one, too, courtesy of the Williamson family!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Osborne summoned the Volt Hammer from his Dimensional Space.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he gripped the hammer, a powerful current surged through his body, but thanks to his Thunder Power, he could handle it with ease.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He swung the Volt Hammer with precision.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A massive bolt of lightning erupted from the hammer, shattering Abner's blade lights and continuing with relentless force towards him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Abner's face turned pale as the lightning struck with blinding speed. He barely had time to react and could only raise his divine artifact sword to block.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The lightning crashed into the sword with explosive force, overwhelming Abner. The fierce energy enveloped him in a storm of crackling electricity.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Argh!" Abner screamed in agony as he was thrown backward, crashing hard onto the arena floor, his body scorched black.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne watched in astonishment.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is it really that powerful?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking down at the Volt Hammer, Osborne marveled, "I intended only to block Abner's attack, but the Volt Hammer's power exceeded my expectations. Not only did it destroy Abner's attack, but it also severely injured him. Indeed, a Premium divine artifact lives up to its reputation!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne felt pleased.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Volt Hammer crackled with raw power in his hands, but the relentless electric currents coursing through his body made it unbearable. Osborne had no choice but to quickly stash the Volt Hammer away into the Dimensional Space.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite this, its impact had already left the Williamson family in stunned disbelief.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How... how is this possible?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've wielded the Volt Hammer before, and just holding it nearly incapacitated me. The lightning strikes it unleashed were nothing compared to this!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's using it with such ease?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And the power... it's devastating!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This can't be real!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Williamson family members gaped at Osborne in shock, their eyes wide with disbelief and fury.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Abner, now blackened and looking utterly defeated, struggled to his feet.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His body was shaking, and his voice trembled with frustration.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How... how did you manage this? Why didn't the Volt Hammer injure you? How is its power so immense in your hands? This is impossible!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Abner's eyes were bloodshot with rage.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne merely smiled, saying, "Who knows? But I have to say, I'm quite pleased with the Volt Hammer you sent me! Especially since it helped me put a serious hurt on you. And now, you're about to be defeated, too!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It looks like you owe me another divine artifact!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Osborne moved again.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Spatial Prison! Prepare to lose!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He trapped Abner with Spatial Prison and delivered a powerful punch to his foe's chest.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Abner was severely injured, unable to defend himself.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He vomited blood as he was sent flying, crashing down below the arena.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Osborne had already seized Abner's divine artifact, the massive battle blade, into his possession.</p><div class="pagination">
