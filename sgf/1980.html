  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on a second, Grandpa!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've sealed off Bram and Trevor's memories, but I haven't had a chance to look into them yet. There's bound to be evidence of the Baxter family's betrayal of the Human Community in their memories. Once I sort it out, you can go talk to the God of Light," Osborne said, his tone urgent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Memories? You can actually seal their memories? What kind of trick is that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and pointed to his left eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's my ability, the Satan's Eye! I can't explain it in detail, but it works.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For now, just send a message to Uncle Zachary and the others so they don't worry, and then wait for me to finish up with their memories."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro nodded, excitement bubbling within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had long suspected the Baxter family had betrayed the Human Community, but he struggled to find proof. After all, the Baxter family had been fighting against the Dark Deity Legion on the border battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they hadn't suffered as many losses as the Hudson family, they still had warriors who fell in battle against the Dark Deity Legion, and their contributions on the battlefield were even greater than those of the Hudson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of this, no one took his suspicions seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with Bram's appearance, Jethro was now convinced of the Baxter family's betrayal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, that alone wasn't enough evidence. Bram had self-destructed, leaving no remains, and the Baxter family could easily claim that his actions were personal and didn't reflect their loyalties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, Bram attacking him wouldn't prove the Baxter family's betrayal. If he could find more concrete evidence in Bram and Trevor's memories, it would be perfect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After contacting Zachary and the others, Jethro settled down to wait patiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Osborne worked on organizing the memories, he asked, "Grandpa, tell me about the meeting called by the God of Light."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro's expression turned serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, the esteemed God of Light summoned us to discuss strategies for countering the Dark Deity Legion! You probably know that the Dark Deity Legion is gathering forces from all over to launch an assault on the border battlefield in the West Zone. Lord Malevolence and the Paramount Supreme Clan are dead set on wiping out our Human Community in the West Zone and completely dominating Celestara!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we lose, we'll be forever enslaved to Lord Malevolence, mere vassals of the Paramount Supreme Clan, with no hope of ever rising again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, even though we're outmatched, we must fight tooth and nail!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, understanding the gravity of the situation. "What was the outcome of your discussions? What did the God of Light decide?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Delay! That's the plan!" Jethro replied, his voice steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Delay?" Osborne raised an eyebrow, surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro explained, "That's what we came up with after deliberating, and it's what the esteemed God of Light confirmed! The strength of our Human Community coalition pales in comparison to Lord Malevolence's Dark Deity Legion. The disparity in numbers and power is staggering!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the Dark Deity Legion decides to launch a full-scale war, we'd be crushed in an instant, like a tidal wave sweeping away everything in its path! A lot of our coalition would perish on the battlefield!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, the only option we have is to buy ourselves some time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow, thinking to himself, "Is the gap really that enormous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could clearly sense the helplessness and despair in Jethro's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How exactly are we supposed to buy time? Do you really think the Dark Deity Legion will let us stall? And what's the point of dragging things out?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro chuckled, "It's actually quite simple! You see, the folks from the Paramount Supreme Clan are incredibly proud. They believe their clan is noble and that we, the Human Community, are beneath them. They think they're superior to us in every way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, all we need to do is exploit their arrogance. We'll set up a challenge on the border battlefield, laying down the rules to confront the Paramount Supreme Clan. Their pride will compel them to accept the challenge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This idea was inspired by the esteemed God of Light, who learned from your earlier challenges against the younger warriors of various races in the East Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So this time, the esteemed God of Light will step forward to issue a challenge to the Paramount Supreme Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The specifics are still being worked out, but the God of Light seems quite confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's asked us to return home and select our most talented individuals capable of facing higher-level opponents, getting them ready for battle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a twinge of doubt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Can challenging the Paramount Supreme Clan really buy us time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was still unsure of the God of Light's plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the bigger question loomed&mdash;what was the purpose of this delay?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if the God of Light had a way to postpone the onset of full-scale war, what difference would it make?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they managed to stall for a few months or even years, what would change?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power gap between the Human Community coalition and the Dark Deity Legion was simply too vast. No amount of delay could turn the tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimately, the Human Community would be crushed under the relentless wave of the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro sensed Osborne's confusion and quickly addressed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The purpose of the delay... is to wait for the esteemed God of Night!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's been missing for over twenty years!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only his return can give the Human Community a glimmer of hope! When it comes down to it, the outcome of this war won't be decided by the Dark Deity Legion or even our coalition; it will hinge on the battle between the esteemed God of Night and Lord Malevolence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Lord Malevolence defeats him, the Human Community is doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if the God of Night triumphs over Lord Malevolence... then we might just be saved!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right now, no one knows where the God of Night is, not even the esteemed God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But she has said that the God of Night will return soon. Our task is to buy as much time as possible, to minimize our losses before his arrival..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne fell silent, absorbing the weight of Jethro's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "The God of Night!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Again, it all comes back to him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that all hope for the Human Community rested on the God of Night's shoulders. Everyone was counting on him to save them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is the God of Night really that powerful?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fists clenched tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne recalled Isa&mdash;she was a disciple of the God of Night!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa had even proclaimed publicly that she was the God of Night's woman!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time he thought of this, it felt like a knife twisting in his heart, filling him with a mix of pain and anger towards the God of Night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So we're just going to bide our time, waiting for the God of Night to return? Hoping he'll save the Human Community? The last flicker of hope&mdash;the God of Night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's lips pressed, defiance burning in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph! It's not just the God of Night who can save the Human Community! I can do it too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a fierce determination ignited within him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
