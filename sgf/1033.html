  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the number of enemies dwindled, the pressure on Osborne eased significantly. Even when the remaining foes banded together to attack, they couldn't break through his martial art aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The transformation had revealed its true power&mdash;Osborne was untouchable, while his strikes were lethal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene was bizarre.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Class AAA warrior was relentlessly hunting down a group of Class S clones who were completely unable to fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone witnessing this would be left speechless; it was rare for even a Class S to handle a group of Class AAA with such ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Ahhh</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the last Wolf King met its end under Osborne's hammer; its massive head shattered into a gruesome mix of blood and brains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne breathed wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fight hadn't been tough; Bryce had drawn the bulk of the enemy's attention, making things much easier than Osborne had anticipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that didn't mean he was without fatigue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every move he made was a full-powered effort, so now he felt the ache in his arms and the depletion of his mental strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was no time to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was in a hurry to eliminate these Class S clones because he could see Bryce was struggling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce was up against twenty-six Class S clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief initial burst of energy, he had been forced into a defensive position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it was a losing battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, they were fighting in the vast ocean, which boosted Bryce's water elemental power. Plus, thanks to the Crystal of Life Osborne had given him, he was managing to recover soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, Bryce wouldn't have lasted this long; he would've been dead long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Bryce was in rough shape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, he could hurl insults at his enemies, but now he was being tossed around like a rag doll, barely able to catch a breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce spat another mouthful of blood, his face as pale as a sheet. Everywhere ached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce thought, "Damn it! I'm </span><span>gonna</span><span> die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why the hell did I push my luck? Osborne told me to hold off twenty enemies, and what did I do? I went and attracted twenty-six!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He regretted that decision, big time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing twenty or twenty-six enemies might not seem like a huge difference, but the </span><span>intensity was on a whole different level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had a second chance, Bryce wouldn't make that mistake again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce was sent flying again, feeling like he was on the brink of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the Crystal of Life was replenishing his vitality, it wasn't enough to heal his wounds in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't even have time to check on what was happening with Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, if you don't come and save me soon, I'm toast! But then again, you're a Class AAA facing off against twenty-five Class S guys. You're probably in worse shape than I am&mdash;maybe you've already kicked the bucket!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he struggled to defend himself, his thoughts began to drift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, just when he thought all hope was lost, he saw a figure leap in front of him, blocking all incoming attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce's jaw dropped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne flashed a casual smile. "Mr. Clarkson, I'm still alive! And I'm not in that bad of shape&mdash;just warming up here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce's eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced in another direction, and his eyes met the grisly scene of over twenty corpses scattered on the ground, most with their skulls crushed to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn!" Bryce gasped, stunned by the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "How long has it been? Osborne has already taken down over twenty Class S clones?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And by the looks of it, he barely got a scratch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is Osborne even human?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We each faced over twenty enemies. I'm a Class S, and Osborne's just a Class AAA. I can't even take down a single enemy; I'm just defending and getting pummeled, battered and bruised, almost at death's door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne has wiped them all out?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why the gap is so huge?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce was dumbfounded. He knew Osborne was a prodigy who had topped the Godson Rankings and flawlessly cleared the Honor Quest Ceremony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over two centuries, only four individuals had ever perfectly cleared the Honor Quest Ceremony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even so, Bryce hadn't imagined Osborne would be this insanely powerful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Clarkson, snap out of it! Can you still fight? Let's work together and finish them off before something goes wrong!" Osborne urged, snapping Bryce back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne effortlessly deflecting the attacks of over twenty Class S clones with nothing but martial art aura and still managing to talk, Bryce was utterly convinced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly replied, "I'm good to go!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These motherfuckers just had their way with me. Now that you're here, I finally get my revenge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's kill '</span><span>em</span><span> all!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
