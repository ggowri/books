  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley got crazy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's words thoroughly </span><span>pushed his buttons</span><span>. Wesley, who was already furious, suddenly tore Ophelia's clothes frantically</span><span> like a mad beast</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to prove to Ophelia that he was a man</span><span>, and that he was stronger than Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the Caldwell family watched helplessly as Ophelia was about to be raped, but they were stopped by the Ashford family, unable to save her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Ashford family was one of the most prominent families in Mayby City, much more powerful than the Caldwell family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia wanted to marry Wesley because she wanted to use the power of the Ashford family to prosper the Caldwell family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, she paid the price for her actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Asshole! Let me go!</span><span> </span><span>Wesley, you are a coward! You bastard! You are nothing compared to Osborne!</span><span> </span><span>If you dare to touch me, I'll kill you no matter what!</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jerk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's scolding did not discourage Wesley but made him even more furious and excited. His eyes turned red, and his breathing became heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bitch! Go ahead!</span><span> "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The more you scold me, the more excited I will be. Soon, I will turn your scolding into moans of pleasure!</span><span> </span><span>Just enjoy it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley </span><span>couldn&rsquo;t wait any longer</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia was wearing a gorgeous wedding dress</span><span> with a</span><span> very complicated</span><span> design</span><span>. He tore at it for a long time but failed to pull it completely open, which caused him to be even more enraged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how complicated a wedding dress was, it would eventually be torn apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Ophelia was about to be raped in public by Wesley, Evelyn, who was not far away, opened her mouth wide, completely stunned by the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body was shaking violently. She clenched her fists and looked incredibly worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had to save Ophelia!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what, she was Ophelia's stepmother. Although the two of them were not much different in age, they got on well with each other, even more like sisters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't bear to watch Ophelia being </span><span>assaulted just like that</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she was just a weak woman. </span><span>She couldn&rsquo;t possibly stop Wesley all on her own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn was brainstorming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a </span><span>light bulb went off in her head</span><span>, and she felt like she had grabbed a faint glimmer of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!</span><span> </span><span>Contact Osborne immediately. Only he can save Ophelia now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn thought so, quickly took out her cell phone, and sent a message for help to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she felt that Osborne would most likely turn a blind eye to her message for help, somehow, she could only think of Osborne at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She believed that only Osborne could save Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After sending the message, Evelyn made up her mind. While no one in the Ashford family was paying attention to her, she picked up a chair and smashed it hard at Wesley from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go of Ophelia!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn exerted all her strength, and the solid wooden chair hit</span><span> the back of</span><span> Wesley's head hard and then bounced away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley staggered a bit but did not faint. Blood instantly flowed from his head and onto his hideous face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned around slowly, wiped the blood off his face, and looked at Evelyn ferociously. His face was twitching, fury and murderous intent surging wildly on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you! Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley slapped Evelyn hard. Evelyn fell to the ground with a bang and coughed out a mouthful of blood from her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She got frightened but didn't regret it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked straight at Wesley and gritted her teeth. "Wesley, Ophelia is right. You're useless! </span><span>You coward</span><span>! </span><span>You&rsquo;re</span><span> from a prominent family</span><span>. So, what? It</span><span> doesn't change that. You're nothing compared to Osborne!</span><span> "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill us if you</span><span> dare</span><span>!</span><span> </span><span>Someone will avenge us anyway!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her words, Wesley trembled even more violently due to rage. With blood all over his face, he looked like a demon with a ferocious and terrifying expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked up to Evelyn, grabbed her hair, and lifted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn looked in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she still looked Wesley in the eye and cursed, "Jerk! You are a coward! </span><span>You only dare to lay a finger on women</span><span>! If you are capable, you should prove your ability like Osborne instead of just beating women!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll fucking kill you!"</span><span> Wesley growled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn mentioned Osborne again and again, which completely drove Wesley crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will kill you first, and then I will kill Osborne!</span><span> </span><span>You all will go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing speaking angrily, he waved his hand fiercely and asked a bodyguard to come over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he snatched the pistol from the bodyguard, opened the safety, and pointed it at Evelyn's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cursed, his expression ferocious, "I will shoot you now! Then, I will rape Ophelia, and finally, I will kill Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to pull the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other side, at the Radcliffe Manor, Osborne was holding Clarissa's hand and walking with her in the garden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They both enjoyed the time together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa leaned her head on Osborne's shoulder. There was no longer any indifference on her face. Instead, she looked tender and delighted, with a happy smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't anticipate what the future would be like, but now, she did enjoy it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Osborne's phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He checked it, and his face turned stern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person who sent him the message was actually Evelyn</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn&rsquo;t help wondering why his ex-mother-in-law did so.</span></p><div class="pagination">
