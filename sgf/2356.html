  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You really made a good choice," Primordial said speechlessly. "That shield is definitely the strongest among these four Sacred Artifacts. Even though it's restricted to the level of a low-grade Sacred Artifact, it's still harder to deal with than the other three. Do you think it's not challenging enough and want to make it harder for yourself?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then he added, "I think you should challenge that battle blade."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Osborne smiled and said, "I know that shield is the strongest, but I still want to challenge it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne stepped into the range of the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne felt a wave of dizziness and found himself on the virtual arena. The projection of the Sacred Artifact-level shield was right in front of him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a swallowtail-shaped shield. Slightly convex in the middle, narrower at the top and bottom, with a flat upper edge and a swallowtail-like lower edge. The front was engraved with the Warfare Ancient Tree, seemingly with black mist flowing within, exuding the exact same aura as the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The shield was entirely black, but green light flickered across it. It wasn&rsquo;t large, clearly a one-handed shield, barely covering a third of Osborne's body, without giving off a bulky impression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll call you Warfare Shield," Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He chose the Warfare Shield as his opponent for the trial after carefully considering all his circumstances.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His greatest advantage is his strong attack power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Compared to his attack power, his defense is average. Compared to Agatha with the Phoenix Skeletal Shield, his defense is quite poor. Especially when he can't use the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, he can only rely on Sacred Power and his own body for defense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When facing enemies, Osborne mostly relies on his powerful attack to directly defeat opponents, leaving no chance for them to test his defense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the Sacred Artifacts on the Warfare Ancient Tree, the battleship is the most formidable, excelling in both offense and defense. The spear was chosen by Primordial, so it must be extraordinary, with undoubtedly strong attack power. The war sword is probably similar to the spear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne worries that his defense might not withstand the spear and the war sword. After all, he only has one chance for the trial. If he fails, things will get troublesome.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Warfare Shield is a Defensive Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, its attack power is definitely not strong. Osborne doesn&rsquo;t need to worry about being defeated; all he needs to do is give his all to break through the Warfare Shield&rsquo;s defense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he can break through the Warfare Shield's defense, he will win. Otherwise, he will lose.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Warfare Shield will be suppressed to a low-grade Sacred Artifact. I don't believe I can't break its defense." Osborne stared at the Warfare </span><span>Shield,</span><span> his eyes full of fighting spirit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, the Warfare Ancient Tree said in his mind, "The trial begins."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the Warfare Shield began to unleash immense power. The phantom of the Warfare Ancient Tree on the shield suddenly focused, and a faint mist enveloped the Warfare Shield.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this the Warfare Mist?" Osborne was utterly astonished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "The Warfare Shield can indeed release Warfare Mist like the Warfare Ancient Tree. However, the Warfare Mist released by the Warfare Shield is noticeably thinner compared to that of the Warfare Ancient Tree. So, its defense can't be that strong."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, Osborne could just admit defeat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, he used the Ascending Sacred Sanctum and burned fifty thousand Sacred Crystals to break through the previous Warfare Mist. If relying solely on his own strength, it would have been impossible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After all, it's just a low-grade Sacred Artifact for now. The Warfare Mist it releases won't be particularly strong." Thinking this, Osborne began to take action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Holding the Bloodwrought Bow, Osborne didn't hesitate. He unleashed his full Sacred Power, forming a brilliant Sacred Power Arrow that shot out at incredible speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The power of the Sacred Power Arrow was terrifying. Although this arrow didn't incorporate the Divine Ascendance Technique, among those participating in the state duel, fewer than twenty could withstand it, while the rest would be instantly defeated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Osborne was very confident in this arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Sacred Power Arrow instantly appeared in front of the Warfare Shield, then blasted into the Warfare Mist, producing an incredibly terrifying explosion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Sacred Power Arrow shattered instantly, while the Warfare Mist kept surging but remained stable, unbroken.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was instantly surprised, thinking, "Does it really have such strong defense? My arrow just now didn't completely break the Warfare Mist, only slightly shook it, without causing even a single gap."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His expression grew serious. He thought, "Then I'll try firing ten arrows at once."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne drew the Bloodwrought Bow once again. He still didn't integrate the Divine Ascendance Technique into the Sacred Power Arrow, merely unleashed Sacred Power wildly, forming ten Sacred Power Arrows.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ten Sacred Power Arrows shot out simultaneously, striking the same spot on the Warfare Mist one after another. It triggered an incredibly terrifying energy surge, causing the Warfare Mist to shake violently, as if it could break at any moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the stability of the Warfare Mist exceeded Osborne's expectations. Even under such circumstances, the Warfare Mist remained unbroken, not even showing a single gap.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, Osborne was truly shocked, thinking, "I can't believe I couldn't break it even with ten arrows at once?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it were in a state duel, Osborne confidently believed that aside from a few like Agatha and Horace, no one else could withstand this move.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But it couldn't break through the Warfare Mist released by the Warfare Shield at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even so, the Warfare Shield had already been restricted to a low-grade Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Once again!" Osborne was a bit excited at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The stronger the Warfare Shield, the happier he was, because he had already regarded this Warfare Shield as his own.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This Warfare Shield was definitely stronger than Agatha's Phoenix Skeletal Shield.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least, when facing the Phoenix Skeletal Shield, Osborne didn&rsquo;t feel it was this tricky.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, Osborne fused the Divine Ascendance Technique into the Sacred Power Arrow and directly shot ten arrows at once.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Apart from Dimensional Maw, Osborne infused all the Divine Ascendance Techniques he mastered, including Spatial Oblivion Slash, Abyssal Echoes of the Drakes, Multi-thunder Chainstorm, Tempestuous Celestial Bolt Descent, into the Sacred Power Arrow. At this moment, the ten Sacred Power Arrows emitted incredibly terrifying energy waves.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Even if Agatha uses the Phoenix Skeletal Shield, these ten arrows might not be stopped. Let me see how strong your defense really is."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the ten terrifying arrows shot out, striking the Warfare Mist once again. But something that shocked Osborne happened. Amid the intense vibrations, the Warfare Mist completely absorbed and withstood the power of the ten arrows, without even a single breach.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath, feeling both happy and sad.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was happy because the strength of the Warfare Shield exceeded his expectations. If he could pass the test of the Warfare Ancient Tree, he would obtain the Warfare Shield, compensating for his ordinary defense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was sad because he had given it his all, yet still couldn't break through the defense of the Warfare Shield.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked very serious, thinking, "Is my attack power really this weak?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Looks like I can only use my ultimate move. If you can still withstand this, then I really have no other way." After saying this, Osborne took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A Sacred Power Arrow quickly formed on the Bloodwrought Bow. Its shape was strange, not an arrow, but a black sphere.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne infused Dimensional Maw, one of the Divine Ascendance Techniques he mastered, into the Sacred Power Arrow, creating the Maw Arrow!</span></p><div class="pagination">
