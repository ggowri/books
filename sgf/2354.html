  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are there more Warfare Ancient Trees there? The aura is stronger? Could those fruits be quasi-Sacred Artifacts?" Osborne said excitedly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha was also quite shocked. In her view, supreme divine artifact-level Fruit Battleships weren't very valuable. However, if they were quasi-Sacred Artifacts, that would be a different story.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even on the Racial Convergence Planet, not everyone could possess a quasi-Sacred Artifact. Only the more outstanding disciples of Second-rate Powers could own one.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A single quasi-Sacred Artifact costs at least a thousand Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If the fruits borne by the Warfare Ancient Tree are at the quasi-Sacred Artifact level, their value would be immense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Quasi-Sacred Artifact?" Primordial looked at Osborne with disdain and said, "Can you be a bit bolder? Fruits of a Warfare Ancient Tree at the quasi-Sacred Artifact level are nothing. I feel the fruits of those Warfare Ancient Trees in the distance could reach the Sacred Artifact level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fruits of a Warfare Ancient Tree at the Sacred Artifact level?" Osborne was shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He immediately activated Satan's Eye to look into the distance. Unfortunately, he couldn't see anything, as if a layer of mist was obscuring his vision.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said, "Stop looking. That's Warfare Mist. It's a smoke-like substance released by the Warfare Ancient Tree, not only possessing strong defensive capabilities but also concealing any external probing. Even if your Satan's Eye reached the Sacredness Level, you still wouldn't see through the Warfare Mist."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Precisely because of the Warfare Mist, I suspect there are fruits of a Warfare Ancient Tree at the Sacred Artifact level there. After all, a Warfare Ancient Tree capable of releasing Warfare Mist is already considered mature. If its fruits haven't been picked by others, they must be at the Sacred Artifact level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Osborne became even more excited. "Then what are we waiting for? We can go right now. I really didn't expect us to be this lucky. That powerful Chrono-Spatial Turbulence actually brought us to such a great place."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne walked toward the distant Warfare Mist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha quickly followed him. She was also full of anticipation, thinking, "Will the Warfare Ancient Tree really bear fruits at the Sacred Artifact level? If it does, then we're incredibly lucky."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the Racial Convergence Planet, even the most ordinary Sacred Artifact is worth at least a million Sacred Crystals. The stronger the Sacred Artifact, the higher its value, sometimes even priceless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, they arrived in front of the Warfare Mist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne touched it with his hand and found that the Warfare Mist was like a defensive shield, incredibly strong. Even if Osborne used his full strength, it was difficult to break through.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He immediately frowned deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can't do it either," Agatha tried and shook her head. "The Warfare Mist's defense is very strong."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's enter the Ascending Sacred Sanctum," Primordial said. "The Warfare Mist produced by Warfare Ancient Trees, which can bear Sacred Artifact-level fruits, isn't something you two, who haven't even reached Empyrean Sacredness, can break through. Only the Ascending Sacred Sanctum can penetrate the Warfare Mist."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and then summoned the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Subsequently, Osborne burned fifty thousand Sacred Crystals to power the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, finally breaking through the Warfare Mist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They successfully entered the Warfare Mist and finally saw the hidden Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne showed a look of shock and joy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The heartache from spending fifty thousand Sacred Crystals vanished completely, leaving only joy in his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Within the Warfare Mist stood a Warfare Ancient Tree ten times larger than any they had seen before. Its leaves were sparse, only a few hundred, but each leaf was a massive battleship. The aura emanating from them was even stronger than the Fruit Battleships Osborne had obtained earlier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those were quasi-Sacred Artifact-level Leaf Warships.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hundreds of quasi-Sacred Artifact-level Leaf Warships nearly took Osborne's breath away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, purchasing the most basic quasi-Sacred Artifact requires over a thousand Sacred Crystals, and the value of a quasi-Sacred Artifact-level battleship is at least ten times that of an ordinary quasi-Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, these hundreds of quasi-Sacred Artifact-level Leaf Warships are worth at least several million Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, Osborne felt that the weapons, armor, and warships produced by the Warfare Ancient Tree were much stronger than other weapons, armor, and warships of the same level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The value of just these hundreds of quasi-Sacred Artifact-level Leaf Warships was enough to make Osborne's breath quicken.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, what truly surprised Osborne was that there were four fruits hanging on this Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the aura emanating from these four fruits was incredibly powerful. It was the aura of a Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In other words, this Warfare Ancient Tree had four Sacred Artifact-level fruits.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were a warship, a spear, a shield, and a broadsword.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Four Sacred Artifacts!" Agatha was stunned, her face full of disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said in shock, "There really are Sacred Artifacts growing from trees in this world. On the Racial Convergence Planet, only powerful First-rate Powers possess the methods to forge Sacred Artifacts. However, crafting a Sacred Artifact is extremely difficult. Just gathering all the rare materials takes a huge amount of time. The forging process is even more troublesome, and a single mistake could lead to failure."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's why Sacred Artifacts are so expensive. But here, they can actually grow on trees. Moreover, I feel these four Sacred Artifacts are anything but ordinary."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha stared intently at the four Sacred Artifacts and continued, "A Sacred Artifact-level warship, even if it's the most basic, is worth ten times the price of an ordinary Sacred Artifact. But I feel this Sacred Artifact-level warship is even stronger than typical ones."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"On Celestara Planet, even many Second-rate Powers can't afford a Sacred Artifact-level warship. If we put this Sacred Artifact-level warship up for auction, it would definitely fetch a high price, at least tens of millions of Sacred Crystals."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, Osborne's eyes widened as he thought, "Is that Sacred Artifact-level warship really worth tens of millions of Sacred Crystals?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha added, "That spear and that saber are not simple either. I feel their aura rivals that of a mid-grade Sacred Artifact. However, the most precious is that shield."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That shield is at the very center, growing on the trunk of the Warfare Ancient Tree. It carries the patterns and aura of the Warfare Ancient Tree."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I think the defensive power of this shield is probably comparable to my Phoenix Skeletal Shield. Among mid-grade Sacred Artifacts, it&rsquo;s definitely one of the best, even comparable to a top-grade Sacred Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? Comparable to a top-grade Sacred Artifact?" Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sacred Artifacts, like divine artifacts, are divided into low-grade Sacred Artifact, mid-grade Sacred Artifact, top-grade Sacred Artifact, Ultimate Sacred Artifact, and supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's Bloodwrought Bow is actually a low-grade Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, because it is connected to Osborne's bloodline, it can unleash greater power in his hands. For Osborne, the Bloodwrought Bow is comparable to a mid-grade Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most of the Sacred Artifacts Osborne has seen are actually just low-grade Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only Agatha's Phoenix Cry Bone Flute and Phoenix Skeletal Shield, as well as Horace's Frost-invoking Canvas, are mid-grade Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, they are among the best of the mid-grade Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But because Agatha and Horace aren't strong enough, they can't fully unleash the power of the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute, Phoenix Skeletal Shield, and Frost-invoking Canvas.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even so, they still made the two </span><span>rank</span><span> among the top in state duels.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Agatha says the Sacred Artifact-level shield on the Warfare Ancient Tree is similar to her Phoenix Skeletal Shield, possibly even stronger, comparable to a top-grade Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "I'm going to strike it rich this time!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
