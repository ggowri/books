  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana's eyes widened with surprise as she heard Eugene's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Eugene Royston, has the Demonic Dragon Clan already prepared to strike against the Mystic Feather Clan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene glanced at Tiana dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mind your own business, Tiana! But yes, you'll soon see the outcome. In no time, Wild Flame City will be dominated by only two superior races&mdash;the Demonic Dragon Clan and the Soaring Lion Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the Mystic Feather Clan, they've been foolish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone from their ranks has angered a powerful genius from the Paramount Supreme Clan, and now that genius seeks to deal with them. We Demonic Dragon Clan are merely stepping in to help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana looked utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone from the Mystic Feather Clan enraged a genius of the Paramount Supreme Clan? Who would dare?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Paramount Supreme Clan, although technically part of the Human Community, was not seen as such.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were known as the Paramount Supreme Clan, descendants of Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Lord Malevolence's command were numerous other races, including ten superior ones, but even these dared not provoke the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To do so would be to provoke Lord Malevolence himself&mdash;a sure path to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How bold and foolish could someone from the Mystic Feather Clan be? Did it happen here in Wild Flame City?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene remained calm. "I don't know the specifics, but it's likely someone from our Mystic Feather Clan here in Wild Flame City who stirred up the genius from the Paramount Supreme Clan. Who exactly and why? I have no clue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Wild Flame City's Mystic Feather Clan will be the first to suffer! They'll soon find themselves overwhelmed, let alone protecting the Human Community."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Changing the subject, Eugene inquired, "I hear Hannah of the Gellar family from the Mystic Feather Clan visited the slave market today. Did you see her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hannah is quite mysterious; some say she's a cripple, blind and legless, even considering marriage to a Human Community. Others claim she's a prodigious talent, surpassing many elders in the Gellar family. No one has seen her, so who knows what's true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana frowned and shook her head. "I'm sorry, Mr. Eugene Royston, but I didn't see Hannah. She masked herself with some kind of special spell; I couldn't see through it. But one thing's for sure&mdash;she's no cripple."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene looked surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana continued, "Furthermore, she came to the slave market to meet Lachlan. Apparently, the Gellar family intends to marry her off to him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? That's intriguing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugene pondered for a moment before laughing. "If she were a prodigious talent, the Gellar family wouldn't waste her on a lowly human. But she also doesn't seem like a cripple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, well, if she remains unseen, so be it. After all, she's just a young member of the Gellar family. Even if she's not a cripple and is a prodigious talent, it won't change much. Once the Mystic Feather Clan crumbles, the Gellar family and she will suffer the same fate. They won't amount to much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, Eugene furrowed his brow and said, "Ironically, it's that guy from Human Community, Lachlan, who surprised me. I thought he'd be dead by Fabian's hand. It seems he's got talent, though not yet on my radar. Still, we can't allow him to grow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Send someone to keep an eye on him. If the opportunity arises, take him out. He might have access to an ancient god's treasury; it would behoove us to get our hands on it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Eugene exited the slave market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't need to see me off. I'll be atop the floating mountain until Mystic Feather Clan is wiped out. Contact me if anything arises."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, Eugene's figure was shrouded in thick mist, and he shot skyward toward the colossal floating mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana gazed at the floating mountain, and her eyes filled with envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in a building not far from the slave market, Hannah and an elderly man exchanged a glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man chuckled. "That guy managed to survive the crisis on his own, huh? No wonder you took an interest in him. He's indeed different from the others in East Zone Human Community&mdash;crazy, wild."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's face lit up with a smile. "He really surprised me! I thought I'd have to step in and save him, which would've blown my cover. And the consequences of that..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression grew somber as she pondered this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandfather, do you think what I did will implicate Mystic Feather Clan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man's countenance turned grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head. "I can't say for sure. You were too impulsive with that move! You could've provoked Demonic Dragon Clan or Soaring Lion Clan, and it wouldn't have mattered much. After all, Mystic Feather Clan isn't to be trifled with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you went after Paramount Supreme Clan, and not just any member, but one of their prodigies! This could well become a calamity for the Gellar family, a disaster for Mystic Feather Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hannah's face paled at his words.</span></p><div class="pagination">
