  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, I'll go fetch it! I'll have it soon enough," Marvin hastily agreed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne furrowed his brows and murmured, "Isa, are we just going to let him go? He's the patriarch of the Williamson family, an S-class Supreme Overlord warrior. He must have allies of equal standing. What if he rallies them against us?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa smiled, "Wouldn't that be better? We'll just extort each one. I've been searching the seas for a while now, and I'm getting rather bored."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was left speechless.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing her unwavering confidence, Osborne finally ceased his attempts to persuade her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin fled as if his life depended on it.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne took Isa's hand, retrieving a chair from Dimensional Space. They sat down.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Isa, haven't you found the person you're searching for yet?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa shook her head and said, "I can't find her! I don't know where she's hiding, but she should be near Tethynia. Unfortunately, her powers haven't fully awakened yet, so I can't sense her presence.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's not dwell on that. Tell me about your recent adventures."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She turned towards Osborne with a smile that spoke volumes of her affection.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne had no secrets from Isa; he recounted everything that had transpired.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh? Clarissa, the Fatebearer, has broken through to Class AA! Then she's not far from Class AAA! You're already at Class AAA, and once she breaks through, you two can consummate.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Once your body is baptized by her fate power, you'll be able to advance to Class S. You'll finally have some real strength."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Isa had her say, Osborne felt a flush of embarrassment tint his cheeks, prompting him to swiftly steer the conversation towards the next topic at hand.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he mentioned his encounter with Emma, Isa turned icy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She declared, "So that's how it is!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That vixen actually forced herself on you? And she succeeded? She deserves a good punishment! But considering she treated you well and was even willing to give you all the death power she's accumulated over two decades to enhance your perception, I'll forgive her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Otherwise, she'd see what I'm capable of!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne looked astonished.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Death power?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa nodded. "That girl's talent is quite remarkable. She possesses a powerful technique, Death's Stare. She's accumulated death power for over twenty years, and it was activated during your consummation. Death power can transform your mind, enhancing your perception."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I see!" Osborne exclaimed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He suddenly figured out everything.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Emma parted ways with him, she had bestowed all her death power upon him. His mind would gradually change, and his perception grew keener.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It would bolster his confidence for the Honor Quest Ceremony in a little over twenty days.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Isa, in just over twenty days, I'll be hosting the Honor Quest Ceremony at the Augustine Estate in Newport City. Will you attend?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa smiled teasingly, "Should I challenge you?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne froze. If Isa were to challenge him, he doubted he could flawlessly complete the Honor Quest Ceremony.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, Isa was incredibly powerful!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Marvin, an S-class opponent, had barely any chance against her. Even at his peak, Osborne was easily defeated by her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That sounds like a splendid idea," Isa exclaimed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her interest was piqued. "I've decided. I'll attend the Honor Quest Ceremony and challenge you there! If you can overcome all other challengers, I'll face you!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was taken aback by her words.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Isa, stop it! I'm not confident enough to deal with the other challengers. With you added to the mix, how could I possibly stand a chance?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa smiled, "How can there be no chance? I'll help you grow stronger! And when the time comes, I'll restrain my power, using only AAA-class strength to duel with you. You're my man. Don't you have the confidence to defeat me?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you can best me then, I'll let you have your way with me. How does that sound?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her offer was laced with temptation.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne caught the underlying meaning in her words and asked in surprise, "After more than 20 days, you'll be able to control your strength to only use AAA-class power against me? Does that mean you'll already be at Calss S by then?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa nodded. "Of course. I'm confident in that.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, if you want to have sex with me, you'll have to seize this opportunity at the Honor Quest Ceremony! My situation is unique. After I break through to Class S, my strength will grow even faster. It will be even harder for you to catch up to me.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Therefore, you'd better defeat me at the Honor Quest Ceremony, or else how long will I wait for our chance to consummate?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne swallowed hard at her words.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A fierce determination kindled in his eyes. He locked his gaze with hers and declared with unwavering resolve, "Isa! You've said it yourself!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In more than 20 days, at the Honor Quest Ceremony, I will definitely defeat you! When the time comes, I will strip you bare, pin you down on the bed, and bang you!"</p><div class="pagination">
