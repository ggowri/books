  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne handed the Dimensional Bag to Betty, the contents shimmering with immense potential. Inside lay over a million Ultimate Essence Crystals, a hundred Celestial Crystals, and ten Miracle Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could have given more, but after careful consideration, he decided that this was sufficient for Spark of Blaze to flourish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had done enough&mdash;what happened next was no longer his concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't expect Spark of Blaze to become a top-tier force capable of standing against all factions; he just hoped it could protect as many of the East Zone's Human Community as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, when Betty laid eyes on the treasures within the Dimensional Bag, she was utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless Ultimate Essence Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hundred Celestial Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten Miracle Elixirs!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were treasures she had never even dared to dream of. Even the elites from the Paramount Supreme Clans in Celestara might not have access to such resources for their training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine!" Betty exclaimed, gripping the Dimensional Bag tightly, her lips trembling as she looked at Osborne, her eyes brimming with reluctance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would rather forfeit the contents of the bag than see him go. If it hadn't been for Osborne, she and her sisters would have long since been sold into slavery by Fabian, becoming mere objects for his depraved desires.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Osborne who had changed their fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he had rarely been present and never involved himself in the day-to-day affairs of Spark of Blaze, just knowing he was their backing had given them immense comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, with him leaving, they felt a wave of anxiety wash over them, uncertainty clouding their future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, can't you stay?" they pleaded, their expressions filled with desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head gently, a soft smile on his face. "You've all done remarkably well during this time! Even without me, you'll keep Spark of Blaze thriving! Just keep doing what you've been doing. I hope that the next time we meet, you'll all be powerful figures in your own right!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you encounter any insurmountable challenges, reach out to Angelo, the vice commander of the Wild Flame Army. He's one of my people and will help you tackle any issues that come your way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne waved his hand, signaling that it was time to part ways.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! All good things must come to an end, but if fate allows, we'll meet again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He activated the dimensional portal to Hope Haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren and the others quickly stepped inside, ready to embark on their next chapter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once part of an elite group known as the Pioneers of Starlight in the West Zone, they had once stood firm against a million-strong Dark Deity Legion, fighting valiantly until every last one of them had fallen, refusing to surrender even when captured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne had rescued them from the slave market, they had been battered and broken, their divine power essence ravaged. To help them regain their strength, he had transformed them into Blood Clan members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he was bringing them along to merge with the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With over four thousand eight hundred Blood Demon members already in place, adding Darren and his group of five thousand two hundred would bring their numbers to a formidable ten thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Darren and his group were currently at a significant disadvantage compared to the Blood Demon members, they had plenty of Celestial Crystals in Hope Haven to help them rapidly elevate their strength. Their power levels would soon catch up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, Darren and his comrades were true warriors forged in the crucible of battle. They would integrate seamlessly with the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After some time spent training and coordinating, they would blend perfectly into the ranks, greatly enhancing the overall strength of the Blood Demon forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, over five thousand of Darren's crew had entered Hope Haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! I need to be on my way!" Osborne called out, waving goodbye to Betty and her sisters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them stood there, tears welling in their eyes, reluctant to see him go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's hesitation, Osborne pulled out a Supreme Malevolence Airship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here, take this as well!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The East Zone is still a territory controlled by various factions. If I'm right, a full-scale war between them and the Human Community in the West Zone is on the horizon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When that happens, you might find yourselves in danger. If things get too hot in the East Zone, come find me in the West Zone! With this Supreme Malevolence Airship, your journey will be safer and faster!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take care, and until we meet again!" he said, his voice firm yet warm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those parting words, Osborne vanished from the sight of the three sisters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stood there, biting their lips, lost in thought for what felt like an eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, it was Betty who broke the silence with a heavy sigh. "Let's go! No matter what, he will always be the leader of Spark of Blaze! We have to grow and strengthen our organization so we don't disappoint Mr. Augustine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determination shone in each of their eyes, solidifying their resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne hadn't yet left Spark Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He made his way to find Harry and Amelia, the first two people he had encountered upon arriving in Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were deep in their training, completely focused on honing their skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not wanting to disturb them, Osborne quietly placed a Dimensional Bag beside them, which was filled with resources to aid in their growth, before quickly slipping away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's time to head to the West Zone!" he murmured to himself.</span></p><div class="pagination">
