  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Except for Agatha and Angela, no one expected Osborne to actually dare to make the first move.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Osborne suddenly made his move under such circumstances.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His Sacred Power Arrow was incredibly fast. The crowd still had mocking and disdainful smiles on their faces, convinced in their hearts that Osborne was doomed and would be easily defeated by Dexter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne's Sacred Power Arrow had already crossed the void, struck Dexter's defense, and exploded with a roar.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ten Earth Arrows simultaneously hit Dexter's defense and exploded, unleashing unimaginable power. After all, Osborne had recently used arrows to kill more than a dozen mid Empyrean Sacredness Space Pirates.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though Dexter was an advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior, he couldn't withstand the ten-arrow attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't even have time to react; his defense was shattered, and the terrifying force tore through his skin and flesh, crushing his bones and soul.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the violent explosion ended, Dexter had vanished from the spot, leaving only fragments of his corpse on the ground, still emanating intense Sacred Power fluctuations.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A branch emerged from the void and swept away all the large chunks of flesh and remains.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's the Warfare Ancient Tree again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the Warfare Ancient Tree and Osborne were already working in perfect harmony&mdash;Osborne handled the killing, while the Warfare Ancient Tree swept away the remains to use as its nourishment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was deathly silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those who had been mocking Osborne earlier now froze, staring in disbelief at the spot where Dexter vanished, nervously swallowing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was an advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the surrounding Stellar Regions, an advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior could easily become the leader of a regular Second-rate Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, was he killed by ten arrows from Osborne, who isn't even an Empyrean Sacredness warrior?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their eyes were filled with fear, looking at Osborne as if he were a monster.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He definitely isn't an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He must have hidden his cultivation level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone thought so.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the people of Cobalt Island finally recovered from their shock. Seeing their Elder killed by Osborne, cold killing intent filled their eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You dare to kill a Cobalt Island Elder!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone from Cobalt Island, listen up! Go all out and take down all three of them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the command given, the people of Cobalt Island immediately took action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The remaining five advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors charged toward Osborne and the other two at lightning speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Leave Cobalt Island's Vice Island Master to me!" Angela shouted sharply, instantly drawing her Sacred Artifact and taking the initiative to confront.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This one's mine!" Agatha also locked onto an advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior and charged without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Flash let out an earth-shattering roar and lunged forward, swiftly knocking a Cobalt Island advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior flying. Its sharp claws tore through the opponent's defense, almost ripping them in half.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne praised, "Flash is amazing! But I can't lose to him either!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne set his sights on the last two advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors, along with the group of mid Empyrean Sacredness and primary Empyrean Sacredness warriors behind them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He swiftly drew the Bloodwrought Bow, and a radiant arrow appeared on the bowstring.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Solar Sacred Arrow, Earth Arrow, Thousand Arrows Release," Osborne murmured softly. He instantly released the bowstring, and the Sacred Power Arrow shot out. The moment it left the string, it began to split&mdash;one into ten, ten into a hundred, a hundred into a thousand...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the blink of an eye, countless arrows filled the void, almost blotting out the sky.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is the second form of Solar Sacred Arrow, Arrow Storm, the strongest attack of Earth Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the blink of an eye, one arrow had split into ten thousand, overwhelming the sky as they shot toward the enemy, with most targeting the two advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the two looked at the terrifying Sacred Power Arrows filling the sky, utterly terrified.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They wanted to retreat, wanted to dodge, but found it completely impossible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's Sacred Power Arrows were too fast. After splitting, they immediately entered the void for interdimensional travel, appearing around them almost like teleportation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, ten thousand arrows exploded simultaneously, obliterating everything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Earth Arrow's ultimate move, Arrow Storm. Osborne had no idea how effective it would be against two advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors and dozens of mid and primary Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This move was already his second strongest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And soon, he knew the result.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The power of Arrow Storm was even greater than Osborne had imagined. In that instant, no matter what methods or defenses the locked-on enemies used, none of them could withstand Arrow Storm. They were all shattered and utterly killed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's attack instantly cleared the entire void in front of him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All his enemies vanished without a trace, leaving only shattered remains of bodies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Too tragic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the terrifying power was rampaging wildly, causing the entire resource-bearing planet to shake violently, as if it were about to crack open. Fortunately, it was a medium-sized resource-bearing planet, large enough to withstand it. If it had been a micro planet or even a small resource-bearing planet, the entire planet would have exploded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the spectators were all stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne ignored them and looked at Flash. At this moment, Flash had also swiftly killed his opponent. Flash could face Magma Devourers head-on, and even against Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warriors, he could hold his ground for a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mere advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors couldn't withstand a few moves from him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He even felt unsatisfied at this moment and was already rushing toward Agatha, intending to snatch Agatha's opponent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha's opponent was also an advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Agatha were willing to unleash the power of the Dark Phoenix, she could handle ordinary advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors. However, at this moment, she clearly didn't want to do so, making the battle somewhat challenging.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even so, she was already remarkable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Agatha had just recently broken through to primary Empyrean Sacredness, with a gap of two cultivation levels from her opponent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Flash's arrival, everything became easier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha's opponent was dismembered by Flash and Agatha together.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, it was Angela's battlefield.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela was the highest in cultivation level among the three, having reached mid Empyrean Sacredness. However, her opponent was also the strongest, the vice island master of Cobalt Island, whose strength surpassed that of a typical advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But by the time Flash arrived, Angela had just killed her opponent with a single sword strike.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Flash immediately showed a disappointed expression, glared at Angela, and seemed a bit displeased.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obviously, Flash still wanted to keep fighting.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela felt puzzled. She had defeated the opponent alone, so why was Flash still dissatisfied?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Flash, come back!" With the battle over, Osborne called Flash back to prevent him from offending Angela.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela was strong, but she definitely wasn't a match for Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the three gathered together. Thanks to Osborne's outburst, the battle remained incredibly easy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne glanced into the distance, ignoring the stunned Azael and the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Let's fix the Cosmic Translocator first. Oh, and don't forget to collect the spoils from those on Cobalt Island."</span></p><div class="pagination">
