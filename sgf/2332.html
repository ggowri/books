  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Osborne had pulled off some amazing stunts, Angela just couldn't shake the gloomy feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since the state duel kicked off, everyone knew there were four super geniuses in the mix&mdash;Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them had fused three types of Sacred Power, putting them in a league of their own compared to the rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had managed to beat Conrad and Lincoln. But Angela was watching the whole thing from afar via projections. She had no idea that Osborne had also fused three powers, so she didn't hold out much hope for his fight against Benson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she wasn't alone; her thoughts were pretty much in line with what the other onlookers were thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson going up against Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a no-brainer. Everyone knew it was gonna be a total mismatch. Apart from Broderick, Horace, and Agatha, no one could hold a candle to Benson. They'd be flattened like a pancake in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as the fight got underway, the folks in Frost Peak City were left gobsmacked. They stared in disbelief as Osborne and Benson went at it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me Benson's not really trying, right? Or maybe he got his butt kicked when he fought Agatha?" one spectator gasped, eyes as big as saucers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why the hell hasn't Benson wrapped this up yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How the heck is Osborne blocking all of Benson's attacks? What's the deal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I seeing things, or is Osborne actually giving Benson a run for his money? I must be dreaming, but it looks like Osborne's getting the upper hand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others joined in, each one more flabbergasted than the last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela was in the same boat. She gawked at the projection, completely gobsmacked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that Osborne was holding his own against Benson was like a bombshell in Frost Peak City. It wouldn't be long before the news spread like wildfire across the entire Zephyr State.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Could it be that Osborne might actually pull off a win?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Wow, I really sold him short!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let loose arrow after arrow at Benson. Benson gritted his teeth and fought back with redoubled determination, but against Osborne's Satan's Eye, every move was as clear as day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could spot the weak spots in Benson's attacks. If he'd wanted to, he could have taken Benson down with a whole lot less effort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he chose to go head-to-head with Benson, aiming to probe Benson's limits. At the same time, it was also a test of his own mastery of power. If he shot an arrow and shattered Benson's attack, yet the Sacred Power arrow remained intact, it meant he had overused his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conversely, if the Sacred Power arrow dissipated but Benson's attack remained unbroken, it meant he had used too little power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As it turned out, Osborne had now reached a remarkable level of power control. Every time, he could precisely shatter Benson's attacks without wasting an iota of Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle raged on for a solid five minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne figured it was about time to wrap things up. Benson's face had turned as pale as a sheet, his Sacred Power was running on empty, and his strength was starting to wane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Benson charged forward, fueled by an unwillingness to accept defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne made up his mind to end this fight, as he noticed that Broderick was fast approaching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's finish this," Osborne declared, not increasing the power of his next arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, it was slightly weaker, but its trajectory had shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Satan's Eye guiding him, Osborne had pinpointed Benson's vulnerabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This arrow was aimed right at Benson's weak spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, the Sacred Power arrow effortlessly shattered Benson's defenses and pierced through his shoulder, sending him crashing back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson sprayed blood on the ground, a look of bewilderment in his eyes as he lay there, staring blankly upwards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had lost!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a grueling five minutes, he faced defeat&mdash;not just in terms of losing, but in the profound despair he'd felt during the confrontation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't merely regret; it was a crushing sense of hopelessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he realized this defeat felt more like a release than a despairing loss, far worse than his earlier defeat against Agatha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're toast!" Osborne's voice rang out through the stillness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson stirred a bit and slowly sat up. His eyes locked onto Osborne, a maelstrom of emotions swirling in his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long beat, he yanked off his chest badge and chucked it at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm beat! I throw in the towel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wince, he continued, "So Agatha was talking about you, huh? She tracked us down and took us out because she decided we weren't worth her time anymore, all thanks to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne arched an eyebrow. "Did Agatha really say that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson nodded with a wry smile on his face. "It's a real kick in the teeth. Before the state duel started, I thought I was untouchable, that I could take on anyone. And here I am, getting my butt kicked twice in a row... what a humiliation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One at the hands of Agatha and the other, a grueling contest against Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Benson's eyes, Agatha still emerged as the stronger fighter. However, he had to admit that if anyone had a shot at challenging her, it might just be Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, even Horace had bitten the dust. Agatha's score was creeping close to 11 million. At this point, the only one who could still pose a threat to Agatha was Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned forward, eyes blazing with determination. "Osborne, do me a favor. Help us take down Agatha!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The state duel champion can't end up being a woman! We can't let a woman stand above all us men!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but laugh at that sentiment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Clara and Leroy shot him angry looks. "What's wrong with women? Why can't a woman win the championship? Your thinking is pretty outdated! Isn't it funny that you, a disciple of the Resurgent Throne Palace, are rooting for Osborne instead of Agatha winning?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson merely sighed, not bothering to defend himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a new figure emerged from the distance, bringing with him an aura of threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Broderick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he spotted Benson sprawled on the ground and Osborne clutching his chest badge, Broderick came to a sudden halt, his face etched with utter disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Broderick asked with a frown, "Benson, what in the world is going on here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson managed to pull himself up and shot a quick look at Broderick. "Look for yourself. I got clobbered. I lost to Osborne! You're just in the nick of time 'cause I've got a sneaking suspicion you're the next one up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Broderick's eyes nearly popped out in shock. "You lost? One-on-one? Or was it a three-on-one situation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There had to be multiple opponents ganging up on Benson for him to lose; that was the only thing that added up. After all, Broderick reckoned he was a smidge stronger than Benson, but it was a close call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew he couldn't bank on winning a one-on-one bout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Benson had been defeated by three opponents ganging up on him, Broderick thought he might have a shot at taking them on one by one and emerging victorious in the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But alas, Benson's next words blew his hopes sky-high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One-on-one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Broderick let out a deep breath and sized Osborne up. His expression was grim because he knew that Benson wouldn't pull the wool over his eyes on this matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So, Osborne's better than Benson?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a bitter pill to swallow, but instead of backing off like a coward, Broderick's fighting spirit went through the roof.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's do this! Just because you took down Benson doesn't mean you can take me out! If you wanna prove yourself to me, you gotta fight me straight up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Broderick charged forward, itching for a scrap.</span></p><div class="pagination">
