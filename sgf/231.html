  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the power emanating from Clarissa reached its zenith. With a deafening crack, the statue shattered into countless pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa kept her eyes closed as the immense black-and-white wings enveloped her completely, hinting at a wondrous transformation taking place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This change lasted a full five minutes before it began to settle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the wings unfurled, Clarissa opened her eyes, a fierce glint flashing from them, only to soften soon after, mingled with confusion and awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart raced with anxiety as he couldn't help but ask, "Clarissa, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa met his gaze and broke into a smile. "Osborne, I'm fine! I feel... incredible&mdash;like never before! I think my power level has shot up to Class B+!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, her eyes instinctively shifted to the magnificent wings spread behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Divine and Demonic Wings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Divine and Demonic Wings?" Osborne echoed, utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could hardly wrap his mind around her newly acquired Class B+ status. He was still stuck in Class C+ and had no idea how to even approach Class B!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa added, "It's strange; I feel like my mind has suddenly opened up with knowledge. These wings&mdash;they're my power, a dual-edged sword for both offense and defense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a mere thought, Clarissa flicked her wings with a force that resonated like deadly blades across the void in front of her. Instantly, two massive dimensional rifts erupted, slicing the very fabric of space apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's jaw dropped in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Those wings can tear space asunder? That's insane! The destructive potential of the attack could probably take down even a Class A martial master! Even with my level three Devil's Light, I'd stand no chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gasped in awe, taking a step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa, equally astonished, realized that she had merely scratched the surface of her new powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She concentrated, and the wings wrapped around her, creating an impenetrable barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, go ahead and give it a shot. Attack me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated but eventually nodded. "Alright, but be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His curiosity was piqued; he had to see just how formidable this defense was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne threw a punch at the wings, using only a fraction of his strength, cautious not to hurt her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it looked like he had underestimated the wings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His </span><span>fist</span><span> met an unyielding force as though he was striking an impenetrable wall. The recoil sent a shockwave through his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh? Try again!" Clarissa urged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Osborne poured more strength into his punch. The result was the same&mdash;only a resolute, impenetrable surface met him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that I have to use my power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth and summoned his level three Devil's Light, focusing all his energy into his fist before launching another strike at her wings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the energy collided with the wings, they finally responded, rippling with a violent energy that shook the space around them. Yet the wings did not shatter; they remained whole, absorbing the impact before sending an overwhelming wave of force back towards Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wincing from the reverberation, he staggered back a step. "There's no way I'm giving up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, brace yourself!" Osborne shouted, revving up to unleash a full eighty percent of his Devil's Light power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, the wings trembled fiercely; their edges frayed ever so slightly, hinting at imminent collapse. But somehow, they held firm, pushing back against the onslaught, leaving Osborne breathless, his face going pale as he stumbled back a couple more steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unbelievable!" Osborne muttered, astonished at the resilience and force of those Divine and Demonic Wings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared, wide-eyed, at Clarissa's Divine and Demonic Wings. The sheer defensive power of these wings was staggering. He had expended nearly all of his strength except for his transformation into a Vampire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Class B+ Orion wouldn't have remained unscathed under such an onslaught, yet Clarissa had effortlessly withstood it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had a sinking feeling that even if he transformed into a vampire and unleashed the full might of his level three Devil's Light, he might still struggle to breach the protection of the Divine and Demonic Wings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This power is incredible!" Osborne exclaimed, astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa, visibly pleased, retracted her wings and looked at Osborne with concern. "Osborne, are you okay? My Divine and Demonic Wings don't just provide defense&mdash;they also reflect half of the attacking force back at the enemy. I just learned that myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head with a smile. "I'm fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he felt a deep sense of joy for Clarissa. He had always known she was special, possessing three powers as a true child of destiny. But previously, her powers were weak, lacking both offensive and defensive capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Clarissa had filled in all the gaps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was all thanks to that statue&mdash;the Sacred Sorceress!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wondered, "What's the connection between the statue and Clarissa? Why did I touch the statue and nothing happened, yet Clarissa undergoes such a transformation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, the statue had shattered completely. To learn more about it, he'd have to consult the Lark family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced at the scattered pieces of the statue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then his expression shifted in surprise. "Wait! There's something in the fragments!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
