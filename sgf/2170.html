  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the voice faded, a tall figure materialized before Tyrese and his companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight of Maddox, a wave of relief washed over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The panic and fear that had gripped their faces melted away, replaced by a newfound confidence and arrogance. They quickly bowed to the imposing man, their expressions filled with deep respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Maddox Corenswet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox waved his hand dismissively, then turned his gaze toward Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa scrutinized him in return. Maddox wore a wolfskin hat, which was crafted from an entire wolf's head, its jagged teeth still intact, giving him a menacing appearance that shimmered with an eerie blue glow, crackling with energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an Apex divine artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hat lent Maddox a wild, feral air, as if he were a fierce giant wolf ready to pounce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Isa showed no sign of fear; her expression remained calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gazing steadily at Maddox, she said in a calm voice, "You're the real ally the Lord Malevolence has recruited?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox looked at her, a glint of greed and desire flashing in his eyes. "Yeah! I'm Maddox Corenswet, a seventh-ranked inner disciple of the Mystic Sirius Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And I have to say, you're quite the catch&mdash;both in looks and power. How about you ditch the God of Night and become mine instead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa chuckled, her demeanor unshaken, "If you want to fight, then let's get on with it. Why humiliate yourself? Do you really think after I wipe the floor with you, your power will magically increase?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox's face darkened, fury replacing his earlier arrogance. "You clearly don't know your place!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that's how you want to play it, don't expect me to go easy on you when the time comes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa raised an eyebrow, a hint of amusement in her voice. "Do you even have the strength to show mercy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox laughed, a brash, mocking sound. "You think defeating Ricky makes you some kind of big deal?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In my presence, you'll barely make a splash! Take my advice&mdash;surrender now, and I might let you walk away in one piece."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa remained unfazed, her tone steady. "And I suggest you take your Mystic Sirius friends and get lost from Celestara Planet. I can spare your lives if you do. Otherwise, this place will become your grave, and you'll find yourselves... dying far from home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox laughed again, his demeanor growing increasingly wild and arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you think you can kill me, then bring it on! You want me to leave? Keep dreaming! Zayne invited me here, and I'm not about to back down from helping him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He'll deal with the God of Night, and I will take care of you pesky little fish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa replied coolly, "Is that so? Then you better watch out; you might just find these 'little fish' devouring you down to the bone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox said, "Let's see you try!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bring it on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Maddox and Isa locked eyes, the tension between them palpable, each radiating fierce determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Ricky crawled out of the crater, his gaze filled with venom as he glared at Isa. Although he lacked the courage to speak, he turned to the God of Time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Maddox Corenswet, you deal with this woman. We'll handle the rest!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox nodded, unfazed by Ricky's request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Ricky charged forward, unleashing all his pent-up fury, intent on directing it at the God of Time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Time gritted her teeth, struggling to fend off the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she was no match for the furious Ricky and his six companions; in an instant, she found herself on the defensive, overwhelmed by their combined might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the situation unfold, Maddox sneered at Isa, saying, "Looks like she's about to go down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa simply smiled, her calm demeanor unwavering. "Not necessarily! Girls, show time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, three stunning figures shot out from the Sanctum of Night, racing toward the God of Time in an instant, launching a fierce assault on Ricky, Tyrese, and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Ricky and his six companions were sent flying, all but Ricky&mdash;an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King&mdash;who barely managed to stabilize himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other six were thrown back, blood spilling from their mouths as they crashed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricky stared in disbelief at the three beautiful figures that had suddenly appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell are you?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm Clarissa Radcliffe!" one of them replied, her voice steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief pause, she added, "You can also call me the Goddess of Fate! I've returned from the cycle of reincarnation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words hung in the air, and an eerie silence fell around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Human Alliance were stunned, then erupted into loud cheers and jubilant shouts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's the Goddess of Fate from the Seven Great Deity Kings of the Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Goddess of Fate has come back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's returned since the God of Time's reincarnation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our Human Community is saved!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, countless warriors from the Human Alliance felt tears streaming down their faces, their eyes glistening with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were veterans who had lived through the great battle a thousand years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, the Human Community had faced its darkest hour, and it was the Seven Great Deity Kings who had stepped up to protect them from Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had paid a heavy price, with only the God of Night and the God of Light surviving, while the other five had fallen, sacrificing their lives for the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A countless number of souls were plunged into the abyss of sorrow by their demise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with the God of Time back and the Goddess of Fate returned, how could they not be overjoyed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the surprises didn't stop there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma spoke up calmly, "I'm Emma Augustine, but you can also call me the God of Death! I've come back from the cycle of reincarnation as well!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm Austin Montague, and you can call me the Goddess of Life. I've returned from the cycle of reincarnation too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, the crowd fell into stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a wave of ecstatic cheers erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my God! It's the God of Death and the Goddess of Life! They've all returned!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bless the Human Community! Bless the Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're back! They're really back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears flowed freely as the warriors of the Human Alliance felt their hearts swell with pride and hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heroes who had once protected them&mdash;the God of Time, the Goddess of Life, the God of Death, and the Goddess of Fate&mdash;had all returned from the cycle of reincarnation, restored to their former glory, ready to stand on the front lines once more to protect Celestara Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst the excitement, the most shocked of all was the God of Time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at Clarissa, Emma, and Austin, her face a mask of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you... No! This can't be! How can you be their reincarnation? It's impossible! This can't be happening!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Time's expression twisted with horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The reincarnation of the Goddess of Fate?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The God of Death?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Goddess of Life?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How is this possible?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Clarissa, Emma, and Austin&mdash;how could they be part of the Seven Great Deity Kings?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">They were all connected to Osborne... why?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why do they share this connection?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a bold and audacious thought flickered in the God of Time's mind, but she quickly shook her head, dismissing it vehemently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! This can't be! I refuse to believe it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's absolutely impossible!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
