  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After watching Osborne leave, Angela stared at Adriana, her face a picture of confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She seemed to have something on the tip of her tongue, but every time she was about to speak, she held back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana gave her a smile. "Come on, what's bothering you? Just say it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela finally found her voice. "Ms. Alba, why did you mislead Osborne? Merging four powers at the Supernal Deity King Level? That's almost unheard of. Merging three powers is already a once-in-a-blue-moon feat, the mark of a real prodigy. Even you only managed to merge three powers ahead of time back then, right? You tried for a fourth but didn't succeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the whole Glorious Divine Kingdom, even across the entire Racial Convergence Planet, no one has ever pulled off merging four powers ahead of schedule. And even among the Empyrean Sacredness warriors, only a handful can do it. Aren't you just piling on the pressure by telling him that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela was left scratching her head in bewilderment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana let out a soft laugh. "Is a little pressure such a bad thing? And who said no one can merge four powers ahead of time? Out there in the vast expanse of the universe, there are plenty of folks who can!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For Isa this time, my expectation is that she should forcibly merge at least three powers, and it'd be even better if she can manage four. Only by achieving this can she stand a chance against the geniuses from those genuine Apex Clans when she ventures into the core regions of the universe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela was so stunned that her jaw nearly dropped to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that really doable? Even though Isa is a Celestial Progeny, attempting to merge four powers ahead of schedule is an incredibly tall order, isn't it? I still firmly believe it's just out of the question."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana replied calmly, "Is it impossible? That's exactly what sets a Celestial Progeny apart&mdash;transforming the seemingly impossible into reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As her teacher, I have to set the bar as high as possible. Otherwise, it would be a huge waste of her exceptional talent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela let out a long sigh. "Fine! You're always right. Isa, being a Celestial Progeny, might actually pull it off. But Osborne isn't. Telling him that might just demoralize him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana flashed a smile. "Get discouraged? Not him! A real powerhouse doesn't get disheartened just because others are more powerful. Instead, they'll roll up their sleeves and work even harder to catch up. I have full confidence in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think I invited him back to the Fairy Moon Sect just because of your recommendation? If I hadn't seen the spark of true greatness in him, I wouldn't have even shown my face."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she gazed off into the distance. "It's a shame he's not destined to be part of the Fairy Moon Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's carrying so many burdens on his shoulders that there's not much I can do to help him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana gave a little shake of her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, anyway, since I've given him some guidance this time, he should at least remember my kindness. If the Fairy Moon Sect ever runs into trouble in the future, I hope he won't just stand by and watch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela's eyes nearly popped out of her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is Ms. Alba suggesting that the Fairy Moon Sect might need Osborne's help someday? That was unthinkable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Fairy Moon Sect? In trouble? It is the mightiest First-rate Power in the Glorious Divine Kingdom. Who on earth could pose a threat to it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And even if it does face a problem it can't handle, what can Osborne possibly do about it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela shook her head but kept her lips sealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She simply fixed her eyes on Adriana and asked, "Ms. Alba, will you take part in the upcoming Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana paused for a moment, then shook her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't be in it. But the Glorious Divine Kingdom has informed me that after the duel, they want me to join a major event. All the leaders of First-rate Powers in the kingdom are required to attend!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Glorious Divine Kingdom is up to something big this time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela's expression hardened in an instant. "The Glorious Divine Kingdom is planning something major? What on earth are they up to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana shook her head. "Don't fret about things that don't concern you. Just focus on your training mission at the Mystic Sirius Sect. By the way, have you found any clues about the alleged slave-trading business of the Mystic Sirius Sect?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela shook her head again. "Ms. Alba, could the intelligence be off the mark? I've been at the Mystic Sirius Sect for over thirty years, and I've yet to find any proof of their involvement in slave trading."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana furrowed her brows. "Let's hope that's the case. But my source is reliable. If they said it, there's probably some truth to it. The Mystic Sirius Sect might be in the wrong. Keep looking into it, but make sure you don't blow your cover."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it, Ms. Alba!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana said, "Good. I'm off. If Osborne makes a splash in the state duel and gets the green light for the zone one, let me know. I'll set aside some time to watch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure thing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Adriana took her leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne had made his way back to his quarters. He wasted no time activating the time-acceleration function and went into seclusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adriana's words had been like a light bulb going off in his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at the same time, the things she'd said later had piled on the pressure for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were people out there who could merge three, or even four, powers ahead of schedule at the Supernal Deity King Level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was well aware of how tough it was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if others could pull it off, Osborne was convinced he could, too. If he couldn't, it just meant he wasn't cutting it and there was still plenty of room to step up his game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Others can merge three or four powers ahead of schedule. Well, then I've got to merge at least four! And since I'm fully merged with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, I should be able to handle even more. So, my aim is to merge five powers ahead of time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Or maybe even more!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a fierce glint of determination in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">For now, I'll start by merging the third energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne promptly began sizing up his options for the next power to merge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd already combined the dark and spatial powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne also had other choices like thunder power, divine power, physical power, soul power, or time power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All in all, there were seven powers on the table!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, these seven were the more potent powers Osborne had under his belt, the ones that were really worth merging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he didn't worry about how strong they were, he also had metal, water, fire, earth, and wind elemental powers, light power, and mind-control power at his disposal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These powers could also be part of the merging process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne had neglected these powers for ages and hadn't put any real effort into cultivating them. Even if he merged them, they wouldn't give him much of an edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Once I've merged the powers I've been focusing on, then I'll think about these. Even though the boost won't be huge, at that high-level stage, every little bit of improvement can help me outshine a bunch of opponents. It's all about that extra step forward!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and zeroed in on his next merging target&mdash;thunder power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd been concentrating on three powers&mdash;dark, spatial, and thunder powers. Since the dark and spatial powers were already merged, adding thunder power next would be a piece of cake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they all fell into the same elemental power category.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Merging divine power, physical power, or soul power would obviously be a lot trickier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And time power, which came from Satan's Eye, was a whole different ballgame compared to dark, spatial, and thunder power. Merging it would also be a real uphill battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Alright, thunder power it is!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Next, I'll tap into my own understanding and forcefully integrate thunder power into my Sacred Power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If Leroy can pull it off, and Clara can manage it, and most of the top disciples from First-rate Powers can do it, then I, Osborne, sure as hell can too!</span></p><div class="pagination">
