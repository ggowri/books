  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, Clara, and Leroy advancing to the top ten as super dark horses has already become a fact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Royal Family members gritted their teeth in hatred toward the three, but they couldn't annul their results. After all, with so many watching, they didn't want to face further condemnation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What they're considering now is how to prevent all three from making it into the top five!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the solution, of course, is rigging the draw.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Arrange the opponents most likely to defeat them, keeping all three out of the top five. This way, although the Royal Family would still lose face, it wouldn't be too humiliating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista had already shared her idea with Zorro.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The battle on the arena was still ongoing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps Osborne and the others advancing to the top ten gave the other ordinary contestants confidence. In the following battles, every ordinary contestant hoped to defeat a prince or princess like Osborne and the others, advancing to the top ten and making their names known throughout the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But unfortunately, if dark horses appeared frequently, they wouldn't be called dark horses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Advancing ultimately depends on strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their misfortune lay in encountering furious princes and princesses from the Royal Family, leading to even worse outcomes for them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every prince and princess who fought gave their all, showing no intention of sparing any other contestants.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One by one, the contestants were swiftly defeated by the princes and princesses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most were even defeated in a single move!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was only then that everyone realized Yvonne and Yunus were defeated and eliminated not because they were weak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was because Osborne and the others were too strong!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The princes and princesses were incredibly powerful, far beyond what ordinary contestants could match.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Almost every prince could perfectly wield and control the Legendary Sacred Artifact. This alone left ordinary contestants far behind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Prince Matthew wins and advances to the top ten!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the last contestant, Emiliano, also easily defeated his opponent with just one move, the competition to advance from the top twenty to the top ten finally came to an end.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the top ten, aside from Osborne, Clara, and Leroy, all the others were princes and princesses from the Royal Family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zorro announced, "Top ten contestants, step onto the stage for the next round of drawing lots!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne and the others stepped onto the stage, immediately feeling the cold stares from the other seven princes and princesses. Their gazes were filled with malice.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne appeared calm, as if he didn't notice.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy seemed a bit nervous. After all, these princes and princesses held such high status. They naturally exuded a powerful aura, putting immense pressure on Clara and Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Matthew sneered, "You three better pray not to draw me! Otherwise, I'll defeat you with ease! Even though you beat Yunus and Yvonne, that means nothing! The gap between them and me is huge!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Matthew looked arrogant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He ranked third on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, so he indeed had the right to claim his strength surpassed Yunus and Yvonne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Emiliano, ranked second on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, sneered, "Super dark horses? Reaching this point is already your limit! The top five is not a place for people like you! If you face me, I suggest you surrender directly to avoid being humiliated by me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he also looked arrogantly at Osborne and the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There's no need for you to step in! I'll handle it myself! If the three of them face me, I'll defeat them all!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Sean, ranked sixth on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, also sneered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at them and replied coldly, "You&rsquo;re good at bragging. Yunus initially said he&rsquo;d defeat me to restore the Royal Family&rsquo;s lost face and dignity. And what happened? He couldn&rsquo;t even withstand a single arrow from me. All he does is boast about himself."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I think you're all the same! You better pray you don't draw me! Otherwise, your fate will be just like his."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, the princes and princesses were instantly furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kid, you're asking for it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're too arrogant!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered at them, completely unafraid.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Seraphina, ranked first in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, snorted coldly and stared icily at Osborne, "Osborne? You're arrogant, but you do have the right to be! After all, you defeated Yunus. Your strength is already on the same level as most of us here!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But do you think that makes you impressive?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina looked very arrogant. "You'd better pray not to draw me in the lot! Otherwise, I'll show you the true terror of the Royal Family! I'll personally break your legs!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Seraphina finished speaking, the others all looked at Osborne mockingly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression turned cold as well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stared at Seraphina and replied coldly, "You want to break my legs? Originally, I only planned to break one of yours! But since you said that, I&rsquo;ll have to do the same and break both of yours!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Forget the draw."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne suddenly turned around and looked at Zorro. He calmly said, "Can I apply to fight Princess Seraphina directly?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, a sharp gleam flashed in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina was stunned and thought, "What is Osborne doing? He actually doesn't want the draw? He wants to apply directly to fight me? Does he look down on my strength?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Seraphina became furious and said to Zorro, "I also apply to fight Osborne! Let me personally deal with him and break his legs!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zorro was extremely shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't dare to make a decision on his own, so he could only look toward Callista on the viewing platform.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista was also very surprised at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista thought, "Osborne directly applied to fight Princess Seraphina? What is he doing? Is it because he knows he can't make it into the top five no matter what, so he simply chose the strongest?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She frowned slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's challenge to Seraphina disrupted her plan. After hesitating for a moment, she still felt it was safest to stick to the plan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Zorro calmly said, "No! This is the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel. There are rules! This is not a place for your private duels! If you want to fight, either draw lots to face each other or both make it into the top five, and you'll naturally meet then!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, the draw officially begins!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt regretful. He really wanted to fight Seraphina now, so he could block her from entering the top five.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Royal Family members at that time would definitely be even more shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, even if he was refused, he didn&rsquo;t mind. Sooner or later, he would face Seraphina, and then he could break her legs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're very lucky!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina stared at Osborne and sneered, "You must know your request won't be approved, so you're doing this on purpose, right? You better not draw me! Or you'd better not make it into the top five."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Otherwise, I will definitely break your legs!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Seraphina stepped forward to draw a lot.</span></p><div class="pagination">
