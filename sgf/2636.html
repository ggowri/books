  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was extremely excited at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He already had the Bloodwrought Bow, and its compatibility with him had reached an extremely high level, almost like it was a part of his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if given a Supreme Sacred Artifact bow, Osborne would absolutely not trade it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the Apocalypse Bow is different!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Apocalypse Bow is hailed as the strongest bow in the cosmos, once a Sovereign Artifact. Even though it now only has the power of an Imperial Artifact, it is far stronger than the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Bloodwrought Bow might one day rely on the nurturing of the Warfare Ancient Tree to become an Imperial Artifact, but no one knows how long that will take.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne can obtain an Imperial Artifact now and master it, his strength will rapidly increase.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not to mention facing ordinary warriors at the Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness level, Osborne is confident he can even battle a Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Apocalypse Bow, I must have it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I get the Apocalypse Bow, I'll leave the Bloodwrought Bow on Celestara Planet... Just right for Primordial to help me build an altar with the Bloodwrought Bow. That way, even if I venture deeper into the universe, I can channel power back through the Bloodwrought Bow to help my family and friends grow stronger!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking this way, Osborne became even more excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as I pass the twenty-seventh level's trial, I can obtain the Apocalypse Bow..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes were filled with fighting spirit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, his most important task now is to exchange the battle points for the resources and treasures he needs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne wasn't sure if he could clear the twenty-seventh level and had no absolute confidence. If he didn't spend the battle points here and ultimately failed to pass the twenty-seventh level, the battle points would be completely wasted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, spending the battle points now is the safest choice.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I want to exchange battle points!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, "I'll exchange for three drops of Perfect Dragon Elixir first!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The reason his strength was so formidable was largely due to the Perfect Dragon Elixir. Naturally, Osborne wanted to try it again. Although he wasn&rsquo;t sure if the second use of the Perfect Dragon Elixir would be as effective, even if it didn&rsquo;t work, he could give the Perfect Dragon Elixir to Isa, Clarissa, or Anastasia to help them improve their strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So Osborne directly exchanged for three drops of Perfect Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each drop of Perfect Dragon Elixir costs one billion battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's battle points instantly dwindled, leaving only 33.33 million.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These battle points could still be exchanged for three high-quality Supreme Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne no longer cared for Supreme Sacred Artifacts now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if he exchanged for Supreme Sacred Artifacts, they wouldn't enhance his current strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What should I exchange for then?" Osborne pondered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he somewhat missed Primordial. If Primordial were here, he could ask Primordial about what treasures in the cosmos could enhance his strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, after entering the Celestial Spire, Primordial seemed to have fallen into a deep slumber. No matter how he called, he couldn't reach Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only Primordial, but the Warfare Ancient Tree also seemed to have fallen asleep.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the Drum of Empress Kira hidden in his heart, Osborne could no longer sense it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't reach the Drum either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could only assume it was because the Celestial Spire was too miraculous and its power too overwhelming.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He tried asking Toby what treasures he could exchange to boost his strength, but Toby refused to answer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby said, "You can only exchange for treasures you can think of!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You can't exchange for things you can't think of..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had no choice but to leave the 33 million battle points unused in the end.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "After I clear the 27th floor, I can still exchange... Then I'll decide whether to exchange for an Imperial Artifact or something else!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if I can't clear the 27th floor, I don't care about wasting 33 million battle points!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Anyway, I've already exchanged for three drops of Perfect Dragon Elixir and obtained the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear, this Imperial Artifact. I've already profited!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne finally finished the exchange.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The red glow around him disappeared. Meanwhile, Clara, Leroy, and Casey were still in the middle of their exchange.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, they also finished their exchange.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their faces were full of joy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at their now empty battle points above their heads and asked with a smile, "What did you exchange for?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I took your advice and exchanged for three drops of Perfect Dragon Elixir! Besides that, I also got two extremely powerful Supreme Sacred Artifacts!" Leroy said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara nodded and said, "Same here, I really didn't know what to exchange for. Toby refused to give us any hints. Since our battle points weren't enough for an Imperial Artifact, we could only get three drops of Perfect Dragon Elixir and some Supreme Sacred Artifacts."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Casey nodded excitedly. "Same here! I don't know exactly how effective the Perfect Dragon Elixir is, but since it's Osborne's recommendation, it must be great!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides, I also exchanged for some Legendary Dragon Elixir!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "Not bad! You won't regret it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, he saw them huddled together, discussing something.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, they walked over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara took out a jadeflare vial and said to Osborne, "Osborne, there are three drops of Perfect Dragon Elixir in here! These are our gift to thank you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Toby said each person can only take two drops of Perfect Dragon Elixir, and taking more would have no effect. So we each kept two drops of Perfect Dragon Elixir. These three drops are for you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, don't refuse just yet. If it weren't for you leading us, we wouldn't have been able to come here at all, nor could we have earned so many battle points to exchange for such great items..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We have no way to repay you, we just want to do something for you, and we hope you can accept it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, they all looked at Osborne sincerely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't know that each person could only take two drops of Perfect Dragon Elixir, nor did he ask Toby.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the sincere gazes of the women, Osborne hesitated for a moment but eventually nodded. "Alright, I'll accept it then!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't refuse because the Perfect Dragon Elixir was indeed useful to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had already used one drop before and could use one more at most, but Isa, Clarissa, Anastasia, Emma, and others still needed it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If there was extra, he could give some to Adriana to help her improve her strength and better deal with Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"These are not enough!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If I truly pass the 27th level trial and still have the chance to exchange, I must exchange for more Perfect Dragon Elixirs!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, the battle points I earn should easily exchange for a bunch of Perfect Dragon Elixirs!" Thinking of this, Osborne took the jadeflare vial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Thank you all!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Osborne accept it, the women were all very happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They said, "We are so grateful to you! We did nothing; it was entirely you who led us through to get here! This little gift can't truly express how we feel..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No need to be so polite! We're friends!" Osborne said with a smile, changing the subject, "Let's go! Let's keep moving up! I hope the upcoming trials will still allow teamwork. That way, we can earn more battle points..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then they all left the eighteenth floor and entered the nineteenth floor.</span></p><div class="pagination">
