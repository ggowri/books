  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Is it? I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re rejoicing too early.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne remained unperturbed by Paul&rsquo;s control of his arms, even with contempt on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul was instantly puzzled. But the next second, he suddenly let out a miserable scream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">An alloy dagger suddenly flew from behind him and viciously stabbed at his heart. Fortunately, he reacted extremely fast and instantly moved his body. He dodged, allowing the dagger to just stab into his shoulder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But the sharp dagger directly pierced through his shoulder. At the same time, a strong, high-voltage electricity erupted, causing his body to tremble and stiffen. He couldn&rsquo;t move for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was Osborne&rsquo;s doing, naturally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Though Paul controlled his shoulders, the ocular energy of his Satan&rsquo;s Eye quickly took control of the alloy dagger he had thrown out earlier and stabbed it hard at Paul&rsquo;s heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Unfortunately, Paul reacted too quickly to be killed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But that was enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Taking advantage of Paul&rsquo;s body stiffening from the high voltage electricity, Osborne violently wrenched away from his grip and reached out to grab Paul&rsquo;s chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He wasn&rsquo;t trying to attack Paul, but&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">To rob something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In an instant, Osborne grabbed the necklace around Paul&rsquo;s neck and viciously ripped it off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was at that instant that Paul regained his mobility. Seeing Osborne rip the necklace off his neck, he roared in a frantic rage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Give it back.&rdquo; Paul&rsquo;s eyes were red, and he tried to snatch the necklace from Osborne&rsquo;s hand as if he were crazy. Unfortunately, Osborne moved faster and kicked Paul out of the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, Osborne, holding the necklace, looked at Paul with a sneer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul was trembling violently. The scarlet in his eyes was fading fast, as were the fangs in his mouth and his sharp nails.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;No! No! Give it back!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul roared with rage as he felt the changes in his body. He rushed at Osborne again, trying to retrieve the necklace. Unfortunately, having recovered his original shape, he was unable to overpower Osborne in terms of strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Combined with the fact that he had one shoulder pierced by a dagger, he was not as strong as he was at his peak. Osborne had the upper hand by binding Paul&rsquo;s legs and hands with ocular energy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Sure it is.&rdquo; Osborne beat back Paul and sneered, &ldquo;Paul, you really aren&rsquo;t one of the real Blood Clan. You were only able to shapeshift because of this necklace, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, Osborne carefully looked at the necklace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The shape of the necklace was a blood-red cross, which was emitting a faint red light at the moment, much like the legendary ancient artifact, Cain&rsquo;s Blood Cross.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was the red light it emitted that flooded into Paul&rsquo;s body and suddenly transformed Paul into the Blood Clan&rsquo;s appearance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Therefore, Osborne had determined that Paul&rsquo;s shapeshifting was directly related to this Blood Cross.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had just assumed that if he snatched it, Paul wouldn&rsquo;t be able to shapeshift again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s guess was apparently correct.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul&rsquo;s expression at this point was bleak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Osborne, damn you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul stopped pretending and resumed his original voice, which was filled with murderous intent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa, inside the car, was utterly stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This person was actually Paul.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">How was this possible?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa looked at Paul with an incredibly complicated expression. She hadn&rsquo;t expected that the leader of her bodyguard unit, whom she trusted immensely, would actually be the assassin who had attacked her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Captain Paul, why did you betray me?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa asked through clenched teeth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul sneered, &ldquo;Why? I&rsquo;ll tell you at your graves when you&rsquo;re all in hell.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that, Clarissa was beyond disappointed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne, however, looked calm. &ldquo;It will be you who goes to hell. You don&rsquo;t think you still have a chance, do you?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul said contemptuously, &ldquo;Osborne, do you think you&rsquo;ve won? You have no idea how powerful the Aberrants is. There is no future for those who make enemies of the Aberrants.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He looked back at Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ms. Radcliffe, don&rsquo;t you want to know why I betrayed you? I knew that I would die if I didn&rsquo;t betray you. I didn&rsquo;t want to die. I wanted to be somebody. So I wouldn&rsquo;t be stupid enough to offend The Aberrants to protect you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa was very cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;If you were afraid of danger and didn&rsquo;t want to protect me, you could have said it. I am not someone who forces people to work for me. You didn&rsquo;t have to betray me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul said scornfully, &ldquo;Said it? Would I have a future then? As for betrayal, I&rsquo;ve got better bosses, so naturally I&rsquo;m going to serve them wholeheartedly.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa&rsquo;s expression was terrible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Osborne, kill him.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne nodded. &ldquo;At your service.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, Osborne approached Paul.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul didn&rsquo;t panic and sneered, &ldquo;Do you think you can kill me? Do you really think the Aberrants only sent Raymond to kill you this time? Ms. Reed, aren&rsquo;t you going to make a move yet?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A sudden burst of laughter erupted around them as Paul finished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Pamela Reed said, &ldquo;Paul, you&rsquo;re useless. You can&rsquo;t even do poisoning well. Luckily, the organization didn&rsquo;t put all their hopes on you. Otherwise, we would have failed again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;But now&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Let me kill the beautiful Ms. Radcliffe myself.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As she finished speaking, a terrifying tornado appeared out of thin air and enveloped Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was stunned.</p><div class="pagination">
