  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled, choosing not to argue.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marlon currently held the 40th position on the Godson Rankings. Among the younger generation, the only name above him was the late Cuthbert.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">According to the rules of the Honor Quest Ceremony, Marlon would be the last challenger Osborne would face. To get to Marlon, Osborne first had to defeat over a hundred other contenders ranked below him on Blue Planet.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This meant that Osborne needed to achieve at least a hundred consecutive victories before he could even think about facing Marlon.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was no wonder Wesson doubted his chances.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Osborne had different plans.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne had locked himself away for a solid two weeks, and not only had he met his training goals, he had exceeded them. His strength had skyrocketed beyond what he had been before.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His Spatial Domain, Thunder Realm, and Spirit Realm had all reached Level Two, and he was tantalizingly close to Level Three.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His Explosive Force had also hit proficiency level.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a surprising twist, Osborne had even managed to merge Explosive Force with Deadly Force, allowing him to wield explosive power with deadly precision.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In short, Osborne had undergone a significant transformation.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he were to face Cuthbert again, he was confident he could secure an easy victory. He estimated he had at least a forty percent chance of defeating all other challengers, paving the way for a showdown with Marlon.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for Isa?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne wasn't sure.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he kept that thought to himself. With Wesson and everyone else doubting him, voicing his confidence wouldn't change a thing.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He would prove himself at the Honor Quest Ceremony and leave everyone in awe.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Wesson Augustine, any updates on my grandfather?" Osborne asked, shifting the conversation.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson's expression turned grave as he nodded. "I haven't been able to reach the Godfather. He might be seriously injured; otherwise, he wouldn't have gone silent on me."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne clenched his fists at the news.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian was the backbone of both the Augustine family and the Draco Group. With him at the helm, they were safe from threats.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, with Sebastian injured and missing, both the Augustine family and the Draco Group were in peril.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The League of Divine Descent was pressing in, and the Aberrants posed a constant threat.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without Sebastian to anchor them, they were all in jeopardy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the past, Sebastian had been like a massive umbrella, shielding them from all external dangers. He might not have been the strongest, but he was the heart and soul of the Augustine family, their protector in the Draco Group.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, with him missing, everything had changed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Relying solely on Wesson wouldn't be enough to safeguard either the family or the group.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's face darkened with concern.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "If something has happened to the Godfather and he doesn't return... then I'll have to step up and hold the Augustine family and the Draco Group together!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But that's a worry for another day. Right now, I need to focus on clearing the Honor Quest Ceremony and passing the Seventh Inheritance Trial by the Godfather!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If I can't even succeed in the Honor Quest Ceremony, how can I hope to support the Augustine family and the Draco Group? I'd just be crushed by the League of Divine Descent and the Aberrants!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With his fists tightened and his expression steely, he spoke, "As soon as you hear from the Godfather, please let me know immediately. Also, let's use this Axe of Strength as the prize for the Honor Quest Ceremony."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne reached into his Dimensional Space and pulled out the Axe of Strength.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This legendary weapon had once belonged to Luca, the sixth disciple of Gerardo, and was one of the three axes of the river god Hermes.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Axe of Strength was a Premium divine artifact, more than worthy of being the prize for the Honor Quest Ceremony.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Handing the Axe of Strength to Wesson, Osborne strode out, determination etched on his face.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson stared at Osborne, noticing something distinctly different about him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's entire demeanor had shifted; he exuded an authority that was palpable, even to someone like Wesson, a Class S Supreme Overlord. Despite the respect still evident in their conversation, there was an undeniable pressure that made Wesson feel small.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How strange..." Wesson murmured to himself, shaking off the feeling as he turned his attention back to organizing the Honor Quest Ceremony.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With Sebastian absent, the burden of leading the Augustine family and managing the Draco Group fell squarely on his shoulders, and it was starting to weigh heavily.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The feeling of helplessness gnawed at him. There was no one he could turn to for support.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, as Osborne and Emma stepped out of Mount One, they found a secluded spot away from prying eyes. In a burst of emotion, Emma rushed into Osborne's arms, clinging to him tightly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled softly and gently patted her head.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He asked, "What's wrong?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma looked up, biting her lip. "Osborne, I did something wrong."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyebrows shot up in surprise. "What did you do?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A mix of hesitation and struggle crossed Emma's face. She opened her mouth several times, but the words just wouldn't come out.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What is it?" Osborne pressed gently.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Taking a deep breath, Emma bit her lip harder, her eyes filled with worry. "Osborne, I... I told Clarissa about our relationship! You... you won't be mad at me, will you?"</p><div class="pagination">
