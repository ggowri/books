  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a simple plan forming in his mind, Osborne focused on healing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held the milky Essence Crystal tightly in his hand, its surface cool against his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> this is what an Essence Crystal looks like?" he murmured to himself, studying the crystal as if it held the answers to all his questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, the air was thick with the scent of death, a miasma that, once inhaled, would sap the life from any human unfortunate enough to breathe it in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To cultivate power here, one couldn't draw directly from the natural energies of the world; instead, one had to harness the pure energy contained within Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this one was just a low-grade specimen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, "The energy inside is surprisingly potent. It's easy to absorb and quick to use. If I had enough of these, I could probably cultivate faster than if I were drawing from the ambient energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Essence Crystals I have, the faster I'll progress!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with most of the mines under the Dark Deity Legion's control, humans toil endlessly just to scrape together a few. The Legion takes the lion's share, leaving us with barely enough to survive. At this rate, their power will only grow while ours dwindles, turning humanity into mere vassals of the Dark Deity Legion, slaves to Lord Malevolence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought filled Osborne with frustration, but he knew he couldn't change the situation overnight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First things first, I need to focus on recovery," he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne concentrated, channeling the energy from the Essence Crystal into his battered Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he absorbed the energy, he quickly realized it wasn't nearly enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His injuries were severe, wounds that might as well have been inflicted by a Cosmic Treasure. The Essence Crystal's power was too weak to make a dent in his condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This won't cut it. Even if I had a million Essence Crystals, I wouldn't heal like this! I need another plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have to restore the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I could just revive it, even a little, I know it would help mend my wounds. Plus, with the Lotus' protection, I'd gain an immortal body. In this perilous </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, that would give me a fighting chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But reviving the Lotus might be even tougher than healing myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frowning deeply, Osborne stood up and walked out of the room, his gaze drifting toward a distant mountain range.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the Essence Crystal mining area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mountains were riddled with countless tunnels extending deep into the earth. If luck was on their side, a Junior Deity could dig out a handful of low-grade Essence Crystals after laboring for hours each day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, each month, they were required to turn in at least three hundred crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Intermediate Deities had to submit a thousand, and Superior Deities three thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia, one a Junior Deity and the other an Intermediate Deity, had to contribute a total of 13 hundred Essence Crystals every month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, the majority of their days were spent underground in the mines. They barely scraped by to meet their monthly quotas, leaving little to spare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's tough! Too tough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but sympathize with them. In a different world, like Blue Planet, with their talent and strength, they would be among the elite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But here, in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, they were trapped in a brutal cycle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe I can help them," Osborne thought, a spark of determination igniting within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided to head to the mines and see how the Essence Crystals were extracted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his Satan's Eye, he possessed a natural advantage, a powerful ability to see through obstacles. Perhaps he could assist Harry and Amelia in their efforts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the energy needed to restore the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity had to be immense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps the opportunity lies within those mines," he mused, feeling a renewed sense of purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a firm resolve, Osborne set his sights on the mining area. As he walked, he encountered several filthy villagers, their faces smeared with dirt and exhaustion. They barely glanced at him, their eyes vacant, and then turned away, moving like specters toward the mines without uttering a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne kept his silence as well. He knew that in his current state, any misplaced words could spell trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drawing attention from the Dark Deity overseers was not something he could afford.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon enough, he arrived near the mines, his gaze drawn upward to the colossal mountains looming above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing at the base of these towering giants, which soared tens of thousands of yards high, he couldn't help but feel dwarfed, utterly insignificant&mdash;like an ant beneath a boulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaking his head, Osborne chose a nearby tunnel and ventured inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The labyrinthine structure of the mine was both daunting and fascinating. As he delved deeper, the absence of other miners emboldened him, and he activated his Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the world transformed around Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What had once seemed like solid rock became transparent, revealing the hidden treasures within. Thanks to the power of Satan's Eye, he effortlessly spotted Essence Crystals embedded deep within the earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's collection of Essence Crystals continued to grow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, he had unearthed dozens of low-grade Essence Crystals hidden deep within the vicinity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The number of Essence Crystals seems rather limited," Osborne mused, hesitating for a moment. He decided against mining them and pressed on further into the mine's </span><span>depths instead</span></p><div class="pagination">
