  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned by Isa's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seriously, Isa? Now's the time to ask that? What am I supposed to say?" he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For any man, this was an impossible question to answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Admit to being a player? Or confess it was all just a game?" he pondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne dared to say that, Isa would probably kill him on the spot. The icy look in her eyes was no joke. If he didn't answer well, Osborne knew he'd be beaten to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's hesitation, Osborne decided not to answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he cupped Isa's delicate face and kissed her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next second, she pushed him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The coldness in Isa's eyes intensified. "Answer my question before you kiss me again. Otherwise, for every kiss you've stolen, I'll knock out a tooth. And then, I'll cut your dick off, so you can't harm any more women."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a shiver run down his spine at her words. He forced a bitter smile. "Isa, isn't that a bit harsh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa scoffed, "Well? Are you going to answer or not? Don't you feel sorry for your girlfriend? Or are you planning to make a choice?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath, knowing there was no way to avoid this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He calmly replied, "Only kids make choices. I just want them all! Clarissa is the woman I love, and you, Isa, you're also the woman I love! So, I choose to have you all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was momentarily stunned by his words, then replied coldly, "Do you think this is some kind of joke? What makes you think you can have it all? What makes you think I could accept this? Tell me, if your woman loved another man besides you, could you accept that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face turned cold as well, and he responded seriously, "No, I couldn't accept it. I'd kill that man!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Isa laughed. "You really are domineering, such a macho attitude! But are you suggesting that I should go and kill Clarissa? You can be overbearing, so why can't I be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to be my man, I am fine with that. But if you're my man and still have feelings for another woman, can I go and kill that woman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in panic. "What, are you scared?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa sneered, "Are you afraid I'll actually kill Clarissa? You think you can be domineering and macho, wanting this and that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne fell completely silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa continued, "If you can't answer that, then don't bother messing with me! Unless one day, your power surpasses mine and I have no choice but to submit to you. Even if you love many women, I wouldn't be able to do anything about it...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, if you sleep with me, I'll take you as my only man. I won't tolerate sharing my man with other women, so I'll kill every other woman you love!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Isa wiped the corner of her mouth and turned to sit back on the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood there, stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Isa meant what she said. She was more than capable of doing that, and she had the power to back it up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but give a wry smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Isa's cold expression, Osborne gritted his teeth and said, "Fine! I'll do my best. Sooner or later, my strength will surpass yours! And when that day comes, I'll take you both for myself. Let's see what you can do about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa rolled her eyes at his words. "Are you provoking me? Looking for trouble?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly and shook his head. "Of course not! You're the one who said it. Once I'm stronger than you, you'll submit to me and won't care how many women I have."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly pulled Isa back up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cupped her delicate face again, ignoring the threat in her eyes, and said with a grin, "Besides, Isa, you said that only after I sleep with you will you consider me your man. Worst case, I'll hold off on that for now...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But right now, I just want to kiss you, to taste your sweet little tongue! That's not a problem, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, Isa let out a cold snort and was about to retort when Osborne leaned in and kissed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes went wide with shock, and she bit down hard, drawing blood from Osborne's lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have a death wish?" Isa spat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, unfazed by the blood trickling down his chin, just grinned. "Isa, you're too gorgeous. As long as I get to kiss you, I'd be willing to die by your hand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned in and kissed her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa froze, the metallic taste of Osborne's blood mixing with saliva filling her mouth. The sensation was far from pleasant. She clenched her fists several times, wanting to punch Osborne away and teach this playboy a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, she didn't act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her clenched fists slowly relaxed as she reluctantly closed her eyes, letting Osborne continue the kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like forever, Osborne finally pulled away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's neck was flushed crimson, but her eyes remained defiant as she glared at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Disgusting!" she snapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wiping the blood from the corner of her mouth, she added, "Your blood reeks. Next time this happens, don't even think about kissing me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but laugh at her words. "So, in other situations, it means I can kiss you, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa glared at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked, then reached out and pulled Isa tightly into his arms. "Isa, thank you."</span></p><div class="pagination">
