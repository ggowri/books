  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna's laughter was cold and dismissive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who do you think could actually take him down?" she said, clearly unconvinced by Osborne's bravado. To her, his confidence seemed like nothing more than empty threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do whatever you want," she added with a dismissive wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words said one thing, but her face betrayed her concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew fate wasn't so easily changed and worried that Osborne and Clarissa might be walking into a trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All she could do was to protect them as best as she could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe they'll realize the danger and back off. It might break Clarissa's heart, but at least she'd be safe," she thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Donna's gaze turned serious as she addressed Osborne and Clarissa. "Listen up. I'm okay with you two being together, but I need to make one thing clear. Until you sort out the engagement with Apollo and get the Radcliffe family's approval, you two can date, hold hands, and even kiss if you can't help yourselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you mustn't cross the final line. No sex, understood?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, I will..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blushing bright red, Clarissa cut her off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Auntie, stop! You're making me blush!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at Osborne, who was watching her with a hint of amusement, causing her to look away, her cheeks burning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna's eyes remained sharp as she stared at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing he needed to make a commitment, Osborne cleared his throat and said, "Ms. Donna Radcliffe, don't worry. I promise we won't do anything out of line until all this is sorted."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna seemed satisfied with his promise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember what you said," she warned before walking away, her face still filled with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Donna was out of sight, Clarissa's face relaxed into a bright, happy smile. She looked up at Osborne with affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grinned and gently took her hand. "Let's go for a walk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay!" she replied, her voice full of enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They walked side by side, her smile lighting up her face as they strolled together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This feels so nice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment was sweet but fleeting as night began to fall. They knew it was time to leave the manor and head to Silent Valley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silent Valley was the venue for the high-stakes showdown between Skyefall Security and Chevalier Security tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The challenge was straightforward, which was capturing the flag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this intense competition, a flag would be planted right in the center of the valley. Skyefall Security and Chevalier Security would approach from opposite ends, armed only with personal weapons. They were strictly forbidden from using helicopters, armored vehicles, rocket launchers, or any heavy artillery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whoever could seize the flag and carry it out first would win, and the victor would walk away with a ten-billion-dollar wager.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>News of this epic bet had spread throughout the elite circles of Skyefall, largely thanks to the Chevalier family's strategic publicity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire high society was buzzing with anticipation for the clash between these two security giants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Invitations had been extended to the top families. Aside from the Chevalier and Radcliffe families, representatives from the five oldest and most powerful families, Mellon, Lark, Morgan, Carnegie, and Adams, had all arrived in Mayby City to witness the event.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These five old families were the powerhouses of Skyefall. With their backing, it was clear that no one could afford to renege on the bet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alongside them were some top-tier wealthy families like the Montague family from Mayby City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they weren't quite on par with the old families in influence, they still carried significant weight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As dusk settled, the area around Silent Valley was alive with activity. Convoys of luxury vehicles arrived, each carrying security teams and spectators eager to see the outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo had arrived early, surrounded by a massive entourage of over two hundred people. Standing beside him was a commanding figure in his forties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Apollo's father, Derek, the head of the Chevalier family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek surveyed the gathering with a worried frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apollo, are you sure about this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This bet is huge. Winning would not only solidify Chevalier Security's position as the top security firm in Skyefall but also elevate our family's status above the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if we lose, the financial hit would be devastating. And with so many watching, a loss would seriously damage our reputation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't afford that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek looked at Apollo seriously while Apollo's confidence remained unshaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He flashed a grin and said, "Dad, you have nothing to worry about. I never take on a challenge unless I'm certain of winning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With Viper Squad on our side, victory is a guarantee!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
