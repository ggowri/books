  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly absorbed the flood of information pouring from the sapling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His jaw dropped in astonishment as the revelations unfolded before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "A bolt of lightning from beyond the chaos shattered the World Tree, splitting the chaos apart! That's how the Big Bang occurred, giving birth to the cosmos we inhabit!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remnants of the shattered World Tree scattered across the cosmos, yet they didn't completely lose their vitality. After countless years of absorbing enough energy, new saplings of the World Tree began to sprout from these decayed trunks!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There are a total of nine such saplings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The one before me is one of those nine&mdash;it's the last one to grow!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's still in its juvenile stage...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be precise, these newly sprouted World Trees can't be considered true World Trees. They're merely offshoots of the original! Because there can only be one true World Tree!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It must absorb and merge with all eight of its offshoots to truly grow into a new World Tree! Only then can it wield the genuine power of the World Tree, the kind of strength that can support the entire cosmos!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was a canvas of shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he fully processed this information and looked back at the sapling, all that remained was awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An offshoot of the World Tree! Among the nine offshoots, this one is the last to sprout! It's the ninth offshoot!" he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of the World Tree was beyond words, and Osborne couldn't help but feel a sense of reverence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that the World Tree was far more powerful than the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. After all, it was the World Tree that upheld the chaos, allowing creatures like the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many beings similar to the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity once thrived in the chaos, but they all depended on absorbing the energy of the World Tree to grow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The World Tree was undeniably superior!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even its offshoots were stronger than the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, the root creature that attacked me in the deep space was actually an offshoot of the World Tree?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And those massive humanoid statues in the core of the divine peak, entwined with roots, are also from the same World Tree?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There are nine offshoots in total!" Osborne mused, piecing it all together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, another wave of information surged into his mind, causing his expression to harden dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This offshoot of the World Tree senses danger! It's still fresh out of the ground and stands no chance against the other eight offshoots! Right now, it's aware that one of its siblings is nearby, and it could discover this one at any moment, ready to absorb and merge with it... It's actually seeking my help and protection!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mouth fell open in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This offshoot has consciousness! Though it's not very strong yet, I should be able to communicate with it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination, Osborne set to work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a period of focused effort, he found that he could connect with the offshoot using his soul power, engaging in simple exchanges of thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This connection felt incredibly fascinating to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, human from the cosmos. I am the ninth offshoot of the World Tree. You can call me Primordial!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Osborne's mind, the resonant voice of the World Tree's embodiment echoed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly responded, "Hello, Primordial! My name is Osborne Augustine. You mentioned that you need my help and protection? How can I assist you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I have already sensed it. Not far from this world, another offshoot of the World Tree has detected my presence! It is currently engaged in a fierce battle with a human, which is why it hasn't come after me yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once it defeats that human, it will surely leave to find me and absorb me. I do not want to be absorbed by another World Tree offshoot, but I am just born and very weak, unable to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Therefore, I propose a deal to gain your help and protection. What I need you to do is let me enter your Soul Current Ocean. I can feel that your Soul Current Ocean is unique, containing pure soul power that will help me grow and evolve more quickly, allowing me to develop faster."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Primordial finished, Osborne frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Enter my Soul Current Ocean? That's impossible! If you enter my Soul Current Ocean, even the slightest movement could mean my death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have no fear. Before entering your Soul Current Ocean, I will merge with you. Then, you will be me, and I will be you. If you die, I will die as well."</span></p><div class="pagination">
