  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin was instantly electrified by Athena's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? There are Miracle Elixirs atop Divine Peak Nine that can heal my divine power essence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed her arm, eyes wide with fervor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Athena replied coolly, "Do I have any reason to lie to you? You've already hit rock bottom; I should have just tossed you aside, but I didn't. That alone should tell you I haven't given up on you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are all sorts of incredible Miracle Elixirs up there. If you've got the guts to go after them, restoring your divine power essence will be straightforward. You could break through and become a Deity Overlord or even reach the pinnacle of Deity Overlord... becoming a Deity King isn't out of the question either!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In short, Divine Peak Nine is a treasure trove! Even the esteemed Lord Malevolence is drooling over the artifacts up there. If you can survive long enough to venture deep into the peak, you could come back loaded!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin's excitement soared, but it was short-lived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, a shadow of doubt crossed his features. "If even the esteemed Lord Malevolence is coveting those treasures, that means they aren't easy to come by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His power is legendary&mdash;if he can't manage it, what chance do I have as a mere cripple?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair seeped back into Calvin's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Athena insisted, "Nothing is absolute! The beauty of Divine Peak Nine is that it's not just the strong who can reap its rewards. In fact, the dangers are the same for everyone, regardless of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Many weaker Transcendent Deities have achieved immense success there, while even Deity King warriors have met their end!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, there's at least a glimmer of hope, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is your last shot. If you can get to Divine Peak Nine and secure a Miracle Elixir, you can recover! And if not... well, dying there wouldn't be the worst fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you want to regain your strength and get revenge on Osborne? And what about Spark of Blaze? Don't you want to wipe him out, too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her words, a fierce glint ignited in Calvin's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely! I can't wait to flay that bastard Osborne alive and grind him to dust! And Spark of Blaze? They have to pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Athena smiled, a glint of determination in her own eyes, "Then go for it! Once we reach the base, I'll arrange a team to protect you as you approach Divine Peak Nine. How far you go depends on your luck. That's all I can do for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin bit his lip, suddenly pulling Athena into a tight embrace. "Athena, I will get that Miracle Elixir! Just wait for me&mdash;I'll make you proud!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Athena laughed </span><span>softly,</span><span> her expression warm but resolute. "I'll be waiting!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, let's get ready to land. I need to pilot the Malevolence Airship down. Even if you don't manage to find the Miracle Elixir, I promise you this. I won't let that bastard Osborne off easy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's child's play to get rid of someone on Divine Peak Nine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Athena finished speaking, her eyes caught sight of the encampment not far away, which was shielded by a massive divine power barrier. She immediately guided the </span><span>Malevolence Airship closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine Peak Nine encampment, we're here!" she announced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people on the deck saw the enormous divine power barrier and immediately felt a mix of anticipation and nervousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such a huge divine power barrier! This encampment must be as big as Wild Flame City. How much Essence Crystal does it take to maintain that?" someone muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, another voice chimed in, "It's a Supreme divine power barrier. They say even a Deity King-level warrior would have a hard time breaking through. It would take several Deity King warriors working together to stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the Essence Crystal consumption&mdash;there's an Essence Crystal mine near Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The density of Essence Crystals there is higher than anywhere else. Even top-grade Essence Crystals and Ultimate Essence Crystals are found in abundance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, it's dangerous, but we'll never run short of Essence Crystals. Our main task here will be to protect the miners. So don't worry about the supply running out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Turns out we're here to protect the miners! Even though we can't get close to Divine Peak Nine and won't be able to touch Celestial Crystals or Miracle Elixirs, we have a shot at Ultimate Essence Crystals. With Ultimate Essence Crystals, our cultivation speeds will skyrocket a hundredfold. That's a resource even Upper Race geniuses struggle to obtain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excitement rippled through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the meantime, Athena's Malevolence Airship, along with four others, finally glided through the portal in the divine power barrier and entered the encampment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a two-day journey, the more than 50 thousand reinforcements from the Wild Flame Army had finally arrived at the encampment near Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eyes swept across the encampment, filled with a mix of curiosity and resolve.</span></p><div class="pagination">
