Osborne said, turning to Clara and Leroy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both girls were still dumbfounded, staring at the rankings on their badges, their breaths coming in quick bursts. It felt surreal. They were terrified that all of this was just an illusion and that they'd wake up the next second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of them had amassed a whopping 5.8 million points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, they were right behind Agatha, Horace, Osborne, Broderick, and Benson, sharing the sixth-place ranking side by side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had 1.5 million more points than the person in eighth place!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this for real? We actually made it into the top ten?" Clara marveled, still grappling with the dizzying turn of events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like they hadn't done anything extraordinary, yet here they were, standing among the elite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She and Leroy turned their attention back to Osborne, who wore a knowing smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "This is just a temporary spot! Soon, we'll become prime targets for the stronger teams. With our combined points nearing 20 million, anyone who takes us down will snag close to two million points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Any top team that manages to beat us will jump right into the top ten. It's only natural that we'll become the bullseye for everyone looking to plunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leroy, even you are just barely hanging on in the top 100 in strength leaderboard! In the eyes of those powerhouse squads, we're nothing but easy pickings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave a casual shrug. "Well, this is where the real battle kicks off! To keep our spot in the top 10, we've gotta fend off every single gutsy challenger who dares to take a shot at us. We might even end up going head-to-head with Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, if any of them manages to knock us out, they'll leapfrog the competition and claim the number one spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So... are you guys scared?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished his speech, Leroy and Clara narrowed their eyes as they fully grasped the enormity of the challenges lying ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A palpable tension filled the air, but in the end, determination sparked in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With you beside us, we've got no fear! Anybody who dares to come after us better brace themselves for a serious fight back! Even if it's Agatha, Horace, or Broderick and Benson... if they want our points, they'll have to work their butts off for it!" Clara declared, her voice crackling with fighting spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy nodded vigorously in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne flashed a grin, clearly pleased. "That's the attitude! That's what it takes to stay in the top ten! Now, let's get back together. I've got a hunch that it won't be long before some folks come sniffing around to steal our points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get ready for a showdown!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two girls nodded eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did they realize that the spike in their points had sent shockwaves rippling through Frost Peak City, throwing everyone into a frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vice-presidents of the Eight Great Academies shot to their feet, their faces contorted in disbelief as they stared at the leaderboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy was ranked sixth with 5.8 million points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that split second, they were rendered completely speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy, a disciple of Azure Haven Academy, had amassed a score that was more than double Jared's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a bit of luck, it seemed almost certain that Leroy was on track to secure a place in the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments ago, they had been pointing fingers at Leroy, even pressuring Maisie to impose harsh penalties on her, believing that Leroy was to blame for the Eight Great Academies failing to secure a spot in the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, in a stunning twist, Leroy's score shot up to 5.8 million, landing her a solid sixth place, completely obliterating their claims.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sixth place! A position Jared had never even come close to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, all seven vice presidents turned to Maisie, who had confusion and disbelief across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Leroy made it into the top ten? And she's ranked sixth with 5.8 million points?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is this some sort of dream? Am I seeing things?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the uproar resonating through Frost Peak City confirmed it was all too real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy from Azure Haven Academy had genuinely broken into the top ten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, Maisie stood tall, pride radiating from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shot a smug look at Ezra from Radiant Enigmas Academy. "Well, Mr. Ezra Monroe, what do you have to say now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our Leroy is in the top ten! Her score is over double Jared's! Didn't you say it was Leroy who caused the Eight Great Academies to miss out on the top ten?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, it seems our only hope rests on Leroy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ezra's face flickered with trepidation. He wanted to argue, but seeing Leroy's impressive score and sixth-place ranking left him speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Maisie had noted, from now on, the Eight Great Academies could only count on Leroy to maintain her score and secure their position in the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was no time to accuse Leroy; such a move would surely incite backlash from the other academy vice presidents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Ezra opted for silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, not far away, Angela and Danilo stood slack-jawed, staring at the streaming leaderboard. They gazed at Osborne's name shining in third place, utterly astounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danilo exclaimed, disbelief lacing his tone, "Third place?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne overtook both Broderick and Benson, and he's only trailing Agatha and Horace!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow!" Angela echoed, both of them reeling from the turn of events.</span></p><div class="pagination">
