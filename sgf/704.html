  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Palmers sneered. "Scared? If you're scared, kneel and beg me. Maybe I'll spare your life and make </span><span>you</span><span> my dog!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned cold when he heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa also became furious. She gritted her teeth and said, "Osborne, you go fight him! Don't worry about me, I'll handle him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa pointed at Luca.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca smiled faintly. "The grown-up </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span>? How bold of you to choose me as your opponent. I might not kill you, but I can capture you alive and present you to the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have that skill?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa gritted her teeth and said, "You killed my family, abducted my relatives. Today, I will personally kill you to avenge them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Clarissa gripped the Fate Staff tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne opened his mouth. Sensing Clarissa's determination, he could only nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma took a deep breath and said helplessly, "Osborne, I'm starting to regret coming to help you! I didn't realize the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> were so determined to kill you. I didn't expect we'd face so many and such powerful enemies!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since I'm already here, and they probably won't let me leave, let's fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at the fourteen Class AAA Evolved Humans, licked her lips, with madness in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder if I can handle it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll give it a try. You better take down your enemies quickly and help me. If I die, it'll be your fault!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression grew even more serious upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded and said, "Thank you! No matter what happens today, I owe you one. If </span><span>you can't hold on, just leave. You don't have to stay and die with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Osborne looked at Palmers with an icy gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bring it on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I beat you half a month ago, and I can do it again now! Since you're making a move, prepare to die. I won't hold back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Palmers burst into laughter at these words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Arrogant! Half a month ago, I was careless. Today, I'll show you how powerful the Dark Realm is. You'll be tortured to death by me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took out the Goddess of Grain's scythe from the Dimensional Space, ready for battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the scythe, Palmers grew even angrier because that divine artifact originally belonged to his grandfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half a month ago, he lost to Osborne, which caused his grandfather to lose a bet with the Godfather and forfeit two divine artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of those artifacts was the scythe now in Osborne's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other was the swallow shield in Emma's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Palmers looked at the two divine artifacts and sneered, "Perfect! Today, I'll kill both of you, and these artifacts will return to their rightful owner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he attacked immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't have time to react before everything went dark. Not just ordinary darkness, but a void where everything vanished, with no trace of light anywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't sense anything around him except the dark elemental.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this the Dark Realm?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In this realm, the dark elemental is so dense that all other elemental forces have nearly vanished! Here, I can't even use any powers except dark power! Unless my control over abilities is stronger than Palmers'!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally understood why the Realm was so powerful. The controller of the Realm gains immense power, while their opponents are severely weakened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless the power gap is vast, how could they possibly lose?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and activated Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in the Realm, Satan's Eye was less effective. Fortunately, Osborne also had dark power, so he could still see Palmers' position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, how does it feel? Does the power of the Realm make you despair?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha! Don't worry, I won't kill you quickly. I'll torture you slowly! I'll let you die slowly in despair!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Palmers said this viciously, he suddenly waved his hand, instantly summoning a terrifying force of darkness that surged towards Osborne's chest and exploded violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't dodge in time. He only managed to release his martial art aura to protect his body, but he was still struck. The immense dark force caused his martial art aura to fluctuate wildly, and his body was thrown back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is just ten percent of my power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Palmers sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a cold snort, his expression extremely serious as he quickly considered a solution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the Dark Realm, I can't draw on the elemental forces of the void. I can only use the energy within my body and pure physical strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Under these conditions, trying to fight Palmers is incredibly difficult!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I must break through his Dark Realm!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
