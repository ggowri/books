  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne sneered at Cuthbert, his face full of disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Holy Light of Redemption!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as his Light Realm was about to shatter, Osborne quickly used the Holy Light of Redemption on himself. He had taken some injuries and drained quite a bit of mental energy from going head-to-head with Cuthbert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, as the Holy Light descended, his injuries were instantly healed, and his mental energy returned to peak condition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was as if he had never fought at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So what if I lost my Light Realm? I can still beat you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne sneered at Cuthbert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Osborne's Light Realm finally shattered completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne felt the backlash of mental energy, but his mind was strong enough, and thanks to the Holy Light of Redemption, his mental energy was at its peak. The backlash wasn't enough to cause him serious harm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert froze, staring in shock as Osborne's body fully healed and his condition returned to top form. He felt shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His expression grew dark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The spectators below the stage were all stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had expected Cuthbert to easily defeat Osborne after using his Power Realm, but to their shock, it was Osborne who had the upper hand!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne had forced Cuthbert to self-destruct his Power Realm!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many among the crowd also possessed Light Realms, but they knew theirs were useless in the face of someone like Cuthbert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet Osborne had used his Light Realm to push Cuthbert to the brink!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hiss!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many people gasped in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"His Light Realm seems different from ours! Why is his so powerful?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is my Light Realm fake or something?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is terrifying! He forced Cuthbert to self-destruct his Power Realm! Even if Cuthbert wins, he won't last much longer!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's taken a serious hit to his strength!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd broke into a flurry of heated discussion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert growled, "Damn kid, you're really a nuisance! But even if you've recovered, so what? Without your Light Realm, you can't possibly defeat me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if I have to burn through all my strength, I will beat you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert had resolved to go all out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He unleashed his power once more, launching a wild assault on Osborne. Without the restriction of the Light Realm, he easily closed the distance between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne didn't retreat either. The stage wasn't that large, and without the Light Realm to interfere with Cuthbert's perception, there was no way for him to avoid the attacks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The only thing he could do was face Cuthbert head-on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Taking a deep breath, Osborne used the Breath of Celestial to boost his power by 80%, and he clashed fiercely with Cuthbert once more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's strength was weaker than Cuthbert's, but his advanced combat techniques were slightly superior. While they couldn't completely bridge the gap, it was enough to make things difficult for Cuthbert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the blink of an eye, the two had exchanged over a hundred moves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By now, Cuthbert had given up on conserving energy. He only wanted to defeat Osborne quickly and secure his fiftieth straight win.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet Osborne was like an immovable stone. His Martial Art Aura was incredibly resilient, enduring over a hundred of Cuthbert's attacks without breaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Blood trickled from Osborne's mouth, and he had sustained significant injuries, but it wasn't enough to bring him down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert was utterly enraged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn brat! I'm ranked 36th on the Godson Rankings, the highest-ranked Godson of Earth in my generation! And you? You're just Class AA, ranked at the bottom of the list!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How can I not defeat you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fall!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert roared, his punches growing heavier with each strike. A faint glow appeared on his chest, the shimmering shadow of a radiant jewel beginning to manifest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was the ancient artifact jewel fused with Cuthbert's body!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The artifact's power surged through him, instantly boosting his strength to a level nearly as powerful as when he had used his Power Realm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, Osborne was sent flying, several bones in his chest snapping. He coughed up blood as his expression turned grim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stared at the glowing jewel on Cuthbert's chest, his face growing serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hahaha!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert laughed maniacally, "You little bastard, you've actually forced me to this point! You made the power jewel inside me activate on its own!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now, you're truly finished!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll crush you into paste!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Cuthbert attacked again, his terrifying power slamming into Osborne. Even Osborne's Martial Art Aura couldn't withstand the assault and shattered instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Pfft!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne spat out another mouthful of blood, the immense force caving in his chest. Blood trickled from his eyes and ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone watching could tell that Osborne had been seriously injured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The glowing jewel on Cuthbert's chest intensified, making his power overwhelmingly terrifying. Without his Light Realm, Osborne simply couldn't fend off such attacks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was going to lose!</p><div class="pagination">
