  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's Light Realm appeared, and Cuthbert was momentarily stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">According to his intel, Osborne was a spatial metahuman, known for his Spatial Domain, which he had used to defeat Andrew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How did it suddenly turn into a Light Realm?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dual realms?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert's expression grew cold. "So, you've been hiding your true strength all along!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne gave a faint smile, not bothering to reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd below the arena was equally shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many of them had seen Osborne in action before, watching him use his Spatial Domain to defeat Roger and Andrew. They expected him to use the same domain to pressure Cuthbert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instead, it was the Light Realm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dual realms!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He actually controls two realms!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd was taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert snorted. "You're only Class AA, yet you have two realms? And with that strong physical power, too? I admit I underestimated you. No wonder you're confident you can end my winning streak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But so what if you have dual realms? More realms don't mean more strength. The more you have, the harder it is to refine them and achieve real mastery!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if you had ten realms, they'd still be as fragile as glass in front of me, easy to shatter. What's the point?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert sneered with disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne remained calm. "Is that so? Break through my realm first before you start boasting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then I'll gladly oblige!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"First, I'll shatter your realm!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert launched his attack. His Strength Realm boosted his power immensely, each punch carrying terrifying force as he tried to violently break through Osborne's Light Realm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne wasn't idle either and retaliated against Cuthbert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dissolving Light!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Dissolving Light, an intermediate light power, became even more potent within the Light Realm. Osborne unleashed dozens of beams effortlessly, shooting at Cuthbert from all directions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert wasn't afraid. His body seemed unnaturally tough, allowing the beams of light to hit him as he continued to hammer Osborne's Light Realm with his fists.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Crash!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's Light Realm trembled violently but did not collapse. Countless rays intertwined, like threads in a web, giving it remarkable resilience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though Cuthbert's power was immense, he was still far from breaking Osborne's Light Realm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert's expression darkened again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sturdiness of Osborne's Light Realm was far beyond Cuthbert's expectations. Even his violent assaults couldn't break it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This left him feeling uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's Death Realm had already been highly resilient. He couldn't break it quickly. Cuthbert had suffered heavy losses and lost a lot of life energy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, Osborne's Light Realm was even more stable than that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was even stronger than Emma's Death Realm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Impossible! You're just Class AA, and it's rare enough to control one realm. How could you make your realm this stable?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert was now feeling the pressure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unable to break Osborne's Light Realm, Cuthbert constantly endured Osborne's attacks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although the Dissolving Light wasn't overly powerful to him, each hit forced him to expend considerable energy to defend against it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If this continued, he might not lose outright, but he'd definitely be exhausted and unable to continue the fight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nothing's impossible."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne replied, "The only reason you think it's impossible is that you're not strong enough. I told you, I'm ending your winning streak!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You've already lost!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert gritted his teeth. "Arrogant! You think you can beat me? You can't! Once I break through your Light Realm, I'll make you regret it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert's anger was starting to boil over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he continued to fail at breaking through Osborne's Light Realm, frustration set in. He now had two choices.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Either he could go all out to break through Osborne's Light Realm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For instance, he could self-detonate his Strength Realm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He believed that if he detonated his Strength Realm, it would definitely shatter Osborne's Light Realm along with it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But if he did that, he would suffer a severe mental backlash, and he wouldn't be able to use his Strength Realm for a while. How would he face stronger challengers after that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, self-detonating the Strength Realm wasn't an option.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That left him with only one choice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ignore Osborne's Light Realm and focus on matching his techniques.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't break Osborne's Light Realm, and Osborne couldn't break his Strength Realm. It would all come down to who had better skills!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that thought, Cuthbert shifted his strategy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I can't break your Light Realm, I'll just kill you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a flash, Cuthbert appeared right in front of Osborne and swung a powerful punch at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert's punch connected with Osborne's shoulder, unleashing a terrifying force. Osborne's defense couldn't hold up. His shoulder was instantly shattered, sending blood and flesh flying.</p><div class="pagination">
