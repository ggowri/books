  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Justin stared at Osborne&rsquo;s grin, a chilling fear creeping up his spine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It made Justin doubt himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Could Osborne&rsquo;s bomb be real?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Justin turned to the shopkeeper, his face twisted with rage, and started beating him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Tell me, is the bomb real or not?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Fake! It&rsquo;s all fake! The powder inside? It&rsquo;s just sand. I delivered it myself.&rdquo; The boss, unable to take the beating, cried out. &ldquo;Stop hitting me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne smirked, &ldquo;Justin, don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m underestimating you. You&rsquo;re a coward. Even if you beat him to death and he wasn&rsquo;t lying, you still wouldn&rsquo;t dare face me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Justin halted, his face twisted with rage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ignoring him, Osborne turned to Ophelia, &ldquo;Do you remember three months ago when I flipped the dining table?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia was taken aback but nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Three months ago, she and her stepmother, Evelyn Caldwell, were about to have dinner, however, Osborne went mad and flipped the table. Furious, they gave Osborne a harsh lesson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She remembered it vividly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Osborne, why bring this up? You&rsquo;ve done plenty of dumb things over the years; this one&rsquo;s no big deal.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne sneered, &ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m being dumb? Ha! If it weren&rsquo;t for me, you would have been dead by now, you fool. If I hadn&rsquo;t flipped your table, Justin would have poisoned you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Justin bribed your maid to lace your food with poison. With you out of the way, he&rsquo;d have no competition for the inheritance. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that right, Justin?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia frowned deeply, unable to believe it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Justin&rsquo;s eyes widened, teeth clenched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So, his poisoning plan from three months ago had been foiled by Osborne</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He loathed Osborne but dared not show it. He shouted, &ldquo;Slander! Osborne, you worthless scum, how dare you accuse me? No proof, just lies. Do you think Ophelia is an idiot? She&rsquo;s my cousin; why would I want to poison her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ophelia, this loser is trying to drive a wedge between us. You won&rsquo;t fall for it, will you?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia&rsquo;s face darkened, remaining silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne gave a faint smile and continued, &ldquo;If you think I&rsquo;m lying, Ophelia, just investigate. Start with the nanny.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Justin&rsquo;s face turned pale at Osborne&rsquo;s words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne continued, &ldquo;And a month ago, Justin sent his men to kill you. Luckily, I found out in time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;We fought in the dark, and you blamed me for making noise and disturbing your rest.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia&rsquo;s expression shifted again, staring at Osborne in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Do you have any proof? And why didn&rsquo;t you explain back then?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne shrugged. &ldquo;I said I didn&rsquo;t want you to worry. Would you have believed me?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia paused, biting her lip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Proof? That night, I injured their arms. Check it out. A month ago, did one of Justin&rsquo;s men have an arm injury? You&rsquo;ll find your answer.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Justin&rsquo;s face darkened instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Furious, he spat, &ldquo;You scoundrel! Trying to sow discord? It was a fight in the dark. How can you be sure they were my bodyguards? They couldn&rsquo;t see you, so how could you see them?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne looked at Justin with disdain, offering no explanation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What, should I tell him I have Satan&rsquo;s Eye and can see in the dark?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He turned to Ophelia with a mocking grin. &ldquo;Do you really trust Justin? Are you willing to bet the explosives on me are fake?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;If we go down together, who do you think benefits the most?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia clenched her fists, glaring at Osborne, but her mind was already made up.</p><div class="pagination">
