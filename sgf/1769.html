There are still two days until the challenge begins. I'd better set up the arena."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne suddenly waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air crackled with energy as he unleashed a powerful technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Cleaving!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A section of Divine Peak Nine, roughly six miles in diameter, was abruptly cleaved away, hovering in mid-air under Osborne's control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This will be the arena for our showdown," he declared confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he completed this task, Osborne's divine power surged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over six thousand miles away at the Divine Peak Nine base, a massive shadow appeared in the sky&mdash;Osborne's divine power projection, looming over the area with an air of dominance and disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, everyone at Divine Peak Nine was stirred into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They rushed outside, gazing up at Osborne's colossal figure, and their expressions shifted to one of shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Theodore's divine power projection!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Theodore is nearby!" someone exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They quickly recognized the shadow as Theodore's, thanks to Stellar Pursuit Mandate issued by the Bowman family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is he up to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does he dare to provoke us with a divine power projection? He's asking for trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is his real body?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Find him!" Many shouted in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, their attempts to sense Osborne's actual location yielded nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Osborne's voice thundered through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Greetings, talented warriors of all clans! The arena for our challenge has been prepared, located to the east of Divine Peak Nine. Just head east, and you'll find it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In two days, the Seven Young Deity Kings of Human Community will face off against all of your young warriors! But let me make this clear&mdash;only those who have reached the Deity King level are welcome to challenge us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those who haven't attained Deity King status should save themselves the embarrassment! We only accept challenges from the elite of your clans!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope you all rise to the occasion and don't let me down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne's voice reverberated through the Divine Peak Nine base, the expressions of the gathered warriors hardened dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who hadn't reached the Deity King level felt their blood surge, and their power nearly boiled over, struggling to contain themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock rippled through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy is just a divine power projection, and he's causing such a reaction? What kind of strength is this? Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many of the young warriors turned pale with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only those who had achieved the Deity King level remained unaffected by Osborne's voice, though they still furrowed their brows, staring at the imposing figure above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, another colossal shadow appeared in the sky, even larger than Osborne's projection, looming over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Theodore, you're too arrogant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In two days, I will personally defeat your Seven Young Deity Kings! I will avenge Alfred. Just wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the massive shadow launched a fist toward Osborne's projection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne's projection shattered into a million fragments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Tristram!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tristram, the first heir of the Bowman family! Even though he's younger than Alfred, he's already broken through to the Deity King realm and is nearing the mid-stage. If Tristram steps in, the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings don't stand a chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings are doomed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In two days, they'll be beaten to a pulp by the geniuses of the other races!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! How dare those lowly humans to challenge the other races?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd buzzed with loud and heated discussions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Osborne's shattered projection reappeared in the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze locked onto Tristram's projection, and he smirked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tristram? Early-stage Deity King at its peak? You're only brave enough to show off against my divine power projection! In two days, you won't even be worthy of facing me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the so-called geniuses of the other races are all at your level, I suggest you all just surrender now. Save yourselves the embarrassment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne's projection moved, throwing a punch straight at Tristram's projection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristram's projection let out a cold snort and swiftly countered, and his fist met Osborne's with a thunderous clash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though both were merely projections of divine power, the force of their collision was terrifying, like a deafening thunderclap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the stunned silence of the crowd, Tristram's projection shattered under the impact of Osborne's punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pathetic." Osborne's icy voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His projection now loomed over the gathered geniuses of the various races, and his expression dripped with disdain.</span></p><div class="pagination">
