  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahem. You wanted to ask him questions? Well, it might be too late for that. He's already dead," </span><span>Isa</span><span> said, rubbing her nose with an embarrassed look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback. "Dead? How did he die? Did you experiment on him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa</span><span> pouted, sounding slightly irritated. "Yeah, elemental metahumans are so fragile, like glass. I barely even started, and he already kicked the bucket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Another day with no results, I suppose."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you supposed to be a top-notch doctor? Couldn't you have done something to save him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa</span><span> shrugged. "He was shattered into pieces. Not even God could have saved him, let alone me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shattered into pieces?!" Osborne's eyes widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now he understood why </span><span>Isa</span><span> had earned the nickname "Grim Reaper".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Milo had lasted two days under her care, but Pamela, who was supposed to be stronger, barely made it a day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, now intensely curious, couldn't help but ask, "</span><span>Dr. Bowin</span><span>, can I ask what exactly you're experimenting with? It wouldn't be one of those wicked human trials, would it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa</span><span> gave him a nonchalant look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know what you're thinking, but the experiments I conduct are for the future of humanity. They're dangerous, sure, but they're not cruel or evil."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a sigh of relief at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If </span><span>Isa</span><span> were conducting malevolent experiments, he'd have to reconsider how to deal with her because he couldn't accept that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, </span><span>Isa</span><span> had denied it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Osborne asked, "Can you tell me more about what you're actually doing? How does it relate to the future of humanity?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa</span><span> hesitated for a moment before saying, "I'm searching for something - more specifically, a lock hidden within metahuman bodies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A lock?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was confused, thinking, "How could there be a lock inside a person's body?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And what does that have to do with humanity's future?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa</span><span> said, her tone serious, "It's not a regular lock; it's a genetic lock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you ever wondered why some people have powers while most don't?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh, isn't that just a matter of probability?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa</span><span> shook her head. "I don't think so. I believe everyone's body is the same and that everyone has the potential for powers. The key difference is this genetic lock. Some people accidentally unlock it, gaining powers in the process."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne asked, surprised, "Unlocking a genetic lock to gain powers?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't powers just a product of genetic mutations?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa</span><span> nodded. "Most people think that way. They don't believe in genetic locks, only mutations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I'm convinced the genetic lock does exist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The human body is a treasure trove of power, but it's locked away. If I can find this lock, I can unlock the true secrets of metahumans. I can make every ordinary person become a powerful metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Imagine a world where billions of people have powers, where everyone can control the forces of nature and wield god-like powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The planet would no longer confine humanity. We'd venture into deep space and conquer vast new worlds."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa</span><span>'s eyes lit up with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mouth hung open in shock. He thought, "I never imagined </span><span>Isa</span><span>'s research was aimed at this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her goal is to make everyone in the world like gods, wielding extraordinary powers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa</span><span> tilted her head, studying him. "You think I can't do it? You think I'm just wasting my time? You don't support me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Snapping back to reality, Osborne shook his head. "I think it's definitely a tough challenge, but as long as you keep at it, there's hope. So, yes, I support you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa</span><span>'s eyes lit up with excitement again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, nodding, "Really. No matter how wild or unrealistic your ideas might be, you're my friend. I've got your back. If you need help, just ask, and I'll be there for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke with genuine sincerity, making </span><span>Isa</span><span> momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her beautiful eyes welled up with tears as she looked down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said softly, "You know? You're the first person to support me so unconditionally. Even Godfather... he thinks I'm just wasting my time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, </span><span>Isa</span><span> lifted her gaze, her eyes gleaming with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm really glad Godfather put me with you. If I need help, I'll definitely turn to you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for trusting me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without warning, </span><span>Isa</span><span> stepped forward and enveloped Osborne in a hug before he could react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood on tiptoe and pressed a quick kiss to his cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is your reward."</span></p><div class="pagination">
