  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Zorro announcing the end of the match, Clara smoothly advanced to the top ten.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The quasi-Sacred Artifact Chain entwining Mason was retrieved by Clara. The moment it returned to her hand, it had already shattered into pieces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It broke!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Clara and Mason's strength, the quasi-Sacred Artifact truly couldn't withstand their power. If Mason were a bit stronger, this quasi-Sacred Artifact Chain might have shattered long ago.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, there are no ifs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Besides, even if the quasi-Sacred Artifact Chain shattered, Mason still had no chance of winning. At most, he would just avoid being humiliated so badly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Clara didn't even glance at Mason and slowly walked off the stage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The spectators began whispering among themselves at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This Clara is no ordinary person. No wonder she could defeat Princess Yvonne. She actually used a quasi-Sacred Artifact to defeat Mason, who ranks tenth on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I previously thought Princess Yvonne lost to Clara because she underestimated her strength. Princess Yvonne indeed underestimated Clara's abilities!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But now it seems Clara truly has strength!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Her entry into the top ten is well-deserved! As for Mason, he's somewhat overrated! Before the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel began, he was hailed as the strongest among ordinary contestants. Yet, his performance in the arena was truly disappointing!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He was first defeated in one move by Princess Seraphina barehanded, and then beaten by Clara with a very weak quasi-Sacred Artifact. It's simply too embarrassing!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah! If I were him, I'd want to crawl into a hole right now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He bragged too much before the match, but ended up getting beaten badly in the arena!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What a joke."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mason listened to these discussions, his face completely pale. Before the match, he had thought about making his name known throughout the entire Glorious Divine Kingdom, ensuring all the big figures in the country remembered him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, he did it!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in a different way. Not because he was brilliant, but because he was remembered for his disgrace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This feeling was more painful than being sliced piece by piece.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He clenched his fists and walked off the stage like a lifeless shell.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the audience's discussions about him quickly stopped.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because another spotlight battle was about to begin.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy versus Yvonne!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Leroy is probably the weakest among all the group leaders! After all, she drew the tenth group, the only group without any princes or princesses!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although she performed very strongly in the group melee, her opponents were just too weak! The highest-ranked was only 17th in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, and another was 25th!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She is definitely the weakest group leader!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And Princess Yvonne is definitely the strongest second in the group! Now, the strongest group second is up against the weakest group leader. This battle just got interesting!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Princess Yvonne is, after all, a member of the Royal Family. Her previous loss to Clara was just an accident. She will definitely defeat Leroy and make it into the top ten!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's right, if the princes and princesses of the Royal Family participate in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel and can't even make it into the top ten, it would be too embarrassing! The entire Royal Family would feel disgraced!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just wait and see. Princess Yvonne is really angry now, so she'll definitely defeat Leroy directly! Leroy is truly unlucky to go up against Princess Yvonne!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Princess Yvonne will regain the dignity she lost before!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd was discussing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy and Yvonne slowly stepped onto the stage. From a distance, they looked at each other.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy appeared calm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne's face, however, was full of coldness and anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wanted to prove her strength!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She wanted to reclaim the glory of the Royal Family that she had personally discarded!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All she needed to do was defeat Leroy and secure her spot in the top ten!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had confidence in herself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew very well that losing to Clara wasn't because she underestimated Clara's strength. If she fought Clara again, she would most likely lose again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she felt it was only because Clara's Legendary Sacred Artifact Chain was too powerful. It had an incredibly strong suppressive effect&mdash;once entangled, no one could break free.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne believed she only lost to Clara's Legendary Sacred Artifact Chain, not to Clara's strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Leroy couldn't possibly have a Legendary Sacred Artifact Chain like that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Yvonne believed she was bound to win!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Yvonne calmed down and said coldly, "I heard you're friends with Clara? You advanced together from Tempest Fortress City's city duel, Zephyr State's state duel, and Eastern Zone 3's zone duel?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy nodded calmly. "That's right! We're not just friends, but also rivals."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne sneered, "Perfect! Then I'll defeat you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let the battle begin!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Yvonne took out her intimidating Legendary Sacred Artifact Sword. At the same time, a Legendary Sacred Artifact Bell floated in front of her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These are her most commonly used offensive Legendary Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once activated, the bell can unleash an extremely powerful Soul Attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Last time she faced Clara, she was too confident and only used the Legendary Sacred Artifact Sword at first. By the time she realized something was wrong and took out the Legendary Sacred Artifact Bell, it was already too late. Before she could activate it, she was already entangled by Clara's Legendary Sacred Artifact Chain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So this time, Yvonne was more serious. She took out both Legendary Sacred Artifacts right from the start.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Take out your weapon!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't use that Inferior Sacred Artifact Spear. I know you definitely have a more powerful weapon!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time her opponent was Yvonne. Leroy naturally wouldn't be complacent and use only an Inferior Sacred Artifact. So she also took out the Legendary Sacred Artifact Spear given to her by Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This spear had a more exaggerated and ferocious design, emitting terrifying waves of power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne immediately narrowed her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sure enough, you also have a Legendary Sacred Artifact. Like Clara, you can wield a Legendary Sacred Artifact! However, you're not her after all! Her Legendary Sacred Artifact Chain can suppress my power, but your spear can't!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You&rsquo;re bound to lose!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Yvonne unleashed a surge of power around her. Her Legendary Sacred Artifacts glowed, ready to strike at any moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a voice echoed in her mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yvonne, you can't lose again! Otherwise, you'll disgrace the Royal Family's honor! Both your father and I will feel ashamed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, you must win at all costs!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Otherwise, I won't even know how to defend you! You'll just have to face the Royal Family's punishment and your father's wrath."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This voice made Yvonne tremble instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because this was Callista's voice. Callista demanded Yvonne win at all costs! Otherwise, Yvonne would face the Royal Family's punishment and her father's wrath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Yvonne even more serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Callista on the spectator's platform. Callista was all smiles, as if the words conveyed through Telepathy earlier hadn't come from her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne bit her lip.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I will never lose again! I will never let the Royal Family's honor be tarnished again!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Murmuring those words, Yvonne burned with fighting spirit and coldly stared at Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fight!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
