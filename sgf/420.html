  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body was unable to move, and he could only watch Chris approach him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with such a situation, all of his skills were ineffective because the gap was too big.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena, Bruce, and Chris were not ordinary Class A masters because their strength exceeded this level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People like them were like gods to ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena, who was far away, was still attacking Bruce frantically, wanting to get rid of Bruce and save Osborne. But unfortunately, she couldn't do that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was entangled by Bruce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne being caught by Chris, Serena showed a pale face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Serena and Osborne thought this in their minds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris finally grabbed Osborne's shoulder. His palm was like a clamp, and Osborne had no way to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, an accident occurred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying undercurrent suddenly appeared in front of Chris. Before Chris could react, he was hit by the undercurrent and flew out with a bang. He rolled on the seabed for a long time before finally stopping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, who was caught by him, escaped at this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris' expression was ugly, and he shouted, "Who dares to sneak attack me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who do you think you are? Why don't I dare to attack you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A domineering voice rang out, and then a burly man with a naked upper body and muscular body appeared beside Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at the man who saved him with a look of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know this person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his eyes were attracted by the huge harpoon in the man's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This harpoon was huge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris' Death Sickle was already huge, as tall as two adults, but this man's harpoon was twice as big as Chris' Death Sickle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top of the harpoon was divided into three sharp blades, from which emanated a terrifying wave of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris also looked at the man in surprise, attracted by the huge harpoon in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he exclaimed in surprise, "Poseidon's Trident!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What you hold in your hand is the legendary ancient weapon, the trident of God of the Sea. You are the pirate leader of Likreia Mountain, Bryce Clarkson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing these words, Osborne was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was this man Bryce, the leader of Likreia Mountain Pirates, the largest pirate group in this sea area?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he Kendra's brother?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "Why did he come here? Why did he save me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce smiled and said to Chris, "You are right."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he no longer paid attention to Chris, who had an ugly expression on his face but turned to look at Osborne unscrupulously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brat, someone asked me to help you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are too arrogant. Do you think you can interfere in such a battle? If I hadn't shown up in time, you would have been doomed. I don't know why that person cares about you so much and asked me to protect you in person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Clarkson, who asked you to protect me? Your sister Kendra?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do you know my sister Kendra? She lost her temper and ran out to play. Even I couldn't find her. Do you know where she is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was Kendra really Bryce's sister?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From what Bryce said, the person who asked Bryce to protect him was not Kendra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then who could that be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, a beautiful figure appeared in Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra once said that her brother Bryce admired Night Witch very much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Night Witch was Isa's code name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne smiled bitterly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "I asked Isa to help me, but she refused. She said that a strong man doesn't ask for help from others and told me not to rely on her but on myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now, she secretly asked Bryce to protect me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt moved in his heart. He wanted to press Isa against the wall and give her a kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This arrogant woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now was not the time to think about these things. Osborne said to Bryce, "Mr. Clarkson, let's not talk about your sister first. She is safe now. Can you please help to save Ms. Hernandez and kill these two people?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Osborne's words, Bryce shrugged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That person just asked me to protect you. She didn't ask me to help you kill people. If you want to kill them, do it yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was indeed Isa's style.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce was unwilling to help him, and Osborne had no choice. Fortunately, with Bryce here, Chris and Bruce had stopped and stood in the distance with grim expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris said coldly, "Bryce, this is a war between the Aberrants and the Draco Group. Do you want to intervene? Aren't you afraid of being killed by the King of the Aberrants?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Bryce heard these words, his face instantly turned cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said angrily, "The King of the Aberrants? Do you want to scare me? I am not afraid of him. Even if he is the king, he is not the king of this sea area. In this sea area, I am the king!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"On the shore, I can't defeat the King of the Aberrants, but on the sea, does he dare to fight with me? Even if I can't kill him, I'll make him seriously injured."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Bryce waved the huge trident in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, terrifying undercurrents hit Chris and Bruce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of them spat out blood.</span></p><div class="pagination">
