  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha hadn't laid a finger on Benson during their fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after she left, he managed to snap out of the effects of the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson didn't mope around about his defeat for long, because he knew it was a lost cause from the start.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Agatha was the number-one ranked fighter, and he was just fourth. Losing to the top dog wasn't exactly a stain on his record.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only thing that smarted was how badly he got trounced. He hadn't even given Agatha a hard time before getting overwhelmed by the power of her flute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that sting faded fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Broderick hasn't fared any better against Agatha. Agatha's taken Broderick down in less than a minute without even breaking a sweat. It seems Broderick is no tougher a nut to crack than I am.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Getting beat by Agatha was par for the course. But I ain't gonna throw in the towel. A little setback doesn't mean squat; we've got our whole futures ahead of us. One day, I'll be stronger than Agatha!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He balled his fists, his eyes alight with determination.</span><br><span>Now I gotta hold onto my spot on the leaderboard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, Benson took off running towards Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that if he could take out Osborne, Clara, and Leroy, whose combined scores were nearing 20 million, he'd bump his own points up to eight million. That'd give him a leg up in the race for the top rankings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, it wasn't long before Benson tracked down Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Along the way, he noticed that Osborne's points had skyrocketed by over a million. It seemed that Osborne had taken down Conrad, ranked fifteenth on the power list, and Lincoln, ranked eighth, one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that didn't make Benson change his game plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he came face-to-face with Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he looked at Conrad's team, lying unconscious not far away, and Lincoln in the same state, Benson's expression turned a bit more serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said in a dead-serious tone, "Y'all are something else!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Zephyr State officials must've dropped the ball big time putting you guys around the hundredth spot. Taking down both Conrad and Lincoln as a team? That's enough to make me sit up and take notice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne cocked an eyebrow at Benson's assumption.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He found it amusing that Benson thought they had to band together to beat Conrad and Lincoln.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, the fourth-ranked Benson? You do seem like a force to be reckoned with. I'll give you that&mdash;you've piqued my interest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson looked thoroughly confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get this show on the road!" Osborne didn't mince words. He tightened his grip on the Bloodwrought Bow and motioned for Benson to make his move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson said, "What're you getting at? You wanna go one-on-one with me? That's a dumb move! The only two who could take me on solo are Agatha and maybe Horace! Even Broderick wouldn't stand a snowball's chance in hell against me in a fair fight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All three of you, come at me together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne just grinned. "Funny you should say that. Now, you'll have to add another name to your list of solo challengers. I took down Conrad and Lincoln all on my own. So, whenever you're ready, come at me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson's eyes widened a fraction before he nodded, conceding the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I underestimated you. I thought your whole team took down Conrad and Lincoln. Guess I gotta give you some props. But don't get it twisted&mdash;you don't have a prayer of beating me. I'm no pushover like Conrad or Lincoln. You'll remember my name&mdash;I'm Benson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A rush of self-assurance coursed through him as he proclaimed, "The Resurgent Throne Palace isn't just about Agatha. You'll be hearing the name Benson real soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that proclamation, he sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying Sacred Power welled up from within him, unleashing a searing wave of fiery energy, much like an impending volcanic eruption.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his right hand, Benson grasped a colossal Sacred Artifact sword, and in his left, he brandished a hefty Sacred Artifact shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson swung his Sacred Artifact sword, and flames exploded around it, forming a tempestuous wave of sword energy that hurtled towards Osborne like a raging tidal wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was ablaze, and the sword energy sliced through the atmosphere with a fearsome intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could feel the raw power emanating from Benson. It was a far cry from the might of Conrad and Lincoln, who had only fused two powers, while Benson had mastered three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a clear chasm in the tier of their Sacred Powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing Benson's fiery onslaught, Osborne knew he couldn't afford to take this lightly. He unleashed his own Sacred Power, and in an instant, Sacred Power Arrow arrows materialized and shot forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrows crashed into the fiery sword's energy and shattered, triggering a massive explosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the two attacks clashed, it ended in a deadlock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was precisely what Osborne had expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, a look of unease flashed across Benson's face. From Osborne's seemingly nonchalant arrow, he felt a terrifying might that was either on par with or even exceeded his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, Benson was left gobsmacked. He never thought Osborne could also fuse three powers, putting them on an equal playing field.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was no time for jaw-jacking now. He had to treat Osborne as a formidable foe and bring out his A-game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson roared, his voice laced with determination, "Can't take down Agatha? Well, I'm sure as hell gonna beat you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am gonna win this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Benson's power spiked, Osborne upped his ante too. He remembered how easily Benson had been defeated by Agatha, which meant she was a cut above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wanted to push Benson to his limits to get a better read on Agatha's true strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After knowing Agatha trounced Horace, Osborne knew that his only real competition was her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson, Broderick, and Horace were just warm-up acts for the main event.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sacred Power arrows rained down ceaselessly, clashing head-on with Benson's fiery sword energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every collision sparked a dazzling explosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the surface, it seemed like a fair fight, but only Benson knew the bitter truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how hard he let loose with his power, Osborne's arrows always had a slight upper hand, smashing through his fiery attacks like they were made of paper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This situation was a real pain in the neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike his quick defeat at Agatha's hands, Benson now felt completely hemmed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's unrelenting onslaught was like a spider's web, trapping him no matter how much he thrashed around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every attempt to break free seemed like a wild-goose chase, and all he could do was pray that Osborne would run out of steam and show a chink in his armor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But deep down, he knew that was just wishful thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, back in Frost Peak City, the crowd was still in a daze from Agatha's effortless thrashing of Horace when they shifted their focus to the showdown between Benson and Osborne. Immediately, they all craned their necks with curiosity, looking in that direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela and Danilo were also watching the projected scene with bated breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela yelped, "Osborne's going up against Benson!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Benson's ranked fourth! He's in the same league as Broderick, just a step below Horace! He's definitely one of the top dogs just shy of the Empyrean Sacredness. If he'd taken part in previous state duels, he'd have walked away with the trophy easy-peasy..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela looked worried as all get-out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How long can Osborne last against Benson? Can he work another miracle, just like he did with Conrad and Lincoln?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head, and the doubt was written all over her face.</span><br><span>There's no way Osborne can beat Benson. That's just pie in the sky!</span></p><div class="pagination">
