  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone turned their heads and saw Rodney slowly approaching them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tony immediately scoffed. "Rodney, are you here to watch us fail?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney gave a calm smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, I'm here to propose a deal."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tony frowned, his face filled with suspicion. "A deal? We're competitors. What kind of deal could we possibly have to discuss?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney looked at him disdainfully. "Are you sure you're my competition? Let's be honest&mdash;you've already been eliminated. Even if you hadn't been, did you ever stand a chance of claiming the Heir's Emblem and becoming the heir?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tony and the other three men looked furious, but none could refute his words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We may have lost, but you have no chance either! It's obvious that the branch bloodlines from Yalynch, Marcelin, and Ransford have teamed up. They're already strong individually, and now that they've formed an alliance, they're planning to monopolize both the Heir's Emblems. You won't stand a chance."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney nodded with a smile. "You're not wrong. If nothing unexpected happens, I would have no chance either. But the unexpected has already happened, hasn't it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne is that unexpected factor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He eliminated all four of you right from the start, shattering your hopes. That gives us a basis for cooperation."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tony and the others looked uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What kind of cooperation are you proposing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's very simple. Lend me your men to help me seize the Heir's Emblem, and I'll make sure you're handsomely rewarded."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tony looked surprised. "Lend you our men?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's right!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney's voice was steady. "Even though you four have been eliminated, together, your branch bloodlines still have forty strong men. Add that to the eighteen from my branch in the Norlend, and I'll have a formidable team of fifty-eight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"With so many helpers, I'm confident I can wrest the Heir's Emblem from Osborne's hands and fend off Sam and David."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In the end, you'll benefit, I'll become the heir, and we'll all be pleased."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The four men exchanged glances, intrigued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What kind of reward are we talking about?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing that they were interested, Rodney leaned in and whispered a few words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their eyes immediately lit up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright! We agree. We'll lend you our men, but you have to keep your promise and help us get revenge. Osborne must be thoroughly humiliated!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The four men gritted their teeth, filled with resentment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney, seeing their agreement, laughed. "Don't worry, I won't let you down. Osborne won't get away this time, even with his spatial power. He won't escape!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just wait and see."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Rodney left, and the four men quickly ordered their people to follow him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney's forces swelled to nearly sixty men, making him the contender with the most helpers in the entire Branch Bloodline Competition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, at the Challenge Peak, the crowd watching from Platform Two erupted in disbelief at what they saw on the screen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the screen, Osborne had suddenly launched a sneak attack from the ground, knocking out Tony, Kent, Henry, and John with just two moves, eliminating them instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How dare he!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I get it now. He stayed behind to launch a sneak attack and take out some competitors to ease his pressure!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He actually has spatial power!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And he managed to escape!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this point, Kent's families and Tony's families were shouting in frustration and anger. Their chosen heirs had been eliminated, and they wanted nothing more than to tear Osborne apart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But they couldn't do that, so they turned their fury on Isaac, Nathan, and the others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Asshole, A sneak attack, really? How shameless!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If he had the guts to fight Osborne fairly, Osborne would have beaten him into a pulp!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Despicable, shameless, sneaking up on people like that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Have some dignity!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The supporters of the four branch bloodlines began cursing wildly at Isaac, Nathan, and the others, venting their frustration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nathan, quick-tempered as always, shouted back. "What do you mean despicable? Caleb clearly said at the start that any tactic was allowed in this Branch Bloodline Competition. Of course, sneaking attacks are fair game! Your heirs were just too weak and got eliminated. How dare you blame others?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're all just trash, worthless!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nathan seized the opportunity to hurl insults, enraging the supporters even further. If the rules didn't forbid it, they would have beaten Nathan to a pulp by now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just wait. That scum Osborne won't get away with this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"His trump card, spatial power, has already been exposed. He won't last long! Sam, David, and Rodney will make sure of that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just you wait!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The insults finally ceased, and everyone focused back on the screen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they saw Rodney striking a deal with the four men, the crowd erupted again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isaac, Nathan, and the others looked worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn it! They're the shameless ones, teaming up to take down Osborne! He's all alone, and they have nearly sixty people. How's that fair?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How is he supposed to win?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nathan's face was filled with concern, even despair. Osborne's sneak attack had only taken out four competitors, but he was now up against nearly a hundred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How was he supposed to stand a chance?</p><div class="pagination">
