  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Cain&rsquo;s Blood Cross, an ancient artifact with unimaginable powers. Those who possess it can consume others&rsquo; blood to enhance their own strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It is said to have abilities like imprisoning souls, converting vampires, shielding from metahuman attacks, and storing metahuman powers. A century ago, it appeared in Rosmandi and was suspected to have been obtained by the Aberrants, after which it vanished without a trace.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne took a sharp breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;An ancient artifact?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His expression turned serious. The world had such bizarre items? But considering the existence of metahuman and martial artists, Osborne wasn&rsquo;t entirely surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The world was vast, and strange things could exist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Could the item Paul has be Cain&rsquo;s Blood Cross? It seems likely. Unfortunately, even the Godfather&rsquo;s intelligence network doesn&rsquo;t have a picture of the Blood Cross.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;However, Isa told me that the group attacking Clarissa was the Aberrants. Paul could very well be a spy for them, and the Blood Cross was supposedly acquired by the Aberrants a century ago. This might not be a coincidence. I need to investigate this quickly.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His third heir test had a deadline of only seven days, leaving no time to waste. He had to expose Paul&rsquo;s true identity as soon as possible to replace him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne calmed himself and returned to the fourth bodyguard unit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Clarissa&rsquo;s consecutive attacks, the entire Radcliffe family was on edge. The bodyguards&rsquo; rest time was significantly reduced, with the four units divided into two shifts to protect Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne had to work twelve hours before he could rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Fortunately, no accidents happened that day. By 9 PM, the third bodyguard unit arrived to take over, allowing the fourth to rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Osborne, want to grab a drink? Let&rsquo;s celebrate your joining the fourth Unit,&rdquo; Violet, the deputy captain, suggested with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne hesitated. He planned to find Davy to uncover the connection between Paul and him, hoping to find evidence of Paul being a spy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Sorry, Ms. Smith, I have something urgent today. Can I treat you all another day?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Alright, if you have something urgent, go ahead,&rdquo; Violet replied, smiling and not insisting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne left the Radcliffe Manor and drove to the north side of Mayby City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Davy was the leader of the Maelstrom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Maelstrom&rsquo;s headquarters was in an underground boxing club in the northern part of the city.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Maelstrom Boxing Club.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne parked his car a hundred meters from the Maelstrom Boxing Club and didn&rsquo;t rush in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Several brawny men with black snake tattoos on their arms were smoking and chatting at the entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This represented their identity as members of the Maelstrom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When guests approached, they would conduct body searches. Weapons, phones, and any recording devices were not allowed inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clearly, the fight club&rsquo;s business was not legitimate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne activated the Satan&rsquo;s Eye to see if Davy was inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Unfortunately, the boxing club was too complex for the Eye&rsquo;s current capabilities. He would have to go inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne waited patiently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had already bought some necessary items through the Draco Star Wristlet, which should arrive soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon, a young man wearing a hat appeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He walked to Osborne&rsquo;s car, opened the back door, quickly placed a box inside, and left without a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne smiled and opened the box.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Inside were several items arranged neatly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A human skin mask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A button.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Two medicine bottles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne picked up the mask and slipped it onto his face, instantly transforming into a middle-aged man without any flaws.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;As expected from the technology of the Draco Group. This human skin mask is completely convincing. Even those who know me well wouldn&rsquo;t recognize me. It&rsquo;s worth the million dollars I spent.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne admired the mask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Next, he picked up the button.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was actually a mini camera that split into two parts, one for recording and eavesdropping, and the other to be placed in the ear for listening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne tested the device and then clipped it to his lapel, where it was completely inconspicuous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Finally, he examined the two medicine bottles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I wonder if these two medicines are as miraculous as advertised. They cost me five million dollars. If they don&rsquo;t work, I&rsquo;ll be at a huge loss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope they work.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Murmuring to himself, Osborne pushed open his car door and walked towards the Maelstrom Boxing Club.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Stop. New face?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At the club&rsquo;s entrance, several Maelstrom thugs blocked Osborne and signaled for a body search.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne raised his hands, cooperating fully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had already prepared, leaving his phone and weapons in the car, ensuring nothing incriminating would be found.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After the search, the thugs stepped aside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Go ahead. Enjoy yourself. But remember, don&rsquo;t cause any trouble on Maelstrom turf, or you&rsquo;ll disappear forever.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne smiled faintly and walked into the club.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Instantly, the loud shouts and screams filled his ears.</p><div class="pagination">
