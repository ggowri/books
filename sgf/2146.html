  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been twenty-five days since Osborne entered Umbra Earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he wanted to, he could have continued exploring for at least another five days, but he had made up his mind to head back to Celestara immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His discoveries during this expedition had been nothing short of monumental&mdash;over three thousand Element Gold Crystals, more than fifty thousand Sacred Crystals, over two thousand Azure Ores, </span><span>over </span><span>four thousand Radiant Golden Ores, a Sublime Concealment Orb, and the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If others were to learn of these treasures, they would surely go mad with envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While there were undoubtedly more riches hidden within Umbra Earth&mdash;like various Sacred Elixirs, the Soul of Umbra Earth that could elevate his Infinite Sacred Body, and countless rare materials&mdash;Osborne felt it was time to stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Greed can be a dangerous thing," he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His haul was likely greater than what everyone else combined had managed to gather, making it unnecessary to linger any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Osborne had only been in Umbra Earth for twenty-five days, he had been away from Celestara for nearly a month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had set that as his deadline, and he worried that the situation back home might have changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a chance that the Paramount Supreme Clan had engaged in a full-scale war with the Human Community of the West Zone. Such a conflict could lead to the loss of billions of warriors, and every moment counted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "I need to get back and put an end to this war in Celestara."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne then commanded, "Let's get moving!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ascending Sacred Sanctum, shrink down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ascending Sacred Sanctum was enormous&mdash;at least a hundred times larger than the God of Light's Sanctum of Light, comparable to a massive city fortress that could easily accommodate tens of millions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as Osborne's command resonated through the air, the vast structure began to contract rapidly, eventually reducing to a size of just about a hundred yards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's much more pleasing to the eye!" Osborne remarked, relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before it shrank, anyone who caught sight of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum would immediately recognize it as a Sacred Artifact-level palace. Now, however, it looked no different from an ordinary divine artifact-level palace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sacred Artifact-level palaces were incredibly precious; their appearances often sparked fierce battles, with countless Empyrean Sacredness warriors vying to seize them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the Ascending Sacred Sanctum was damaged, it still held more value than an average divine artifact-level palace, especially for the peak Supernal Deity Kings and Empyrean Sacredness warriors&mdash;it was a tantalizing prize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the main structure of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum remained relatively intact, leaving room for future restoration. A fully restored Ascending Sacred Sanctum would surpass any typical Sacred Artifact-level palace in strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne pondered this, a thought struck him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Grimoire of Sacred Artifact Forging Chuck gave me can create a Sacred Artifact from scratch! Repairing a Sacred Artifact is far easier than forging a new one. Perhaps one day, I could personally restore the Ascending Sacred Sanctum... but I'll need a lot of rare materials for that. I'm not ready yet, but it's definitely something to consider for the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his mind racing with possibilities, Osborne surveyed his surroundings one last time before preparing to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, his expression changed, a look of surprise crossing his face. "What is that?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ascending Sacred Sanctum had crashed into the Umbra Earth long ago, creating a massive pit, and had remained stationary ever since.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as it was being maneuvered by Osborne, the depths of that pit came into view, revealing something unexpected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Osborne saw it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There lay an enormous skeleton radiating a soft, white glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he focused on it, he felt a faint pulse of Sacred Power emanating from the bones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sacred Power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at the skeleton, utterly astonished. He had encountered countless bones in the Skeletal Wasteland, but those had long since lost their divine essence, reduced to mere remnants of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This skeleton, however, was not only colossal but still retained traces of Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the skeletal remains of an Empyrean Sacredness being!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after thousands of years of erosion, the bones still pulsed with Sacred Power, making them incredibly resilient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In many ways, they could be considered a rare and valuable material&mdash;potentially even usable for forging a Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unbelievable! It's the skeleton of an Empyrean Sacredness being!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart raced with excitement. He hadn't anticipated discovering such a well-preserved relic beneath the Ascending Sacred Sanctum. With this skeleton, he would have a substantial resource for restoring the Sanctum in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems this Empyrean Sacredness being was killed by the impact of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A vivid image flashed through Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He envisioned a towering figure, powerful and majestic, controlling the Ascending Sacred Sanctum as it battled against countless colossal foes. The figure was gravely injured, and even the formidable Sanctum was battered and on the brink of losing its might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a desperate move, that powerful being hurled the Sanctum against an Empyrean Sacredness enemy, sending both crashing deep into the Umbra Earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tremendous force of the collision had not only slain the Empyrean Sacredness being but also shattered the Umbra Earth into countless fragments that scattered in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of those fragments, by sheer chance, penetrated the barrier of the Umbra World and drifted into deep space, eventually discovered by Elf City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was precisely where Osborne now stood on this piece of Umbra Earth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne exhaled sharply, the vision in his mind dissipating as quickly as it had come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to collect this Empyrean Sacredness skeleton!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Activating his Satan's Eye, he unleashed a surge of ocular energy that enveloped the massive skeleton. In an instant, it vanished from sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within the inner space of Satan's Eye, the pristine white skeleton materialized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced around again, searching for any other treasures he might have missed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Umbra Earth was a veritable goldmine; it seemed that just about anything he touched yielded precious finds that were hard to come by elsewhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the troubling situation back in Celestara, he would have loved to stay and explore further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sighed, disappointed, "Looks like there's nothing else here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad I didn't find the Soul of Umbra Earth! Maybe it doesn't even exist in this part of Umbra Earth..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne resolved to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He maneuvered the Ascending Sacred Sanctum down toward the ground, aiming for the third platform to use the Spatial Translocator. As he passed by the spot where Alfreda had fallen, he paused for a moment, lost in contemplation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimately, Osborne could only sigh and quickly make his exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, within Elf City, a furious roar erupted from the Ethereal Elven Temple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn human! I will find you!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
