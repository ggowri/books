  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne successfully redirected the conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah said, looking at him, "There's another big development, and it's about your family&mdash;the Swift family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression grew distant. "The Swift family? They're a thing of the past for me. I've been cast out; they've severed ties with me completely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah opened her mouth to retort but ultimately nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, this is about the Swift family. Three days ago, their head, Walter, celebrated a grand birthday bash, inviting many of the major powers in Wild Flame City. Aside from the three Upper Race factions, nearly every other clan sent representatives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After the party, Walter announced that he was stepping down as the head of the Swift family. The new leader is Calvin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "Is that really such a big deal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah shook her head, eager to explain, "Just wait!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calvin becoming the head of the Swift family is significant, but what he did next is even bigger. His first official act was to announce his engagement to Nydia Borden from the Fero Tiger Clan. And here's the kicker&mdash;Nydia will be his official wife, his first lady!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calvin is marrying Nydia from the Fero Tiger Clan? Didn't he already have a wife?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah pressed on. "He divorced his first wife!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And it gets even more interesting&mdash;Nydia isn't just any ordinary woman; she's the illegitimate daughter of Laird, a Deity Overlord-level warrior and the general of the City Guard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By marrying Nydia and giving her the title of first lady, Calvin is clearly trying to curry favor with the Fero Tiger Clan and Laird."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Laird..." Osborne murmured, recalling the imposing figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laird had intervened to stop Fabian from attacking him, and later, Laird had tried to recruit Osborne, offering him extensive training, which Osborne had turned down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remembered Laird's anger at his refusal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Calvin is aligning himself with Laird of the Fero Tiger Clan? They may not be one of the three Upper Races in Wild Flame City, but they're definitely a force to be reckoned with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But honestly, how does this affect me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this really such a big deal, or are you missing the main point?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's cheeks flushed at his directness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just wanted to lay the groundwork! Here's the main point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After announcing his engagement to Nydia, Calvin declared a second thing&mdash;this is </span><span>where you come in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He issued a... wanted notice against you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He claims you stole from the Swift family's treasury and has given you three days to return all the Essence Crystals and treasures. If you don't comply, he's threatening to take action against you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Meanwhile, the Borden family of the Fero Tiger Clan is also calling for you to return and return what you took!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah glanced at Osborne, worry etched on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes, a smirk creeping onto his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calvin is accusing me of stealing from the Swift family? He wants me to return everything in three days or face the consequences?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's laughable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like the Borden family is in on this too; they must have conspired to go after me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah </span><span>nodded,</span><span> her expression serious. "Lachlan, should I get the Gellar family involved? Just one word from them, and I guarantee neither the Borden family nor the Swift family would dare make a move against you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated, then shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need for that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can handle this myself; I don't want to trouble the Gellar family. But I really appreciate your offer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah hesitated for a moment but ultimately decided against pushing the issue further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's one last piece of significant news, and it's about Spark Estate. Just the day before yesterday, the Keynes family from the Crimson </span><span>Ironhoof</span><span> Clan teamed up with the Wolfe family from the Wild Bull Clan to launch an attack on Spark Estate. The Deity Overlord warriors Gilbert Keynes and Fabian nearly broke through the estate's divine power shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fortunately, Spark Estate's starlight shield is top-notch. After expending a considerable amount of Essence Crystals, it managed to withstand the onslaught from both Gilbert and Fabian, keeping the warriors of the Keynes and Wolfe families at bay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, they haven't given up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They've been relentlessly trying to breach Spark Estate over the past couple of days, declaring that they want you dead. That's why I rushed to find you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah looked intently at </span><span>Osborne,</span><span> concern etched on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan, maybe you should let the Gellar family step in. If you're willing, just a word from us could make the Keynes and Wolfe families think twice about targeting Spark Estate. It would definitely improve your situation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her words, Osborne's expression turned icy, a palpable aura of menace emanating from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Keynes and Wolfe families? Two Deity Overlord warriors? They really think highly of me, don't they?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
