  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half a day later, Osborne finally left Blood Demon Island and returned to Newport City, to the Augustine family's territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood Demon Island was where Training Base No. 1 was located.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne renamed the island Blood Demon Island and designated it the headquarters of the Blood Demon Organization. He planned to revamp the other nine training bases and turn them into reserve bases for the Blood Demon Organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally, everything is taken care of!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon returning to his room, Osborne spent three whole days meticulously arranging everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia was already receiving treatment at the Medical Research Institute, and Zoe had started her breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the Weapons Research Institute was working at full capacity to produce energy pistols, energy rifles, and energy sniper rifles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within a month, everyone in the Blood Demon Organization would be equipped with the most advanced energy weapons and possibly even energy armor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, everything was on the right track.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, there were only twenty-seven days left until his Honor Quest Ceremony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had to use these twenty-seven days to become stronger, aiming to reach at least Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "If I want to achieve multiple consecutive victories in the Honor Quest Ceremony, or even complete The Seventh Inheritance Trial and flawlessly conquer the Honor Quest Ceremony, fighting until no one dares challenge me anymore... I'm still far from that goal with my current strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides reaching Class AAA, I also need to master the power of a Realm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Palmers, a Class AA, had grasped the power of a Realm. Surely, many of the global geniuses coming to attend my Honor Quest Ceremony would have also mastered some form of Realm power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without the power of a Realm to counter them, the battles would be incredibly difficult!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, I must master the power of a Realm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression grew serious as he contemplated which type of Realm he was most likely to master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Realm was an advanced application of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Light Realm?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thunder Realm?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Domain?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spirit Realm?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dark Realm?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne listed the types of Realms he was most likely to master and immediately ruled out the Dark Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had felt the power of the Dark Realm firsthand when he fought Palmers. He knew how formidable it was. Had he not had a way to counter it, he might have died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne's control over dark power was too weak; he hadn't even mastered Intermediate Level applications.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was nearly impossible for him to master the Dark Realm in just twenty-seven days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he eliminated the Dark Realm first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "I should focus on breaking through with the Light Realm. My light elemental essence is exceptionally strong, and my control over it far exceeds my grasp of the other elemental essences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Light Realm is undoubtedly the easiest for me to master! But relying solely on the Light Realm might not be enough; it's too easily countered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Thunder Power, I've already mastered two Intermediate Level applications: Thunder Explosion and Thunder of Judgment! With some effort, I might be able to master the Thunder Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The same goes for Spatial Domain. I've already mastered two Intermediate Level applications of spatial power: Spatial Collapse and Spatial Prison. Especially with Spatial Prison... If I keep honing it, I'm sure I can master the Spatial Domain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the Spirit Realm, I only have exceptionally strong mental strength. Whether I can master the Spirit Realm will depend on luck."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After pondering his options, Osborne began his training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His main focus was to break through with Light Power, Thunder Power, and spatial power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he needed to pay attention to enhancing his Class level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He went to the top floor of the mansion, using ocular energy to capture vast amounts of star power, devouring it to strengthen his body and soul while also delving into the deeper applications of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two more days quickly passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That day, Caleb arrived, and with him came Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, Cuthbert's Honor Quest Ceremony is in two days! I've arranged suitable identities for both of you. With some simple disguises, you can set out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Caleb finished speaking, Osborne and Emma exchanged a glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excitement flickered in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your identities will be as young warriors from the Secluded Family, the Lambert family. Osborne, you'll go by the name Axell Lambert, and Emma, you'll be Maia Lambert. You'll be traveling to Tethynia with elders from the Lambert family and several other young warriors to attend Cuthbert's Honor Quest Ceremony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Lambert family has always been on friendly terms with our Augustine family. We can completely trust them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Caleb's words, Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Lambert family? A Secluded Family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Caleb, what is a Secluded Family? Has the Lambert family also received an invitation from the Williamson family? Is the Lambert family a superpower too? How do they compare to our Augustine family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb's expression turned somewhat peculiar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, the Lambert family is a superpower! But unlike other superpowers, the Lambert family doesn't care about fame and power. They've always led a secluded life, with their sole pursuit being the quest for greater strength!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
