  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After spending a few days on Necoton Planet, Osborne finally stepped onto the Cosmic Translocator bound for Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their destination? The Glorious Divine Kingdom, one of the three Top-tier Powers on Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three dominant forces&mdash;Glorious Divine Kingdom, Evernight Court, and Phantom Commerce Guild&mdash;controlled more than half of Racial Convergence Planet's territory combined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, the Phantom Commerce Guild had a relatively small domain, while the Evernight Court claimed about 30% of the planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Glorious Divine Kingdom, slightly weaker, occupied around 20%.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what did that 20% even look like?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne struggled to find the right words to describe it. The Glorious Divine Kingdom was divided into ten zones, each containing a hundred states, and each state had a hundred cities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the size of each city?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was no smaller than the entire Celestara Planet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were to estimate, the territory of the Glorious Divine Kingdom was roughly equivalent to a staggering one hundred thousand Celestara Planets!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, the Glorious Divine Kingdom was vast&mdash;so vast that even a regular Supernal Deity King would take years to fly from the southern tip to the northern edge of the empire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, every city within the kingdom had its own Cosmic Translocator, allowing anyone with enough Celestial Crystals to travel freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, countless factions, both large and small, existed within the territory of the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mystic Sirius Sect was one of these Second-rate powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overall, the forces on Racial Convergence Planet could be categorized into five tiers&mdash;Top-tier Power, First-rate Power, Second-rate Power, Third-rate Power, and Piddling Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top three powers were the Evernight Court, Glorious Divine Kingdom, and Phantom Commerce Guild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These three held supreme status, and no other factions dared to challenge them or offend them; they could only exist under the trio's shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were dozens of First-rate Powers on Racial Convergence Planet&mdash;at most, a hundred&mdash;each one incredibly strong, boasting numerous Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, there were many more Second-rate Powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mystic Sirius Sect, for instance, had elders, leaders, and elite disciples who were all Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were practically countless Third-rate Powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a faction to be considered a Third-rate Power, it had to have at least one Empyrean Sacredness warrior. Without one, they didn't even make the cut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Glorious Divine Kingdom, there were more than twenty First-rate Powers and hundreds of Second-rate Powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of these factions had to pay resources to the Glorious Divine Kingdom every year, and in return, they got a certain level of protection from it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mystic Sirius Sect was in Eastern Zone 3 of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, close to Tempest Fortress City, which was one of the three Second-rate Powers in that area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a disorienting trip through the transporter, Osborne, along with Isa and Maddox, finally landed in the territory of the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they materialized on the huge Cosmic Translocator, they saw a bunch of people popping up around them, all wearing excited expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Racial Convergence Planet! I'm finally here!" someone shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha! Is this really Racial Convergence Planet? The energy here is amazing! The gravitational pull is so strong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at all these warriors!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could sense the awe in their voices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew these people had come from numerous medium-sized, small, and even tiny life planets in the vicinity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them was a top-notch talent on their own planets. However, once they reached a certain cultivation level, their home planets no longer had the resources to support their further advancement. To break through to higher cultivation levels, they had no choice but to come to the Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was precisely because of the continuous influx of talented individuals that the Racial Convergence Planet thrived and was filled with powerful warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, the gravity here is so much stronger than on Celestara Planet! I feel like my body is being crushed! It takes so much more effort to do anything!" Isa whispered to Osborne, her voice tinged with discomfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the three of them, Osborne was the only one who had lived on the Racial Convergence Planet in his previous life. Now that his memories had returned, he was very familiar with it. Maddox was also from the Racial Convergence Planet, but this was Isa's first time here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the intense gravity, Isa was having a hard time adjusting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave her a gentle smile. "You'll get used to it! The gravity here is indeed much stronger than on Celestara Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, the Racial Convergence Planet is a large life planet, while Celestara is just a small one. The difference is huge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"On the Racial Convergence Planet, no one below the Celestial Deity Level can fly for long! That should give you an idea of how strong the gravity is! But don't worry&mdash;you're already an Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King. This gravity won't stop you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's eyes popped open in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, are you telling me that anyone below the Celestial Deity Level can't fly properly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! Now, let's make our way to Tempest Fortress City in Eastern Zone 3. The Mystic Sirius Sect is a Second-rate Power, and it's a great place for us to grow right now. Besides, Maddox is an inner disciple there, so he can get us in without any entrance exams."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne turned to Maddox. "Lead the way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood!" Maddox replied, all fired up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't jump off the Cosmic Translocator just yet. Instead, Maddox had a quick chat with the attendant on duty, swapped some Celestial Crystals, and before long, the Cosmic Translocator started humming back to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they materialized again, they were in Eastern Zone 3, right in the heart of Tempest Fortress City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>True to its name, Tempest Fortress City was a place where storms were a constant presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The howling winds were so fierce that it was almost impossible to keep eyes open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne and his friends had to put up a divine power shield to feel at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Lord, should we go straight to the Mystic Sirius Sect?" Maddox asked, stealing a glance at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "First, let's get settled at the Mystic Sirius Sect and become their disciples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"On Racial Convergence Planet, if you don't have a proper identity, you'll be under scrutiny wherever you go. The Mystic Sirius Sect might be a Second-rate power, but having their backing will make things a whole lot easier for us down the road."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can trust me, my Lord. I'm just an inner disciple, but I'm ranked seventh. That means the higher-ups think highly of me. I've got a good shot at becoming a core disciple in the future!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can recommend both of you to join the Mystic Sirius Sect without any tests or identity checks. With your strength, you'll skip the outer-disciple stage and become inner disciples right off the bat. If you're willing to show what you can do, becoming core disciples will be a piece of cake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eventually, becoming high-ranking elders of the Mystic Sirius Sect is definitely doable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Maddox finished talking, he pointed in a certain direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment and then decided not to take out the Ascending Sacred Sanctum. Instead, he took out the Sanctum of Night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Racial Convergence Planet, where warriors were everywhere, and it was common to run into Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the Ascending Sacred Sanctum was damaged, it might still be recognized as a Sacred Artifact, and that would bring him all kinds of headaches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he made up his mind to use the Ascending Sacred Sanctum only when it was absolutely necessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sanctum of Night was also a top-notch Apex divine artifact, which should be good enough for their needs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, they arrived at the Mystic Sirius Sect by Sanctum of Night.</span></p><div class="pagination">
