  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. John Augustine!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you alright, Mr. John Augustine?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A group of people from the Clifford Augustine family rushed to John's side, their voices filled with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">John slowly regained consciousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His body ached all over, and it took him a moment to fully grasp the reality of his defeat&mdash;he had lost utterly, failing to even touch Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His face darkened with frustration and anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">John glared at Osborne, his eyes burning with resentment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had been overly confident in his Satan's Eye's Illusion Projection, believing it would surely disorient Osborne. Because of this, he hadn't bothered to dodge Osborne's attack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he had, he was certain the outcome would have been different.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">John still had many tricks up his sleeve that he hadn't had a chance to use, so he wasn't ready to accept this defeat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I refuse to accept this! I want a rematch&mdash;I wasn't ready just now!" John demanded angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne gave him a sidelong glance and replied coolly, "A rematch? That can be arranged, but if you lose again, you'll owe me another ten percent of your resources."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">John's expression hardened abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had already lost ten percent of the Clifford branch bloodline's resources. Another loss would be a significant blow. Even as an heir to the Clifford branch bloodline, explaining this to his family would be challenging.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, the thought of not fighting again left him restless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"John, just sit this one out. Let me handle him. Even if you want to fight again, you'll have to wait until I'm done," Henry said, his face set in a stern expression as he approached.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">John considered this and, after a moment, huffed in resignation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Henry, be careful. He's tricky. My Illusion Projection didn't affect him at all&mdash;his mental defenses are exceptionally strong."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Henry simply smiled, his gaze fixed intently on Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry. I'll be careful. And Osborne, I'm not John. I won't be careless. You won't find any chance to win against me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, a powerful aura emanated from Henry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Another Class A+ fighter!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Henry's power felt even denser than John's, though he still fell short of Class AA.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As long as Henry wasn't Class AA, Osborne remained unruffled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Calmly, Osborne remarked, "Is that so? I think fighting you might be even easier than fighting him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne then casually retrieved an energy pistol from his Dimensional Space.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He twirled it smoothly in his hand, a mocking smile on his face as he regarded Henry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Henry's face turned icy. "Osborne, are you out of your mind? Do you really think a toy like that will have any effect on someone at our level? Are you seriously planning to use that pathetic water gun against me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's smile remained cool and unfazed. "Water gun? Just so you know, it's not a water gun but a highly effective energy weapon. It should be more than enough to take you down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't say I didn't warn you if you let your guard down and end up getting shot."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ridiculous!" Henry's face flushed with anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He saw Osborne's words not as a warning but an insult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're clearly too arrogant. Let me teach you a lesson!" Henry roared, activating his Satan's Eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Five white star points gleamed, signaling that his Satan's Eye had reached level five.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ocular energy flickered around him, and Osborne felt a light mind control pressure on him. However, it didn't seem particularly strong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the next moment, orange level-two Devil's Light appeared around Henry, forming a protective shield.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Henry's fingers moved swiftly. It seemed that he was preparing some sort of devastating technique.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Five seconds had ticked by, and Henry's energy was raging uncontrollably, yet his ultimate move was still unprepared, his attack still on hold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's patience was wearing thin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What a waste of time!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Osborne raised his energy pistol, a pale yellow energy surging into it. He aimed directly at Henry's thigh and pulled the trigger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Henry didn't even flinch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He smirked. "A laughable toy like this? You think it can hurt me? Wait until I unleash my..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't get to finish his sentence before a blood-curdling scream tore from his throat. Osborne's energy pistol had effortlessly pierced his level two Devil's Light defense, the shot puncturing his thigh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A gaping blood hole appeared on his leg, blood spurting out in torrents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne didn't hesitate; he fired four more shots, each one targeting a different limb of Henry's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, all four limbs were riddled with holes, blood gushing everywhere. The power Henry had been building for so long shattered, and he was struck by a sudden backlash. His face went ashen, blood trickling from his mouth, clearly suffering from the recoil.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a thunderous crash, Henry collapsed, his eyes wide with shock and frustration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't fathom how a mere pistol could shatter his Devil's Light defense and penetrate his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It made no sense!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But no matter how unwilling he was, he had lost.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was already standing over him, his energy pistol pressed against Henry's head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a smile, Osborne said, "Henry, you've lost.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Time to face the music.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"From now on, one-tenth of the resources from both the Narciso's Augustine family and the Clifford's Augustine family will be redirected to the Dampston's Augustine family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's the price you pay for overstepping your bounds."</p><div class="pagination">
