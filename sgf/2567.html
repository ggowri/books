  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne had calmed down, but the anger and killing intent in his eyes had not faded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although it was eventually proven that Michelle's remains were not taken by Callista, Callista did bring guards to level Michelle's tomb and indeed intended to destroy her remains.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Michelle's remains were no longer in the tomb. But Callista's actions had completely crossed Osborne's bottom line.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Callista must die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne's hatred for Callista rose to the same level as that for the Glorious Divine Emperor; both were beings he must kill.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though the Glorious Divine Emperor was Osborne's father in his previous life, he still had to die.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, before that, Osborne needed to investigate everything related to Michelle, uncover the secrets surrounding her, and then deduce why a warrior capable of erasing timelines would take Michelle's body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go." Osborne suppressed his fury and killing intent as he walked out of the Royal Sepulcher. Since Michelle's remains were no longer there, there was no need for him to pay his respects.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire Royal Sepulcher was filled with members of the Glorious Divine Kingdom's Royal Family. These people were even less worthy of his respect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Justina only gave them ten minutes to enter the Royal Sepulcher and pay respects to the founder of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, Solomon. Now, the ten minutes were almost up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn</span><span>'</span><span>t want anyone to notice anything unusual, so he promptly returned to the main path.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By this time, most of the participants had already left, leaving only Clara and Leroy anxiously waiting for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Osborne come out, they finally relaxed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, are you okay?" Clara and Leroy felt something was off about Osborne. They had only been apart for ten minutes, but he seemed different. Most importantly, Osborne's expression was cold and stern, looking unusual.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head and said, "Don't worry about me. I'm fine. Let's head out first. If we take more than ten minutes to leave, someone might use this opportunity against us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Osborne took the lead and walked out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy exchanged a glance, didn't ask further, and quickly followed Osborne out of the Royal Sepulcher.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three of them returned to the large square outside the Royal Sepulcher on time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Justina said, "Follow me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is where the Glorious Sacrificial Ceremony is held. Soon, the Glorious Divine Emperor will arrive with all the Royal Family members, generals, officials of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, and representatives of other forces to perform the ritual. This is not a place for you to stay. Follow me to the edge of the square and wait quietly there."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After the ritual, it will be your turn to perform."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just like that, Justina led everyone to a corner of the square. There were a few trees in front, separating them from the square. They could only see the square through the gaps in the branches.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even so, they were incredibly excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although they could only stay in a corner of the square, they didn</span><span>'</span><span>t feel stifled at all. After all, only the influential and powerful of the Glorious Divine Kingdom could attend the Glorious Sacrificial Ceremony.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These contestants had not yet reached Empyrean Sacredness, so just being able to enter here was already an immense honor for them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man said, "If I could win the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel championship in front of these big figures, or even the Glorious Divine Emperor, that would be such an honor."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After winning the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel championship, I could make a name for myself throughout the entire Glorious Divine Kingdom. Maybe even the Glorious Divine Emperor might personally recruit me to join his private guard."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A woman said, "Stop dreaming."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If it were the previous Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, we might have had a chance to win. But this time is different. Nine princes and princesses are also participating in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel. Moreover, I heard that these princes and princesses could reach Empyrean Sacredness long ago but have been suppressing their cultivation level, waiting to compete in this Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Their strength is beyond ours. With them around, we can only compete for tenth place."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another man agreed, "Yes, it's such a pity."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While people chatted in small groups, Osborne was deep in thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His main purpose this time was to pay respects to Michelle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But after arriving here, he discovered more problems. Michelle's tomb was leveled by Callista and her guards, and Michelle's body was taken away by a mysterious warrior just three days after burial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, his attempt to pay respects was unsuccessful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Michelle's life and death became uncertain. Osborne didn't know if this was good or bad for him, so he could only continue investigating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the very least, he needed to uncover the secrets surrounding Michelle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly formulated his next plan in his mind, thinking, "After the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel ends, we will definitely enter Necropolis City. Necropolis City is one of the greatest secrets of the Glorious Divine Kingdom. My first task is to disrupt the Glorious Divine Emperor's plans in Necropolis City."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I absolutely cannot let the Glorious Divine Emperor gain power in Necropolis City and become a warrior at the Imperial Empyrean Sacredness level. Otherwise, the Glorious Divine Emperor will definitely leave the Racial Convergence Planet directly. He will pass the throne to Weston or Quinn, then enter the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign and venture deeper into the cosmos in search of higher cultivation levels and greater power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, stopping the Glorious Divine Emperor from advancing his cultivation level is the first step.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The second step is to reach Empyrean Sacredness and begin my revenge. At the same time, I must grow stronger until one day I can crush Callista, and even the Glorious Divine Emperor, underfoot. That way, I can learn everything about my mother from them, including why the Glorious Divine Emperor loved my mother and why Callista targeted her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After thinking, Osborne took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he looked up toward the main entrance of the Royal Sepulcher and sensed an energy fluctuation coming from there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, the main entrance of the Royal Sepulcher was opened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, a squad of Glorious Divine Kingdom soldiers marched in with orderly steps, followed by various ceremonial guards, who quickly arranged themselves above the square.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne knew the Glorious Sacrificial Ceremony was about to begin.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the Glorious Divine Emperor would lead all Royal Family members participating in the Glorious Sacrificial Ceremony, high-ranking generals and officials of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, as well as warriors from various major forces, into the Royal Sepulcher to commence the once-in-a-decade ritual.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne would soon see the Glorious Divine Emperor again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Glorious Divine Emperor, Frederick, was Osborne's father in his previous life. But in this life, he was merely Osborne's sworn enemy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, the war drums sounded, incomparably solemn. Immediately after, other instruments joined in. In the Royal Sepulcher, energy-filled flowers suddenly descended, dazzlingly bright.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, a tall and imposing figure slowly walked into the Royal Sepulcher.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at that figure, his expression turning very serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick had finally arrived. He strode in firmly, directly entering the Royal Sepulcher.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, in Osborne's eyes, it seemed as if everything else had vanished, leaving only that powerful figure he loathed and hated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He is the Glorious Divine Emperor!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Glorious Divine Emperor is here!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, upon seeing the Glorious Divine Emperor, the contestants around Osborne gasped softly, their faces full of respect and admiration.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, behind the Glorious Divine Emperor, a lavishly dressed woman slowly entered the Royal Sepulcher.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That is Callista!</span></p><div class="pagination">
