  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet came into view, it transformed from a tiny glass bead in the starry sky into a vast expanse, growing larger and larger until it filled their vision completely. Osborne and his companions had finally returned to </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several figures appeared before Osborne, and it was Isa, Clarissa, and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Maddox and his crew obediently following Osborne, Isa and the others let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not a single one of the Racial Convergence Planet folks managed to escape. You brought them all back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the situation now?" Osborne asked, his brow furrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa hesitated for a moment before replying, "It's a bit complicated."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh?" Osborne looked puzzled. "Come up to the Ascending Sacred Sanctum; let's hear the details."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded, leading the group into the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they surveyed the shabby appearance of the place, they were utterly taken aback. In contrast to the grandeur of the Sanctum of Night, this place seemed almost dilapidated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who could have imagined that such a rundown structure could possess such immense power? Just one confrontation had reduced Lord Malevolence's Malevolence Tower to ruins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they hadn't seen that victory with their own eyes, no one would have believed that the Ascending Sacred Sanctum was a Sacred Artifact, a palace of the Sacredness Level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa cast a quick look around before refocusing on the pressing issue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, while you were in pursuit of Maddox, two significant events took place on </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Firstly, the majority of the Dark Deity Legion and the various races under Lord Malevolence opted to surrender. After witnessing your defeat of Lord Malevolence, their morale was completely crushed. They're now extremely eager to pledge their loyalty to you and become your vassals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To them, they were already Lord Malevolence's subjects. With him gone, they have no desire for revenge; they just want to serve you and gain your protection."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Submit to me? Become my vassals?" Osborne furrowed his brows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no desire to rule </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet or emulate Lord Malevolence. Instead of chasing after power and control, he preferred to focus on his own self-improvement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa interjected, "Osborne, I believe this is a golden opportunity for you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understand your stance&mdash;you don't want to rule </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet the way Lord Malevolence did. But at present, who else can earn the respect of all? You're the sole one capable of maintaining order among the Human Community and the various races!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're reluctant to take on the role of the 'king' of </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet, the chaos will never cease! We can't simply relocate the other races to another planet. Even if we emerge victorious, the future of </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet demands that the Human Community coexist with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unless we exterminate them all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head at the mere thought. Exterminate them all? That was unthinkable. He just couldn't bring himself to commit such an act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slaughtering every single one of them would make him no better than Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was no cold-blooded butcher, nor a bloodthirsty maniac!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The total population of the various races was larger than that of the Human Community. Not every single one of them had committed heinous crimes; most were merely Lord Malevolence's subjects, following his commands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weren't entirely innocent, but they definitely didn't deserve to be put to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a throbbing headache coming on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The very idea of ruling over the combined population of hundreds of billions from both the Human Community and the various races was utterly draining.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa said, breaking the silence, "We'll stand by you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In fact, you don't have to do all that much. Just occupy that position and strike fear into those with ill intentions. Lay down some ground rules, and things will fall into place on their own!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Definitely, we're right behind you!" Clarissa added enthusiastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Osborne forced a wry smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, he finally nodded. "Fine! Just tell me what you need me to do, and I'll play along."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girls exchanged knowing looks, chuckling at how every part of him was resisting but he had no option but to agree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't fret! This will surely work to your advantage! For instance, once you become the king of </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet, finding your parents will be a breeze! With just a single word from you, everyone will spring into action to scour the entire planet," Isa elaborated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes brightened at that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still hadn't found his parents&mdash;there wasn't even a single lead&mdash;and it had been a persistent weight on his mind. </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet was so vast that two ordinary individuals could easily disappear without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had tried all kinds of tactics. For example, he established the Seven Young Deity Kings of the Human Community and used his parents' names to draw attention, </span><span>hoping</span><span> that they would come looking for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no luck at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They seemed to have vanished from </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne could become the ruler and rally everyone to search for them, he believed he could find them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'm in!" he finally said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa grinned. "Great! Just like Lord Malevolence, we'll create an empire! We've even come up with a name for it&mdash;you'll be the God of Night, and the empire will be called Empire of the Night!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but roll his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way!" This time, Osborne's response was emphatic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Empire of the Night? That name sounds dodgy, almost evil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa and her companions were convinced that Osborne was the reincarnation of the God of Night. To them, it was only fitting that his empire bore the name "Empire of the Night". But Osborne wasn't on board with this notion at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even now, he hadn't truly wrapped his head around the idea that he was the reincarnation of the fabled God of Night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girls exchanged glances, surprised at his strong opposition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa raised an eyebrow. "Then you propose a name."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's thought, Osborne declared, "Let's call it the Empire of the Sun!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Empire of the Sun?!" Isa repeated, her eyes widening in realization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others nodded along, with Clarissa and Emma looking particularly pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the place they had hidden away in was called the Court of the Sun!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, it's settled! The Empire of the Sun it is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just a few simple words, the Empire of the Sun was established, poised to become the one and only empire of </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet, the highest center of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every person on </span><span>Celestara</span><span> Planet would have to become a subject of the Empire of the Sun, obeying its commands and rules.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that was a concern for the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just so we're clear, I can be the king of the Empire of the Sun, but I'm not dealing with any of the mundane details! I'd much rather spend my time with you guys," Osborne declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girls all laughed, warmth shining in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood, Your Majesty!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your Majesty?" he replied, scratching his nose awkwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being referred to like that felt so strange to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne knew he had to get used to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quickly changing the subject, he asked, "Isa, you mentioned there were two major events. What was the second one?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
