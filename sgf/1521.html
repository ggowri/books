  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Celestara, most people feared encountering Deathborns. With their low intelligence, once they caught sight of living beings, they would relentlessly pursue them, attacking without mercy&mdash;truly a headache to deal with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The biggest drawback? Killing them brought no rewards, only trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet there was Osborne, practically buzzing with excitement at the sight of the Deathborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gathered horde sent his pulse racing; he longed to leap into battle and wipe them out entirely to aid in restoring the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at all these Deathborn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah gasped in disbelief, clearly taken aback by the sheer number of Deathborn gathered in one place. Though she quickly masked her alarm, her anxiety was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder my family had to pause the Essence Crystal mining. With so many Deathborn around, it's far too dangerous for the miners to work!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan, what do we do next? I promised Grandpa that I would eliminate all the Deathborn in the Essence Crystal mine and get it back up and running. This is the first time I've wanted to contribute to my family, and you absolutely have to help me. I don't want to disappoint my family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced at her, then fell quiet for a moment, considering her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had quietly activated his Satan's Eye, peering deeper into the mine's depths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the number of Deathborn was staggering, he noticed none were of Celestial Deity rank or higher. While their strength was formidable, he felt confident they could handle the fight. But he wasn't going to rush in just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he acted too soon, they would release an abundance of vitality, and nearby Deathborns would certainly come running.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last thing they needed was a swarm of Celestial Deity-level Deathborn&mdash;or even worse, Deity Overlord Deathborn&mdash;closing in on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were just Osborne, he wouldn't worry too much; he could always escape using his spatial power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with Hannah alongside him, he needed to be careful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For now, he didn't want to reveal his secret abilities to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, it was crucial to ascertain the details of the Deathborn deep within the mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using the keen sight of his Satan's Eye, Osborne scanned the main mine shaft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was crawling with Deathborns, but still no sign of anything above Celestial Deity level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How many lurked deeper in the shadows was uncertain, but with solid rock obstructing his view, Osborne could only see out to about three miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And within that distance? No Celestial Deity-level threats&mdash;at least, none that he could detect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During combat, Osborne could continue to observe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he detected a large number of Celestial Deity-ranked Deathborns approaching, he could retreat in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is doable!" He finally decided, feeling the thrill of the fight bubbling up inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne met Hannah's eager gaze, he smiled, "Don't worry! I'll take care of every single one of these Deathborns and get the mine back up and running. Your family won't be disappointed in you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face lit up with gratitude. "Thank you! That means a lot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what's the plan now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied, confidence radiating from him, "Simple. We charge in and take them out! There are plenty of Deathborns here, but they're all below Celestial Deity rank. Plus, they're not exactly masterminds; they lack the smarts to coordinate a clever attack. Together, we can </span><span>destroy</span><span> them</span><span> </span><span>like </span><span>a bulldozer</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's eyes widened in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's a bulldozer?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh..." Osborne scratched his head, momentarily at a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not the point! The real takeaway is that with both our powers combined, we can definitely handle them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure you're not afraid?" he asked, eyes narrowing as he scrutinized Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her strength, it was clear she had little combat experience, especially against Deathborns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's cheeks flushed at Osborne's words. "How could I be afraid? I wouldn't even flinch in the face of a Deity Overlord warrior! I have total confidence in my ability to defeat them! I've taken down countless young geniuses from all the clans; fear isn't in my vocabulary!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, a smile spreading across his face. "Then let's get to it! You're stronger than I am, so you'll take the lead while I support you. Sound good?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah straightened her back, determination shining in her eyes. "Absolutely!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just stay right behind me. If any Deathborns manage to survive my initial attack, you can finish them off. I'll handle everything else!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, she continued, "But be careful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once I start attacking, I won't be able to completely mask our life signature. That'll definitely attract more Deathborns. Don't worry, though; I can keep our life signature to a minimum. The Deathborn several miles away won't catch our scent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne felt a surge of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they could keep their presence concealed, they'd be much safer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm ready! Let's do this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright!" Hannah exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A powerful divine power swirled around her, merging with a terrifying darkness that coalesced into countless black arrows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce determination, she unleashed them toward the cluster of Deathborns ahead.</span></p><div class="pagination">
