  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the number of Celestial Deity-level Deathborn dwindled, the battle became increasingly manageable. Both Osborne and Hannah inevitably began to let their guard down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah, in particular, was caught up in the excitement. Having never experienced such a chaotic battle before, she felt a rush of exhilaration at the prospect of victory. The thought of wiping out all the remaining Celestial Deity-level Deathborns filled her with joy, even more so than triumphing over the top talents of the other races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this moment of triumph, she couldn't help but relax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Osborne was right there with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his strength, even if she held back, he could easily finish off the remaining Celestial Deity-level Deathborns on his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our teamwork is absolutely flawless!" Hannah declared, a proud smile spreading across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as she reveled in her success, disaster struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither she nor Osborne noticed that while they were engaged in combat with the Celestial Deity-level Deathborns, two even more powerful Deathborns had been stealthily traversing through the solid rock in a spectral form, now positioned directly behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the moment Hannah was basking in her accomplishments and Osborne was focused on attacking another Celestial Deity-level Deathborn, the two Deathborns suddenly emerged from the rock. In an instant, they shifted from their ethereal state to their physical forms and launched a simultaneous attack on both Hannah and Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed and force of the assault were overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time Hannah sensed something was off, it was already too late to dodge or counterattack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a startled cry, she barely managed to summon her divine power for defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next second, the attack struck her with terrifying force, shattering her defenses and slamming into her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was sent flying, blood spraying from her mouth as she hurtled through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simultaneously, Osborne faced his own assault. However, his reflexes were quicker than Hannah's. As the dreadful attack approached from behind, he instinctively reacted, channeling his power to unleash a Thunderform Flash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brilliant arcs of electricity enveloped him, propelling him forward at lightning speed while also providing a protective barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Osborne couldn't completely evade the attack, he managed to avoid taking a direct hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blow was powerful enough to shatter his lightning defense, but it left his Divine Body unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything happened in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One moment, Osborne and Hannah believed victory was within reach, and the next, they were both sent sprawling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The difference was that Osborne had actively dodged while Hannah was violently thrown back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Hannah spitting blood and turning pale sent a wave of dread through Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deity Overlord-level Deathborn! Two of them!" he exclaimed, his expression shifting to one of grave concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He forced himself to regain control, quickly turning to the two Deity Overlord-level Deathborns that were now racing toward the injured Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic surged within him. Hannah was severely hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer power of the Deity Overlord-level Deathborn's surprise attack was devastating; even with her formidable strength, she had been unable to withstand it unprepared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That Hannah hadn't been outright killed was a testament to her resilience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, in her weakened state, if those two Deity Overlord-level Deathborns struck her again, it would be the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Hannah, still conscious but barely so, looked up in horror as the two Deity Overlord-level Deathborns charged toward her. Despair filled her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if she hadn't been injured, facing off against two of them would have been a nearly impossible task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I really going to die here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold wave of despair washed over Hannah as she helplessly watched the two Deity Overlord-level Deathborns charging toward her at breakneck speed. She felt utterly defenseless, unable to react or dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All she could do was wait for her fate to unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was still far away. Even if he used Thunderform Flash, he wouldn't be able to reach her in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this how it ends? I can't believe I, Hannah, am going to die like this. I haven't even gotten married yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scent of death hung thick in the air, and she couldn't shake the feeling that her time was up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All those times I kept my identity hidden from the top talents of the other races, and now no one knows my true potential. I was finally ready to make my mark, and now... it's all going to be for nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the two Deity Overlord-level Deathborns closing in, their grotesque forms and overwhelming power were clearer than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their killing intent radiated from them like a palpable force, leaving Hannah engulfed in despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't take it anymore. With her eyes shut, Hannah braced for the inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne's face was a mix of hesitation and turmoil. Even using Thunderform Flash wouldn't be enough to save her at this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt trapped, knowing there was only one way to truly rescue Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had to use spatial power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But using it would reveal his identity, and that could lead to dire consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do I really want to save Hannah?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The question loomed heavily in his mind as he watched in horror, realizing Hannah was on the brink of death at the hands of the Deity Overlord-level Deathborns. With time running out and Hannah's life hanging by a thread, Osborne made his decision.</span></p><div class="pagination">
