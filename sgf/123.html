  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cheers, Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for bringing me this top-notch wine and making me money," Austin said sincerely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They clinked glasses, and Austin eagerly took a sip. The next moment, her eyes lit up as she quickly finished the glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is so delicious!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin said with delight. "I used to think drinking was pointless and did not understand why Barlyn had such a fascination with wine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now I finally get it - it is because I have never tasted truly good wine before! This is amazing, better than anything I have ever had."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to have another two glasses."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Austin poured herself another glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had finished his glass too. He shared Austin's enthusiasm, unable to describe how good it was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he knew was he wanted more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pour me another glass," Osborne said quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he forgot about his plan to 'take advantage' of Barlyn and genuinely wanted to enjoy another glass and savor the flavor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They continued drinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just ten minutes, the bottle was emptied, and both still felt unsatisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh no, we drank all the wine and did not leave any for Barlyn. Will he be mad when he comes back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin said, looking a bit embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face, already flushed from drinking, now looked even more charmingly radiant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne noticed her and found her especially attractive at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly shook off the feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin did not notice Osborne's reaction and was worried. "Oh no, Barlyn is definitely going to be furious. He will probably complain about us for a month."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne found it amusing when he heard it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was exactly the effect he wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He comforted, "It is okay. I have more wine. But let's tease him when he gets back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin's eyes suddenly lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked excitedly, "How do you want to tease him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waved her over, and Austin leaned in, pressing her ear close to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne caught a whiff of her pleasant scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, he felt a stir in his heart and a different sensation in his lower abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly suppressed it and whispered in Austin's ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin was excited and nodded frequently, but soon felt a tickling sensation in her ear from Osborne's warm breath, which immediately gave her a strange feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, her earlobe turned red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tried to ignore the strange feeling, nodded quickly, and said, "Got it, Osborne. I will follow your plan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then moved away quickly, her face flushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, she had been drinking, so Osborne did not notice her unusual reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thud, thud, thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, hurried footsteps and Barlyn's angry voice were heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, I am back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, calling me back for some vague situation, wasting my time. Where is my wine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn stormed in and then froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at the empty bottle and clutched his chest, a look of despair on his face. He let out a heartbreaking scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, My wine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Glacium Beauty!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two, idiots! How could you drink it all without waiting for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, you are too much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn's anguished cries left Osborne and Austin speechless. His wails were as if he had just lost his beloved wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you screaming?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin called out quickly. "Who told you to be so busy? The wine was already ready; we had to drink it before it went bad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It would have been a waste otherwise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the wine was truly amazing. I am someone who does not like wine, but just one sip and I could not stop. It is the best thing I have ever had."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is a shame you missed out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who knows if you will get another chance in your lifetime."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin said nostalgically, making Barlyn's wailing even more intense. He clutched his head, almost going mad. For a wine lover, seeing one of the world's top wines consumed without him having a single sip was pure agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn regretted going back to the Radcliffe Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "If I had not returned, I could have enjoyed the top-tier wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did I go back?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did I have to be the head of the security team?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I were not the head, he would not have been disturbed and could have savored the top-notch wine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Barlyn had thoughts of resigning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Head of security?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whoever wants to do it, let them!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
