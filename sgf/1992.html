  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>God of Light</span><span>, are you kidding me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian was in shock, barely able to process what he was hearing. "The Hudson family submitted a list with ten thousand of the highest Deity King level geniuses? Ten thousand! Are you sure that's right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even we, at HeartUnited Alliance, only have just over ten thousand of those top-tier Deity Kings. Mr. Jackson, I'd imagine your family's numbers are pretty close, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten thousand Deity Kings at the highest level... from the Hudson family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And on top of that, the Hudson family is supposed to have a hundred Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings? How is that even possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A hundred Supernal Deity Kings?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When did Supernal Deity Kings start being so common? I can't believe it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian finished speaking, and the others couldn't help but nod in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian had voiced what was on everyone's mind. They all knew the Hudson family well, and as far as they were concerned, the Hudsons ranked near the bottom of the Dukedom-level power structure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From their intelligence...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hudson family had only a little over a thousand of the highest Deity Kings. Even at their peak, they only had two or three thousand at most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Supernal Deity Kings? They were practically nonexistent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's more, the few Supernal Deity Kings they had were mostly dead by now. Wasn't Jethro the only one left?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So where on earth did these hundred Supernal Deity Kings come from?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone turned their eyes toward Jethro, then to </span><span>God of Light</span><span>, waiting for an explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light</span><span> spoke calmly, "So, as I said, I was pretty shocked by the list Mr. Hudson submitted. The reason I didn't include anyone from the Hudson family on today's roster is because their list was too perfect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hudson suggested that, if possible, we should have these individuals from his family compete in the border competition. They work so well together, they've got perfect chemistry... if they fight as a team, they could showcase even more power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, I haven't seen them in action yet, so I wasn't willing to risk putting them on the line. That's why I didn't arrange for any Hudson family members to compete today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once I've verified the strength of the people on their list, though, the Hudson family will definitely enter the competition. And most likely, they'll sweep the Deity Overlord Level, the Deity King Level, and the Ascension One Supernal Deity King categories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, is there anyone who still has doubts?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After </span><span>God of Light</span><span> finished speaking, the room was filled with stunned silence. Everyone collectively gasped, utterly shaken by the revelation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro... was going to let the Hudson family sweep all three of the major competitions?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten thousand top-tier Deity Overlords...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten thousand of the highest Deity Kings...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And a hundred Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't that the perfect lineup to dominate those three categories?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How was this even possible?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the top three powerhouses&mdash;Jackson family, HeartUnited Alliance&mdash;had never dreamed of sweeping a single competition, let alone all three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, the Hudson family&mdash;whom they'd all looked down on&mdash;was about to claim them all?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone, at this moment, was completely dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian furrowed his brow. "How could the Hudson family possibly be this strong? With this kind of power, they could easily be ranked among the top five Dukedom-level powers in the entire Human Community, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Jethro. "Jethro, aren't you going to explain yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro sneered. "Julian, don't you think you're going too far? Why should I explain anything to you? </span><span>God of Light</span><span> didn't ask me to explain, so who do you think you are, demanding answers from me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were the one who doubted that the Hudson family betrayed the Human Community, accusing me of not submitting the list of Hudson family geniuses. Now </span><span>God of Light</span><span> has cleared that up and proven our case, and you still want me to explain myself?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why should I? Who says the Hudson family can't have this kind of power? Are you upset because our strength is growing? Can't handle it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who do you think you are?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro's voice was cold, cutting through the air, and Julian's face flushed a deep red, his anger rising to the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jethro, you're asking for it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you talk to me like that? You think just because the Hudson family's hiding its strength, you can stand up to HeartUnited Alliance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light</span><span>'s sharp voice cut through the tension like a whip. "Julian, you're out of line! I've already given you the explanation you wanted. As for why the Hudson family's strength is so much greater than you thought... they don't owe you or anyone else an explanation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, this is great news for the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, let's not bring this up again. Everyone can rest easy&mdash;I'll select the participants for the border competition fairly and impartially. People from Sanctum of Light will also be involved, fighting alongside us for the dignity of the Human Community."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her words, Julian quickly dropped his head, silenced, no longer daring to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, the first border competition is about to begin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, let's head to the viewing area!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, </span><span>God of Light</span><span> shot a meaningful glance at Julian and Jethro before leading the group toward a massive platform belonging to the Sanctum of Light, gazing off toward the distant viewing platform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The competition on that platform was about to kick off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian finally lifted his head, a cold glint flashing deep in his eyes. He shot one last, piercing look at Jethro before turning his attention to the viewing platform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro didn't acknowledge Julian. He, too, focused his gaze on the distant platform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The colossal viewing platform overlooked a vast battlefield stretching over 300 miles in every direction. On either side of the field stood two groups of warriors, each radiating a fierce, oppressive energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the left were ten thousand Transcendent Deity-level geniuses from the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the right stood ten thousand Transcendent Deity-level geniuses from the Unity Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were separated by a great distance but locked in a fierce stare-off, each pair of eyes burning with battle intent, icy killing intent simmering just beneath the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, on the battlefield below, hundreds of billions of Human Community forces and the Dark Deity Legion had all looked up toward the viewing platform. Their voices roared in unison, echoing across the field. The overwhelming bloodlust and battle fervor reverberated through the air, shaking the earth itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>God of Light</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the massive projection of the Icy One appeared again. His eyes fixed on the group from the Sanctum of Light, a cruel smile tugging at the corners of his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The time has come. What do you think, </span><span>God of Light</span><span>? Is it time to start the first border competition?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, </span><span>God of Light</span><span> nodded slightly and said coolly, "Then let it begin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As her words echoed through the air, the surrounding cheers grew even louder, more frenzied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill! Eradicate the worthless Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight! Bring glory to the Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unity Clan will win!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Human Community, rise up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid the chaos of shouts, the ten thousand Transcendent Deity-level geniuses from the Human Community and the ten thousand from the Unity Clan all began to move in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The border competition had begun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first match was a Transcendent Deity-level showdown!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two groups, twenty thousand peak Transcendent Deity-level warriors in total, each one a genius among geniuses, charged toward each other at breakneck speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the battle erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The collision of twenty thousand Transcendent Deity-level warriors was nothing short of cataclysmic. Fierce, brutal attacks were exchanged, and in a matter of seconds, the battlefield was soaked in blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a battle to the death&mdash;a brutal, unrelenting bloodbath.</span></p><div class="pagination">
