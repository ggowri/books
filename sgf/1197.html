  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thousands of Class S Dark Exotic Beasts surged around Osborne, with at least a thousand of them being top-tier Class S, a tremendous and terrifying force to reckon with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just two days ago, he would have had no choice but to run for his life&mdash;and even then, he'd need every Blood Demon member's support to stand a chance, likely paying a heavy price for any sliver of victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne barely blinked at the sight of these creatures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suspended in the center of the massive lair, he flared his Nightshade Wings, which boasted an impressive wingspan of over one hundred yards. They stirred gently, casting a shadow over the surrounding chaos. Any Dark Exotic Beast foolish enough to approach him was met with a deadly strike of dark power that shot forth from his wings, easily piercing through their bodies and shredding them to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One after another, the Dark Exotic Beasts rained down like leaves in a storm, and any feeble attempts to strike back were effortlessly repelled by his Nightshade Wings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They truly were both offensive and defensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had always envied Clarissa's Divine and Demonic Wings; they were not only stylish but incredibly powerful in both attack and defense&mdash;better than any divine artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he had his own Nightshade Wings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the hundreds of Dark Exotic Beasts that dared approach him lay dead, leaving a growing vacancy around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, for all their effectiveness, Nightshade Wings couldn't rival the efficiency of the Abyssal Spiral.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the center of this maelstrom of beasts, the Abyssal Spiral began as a small vortex but was quickly expanding. Once it reached a radius of 328 feet, its insatiable gravitational pull became so immense that even the Class S Dark Exotic Beasts could not escape it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Groups of these monstrous beasts were irresistibly drawn toward the Abyssal Spiral, swallowed up and shredded by the raging dark power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They disappeared completely, leaving no trace behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each beast that fell, the Abyssal Spiral grew stronger and spun more violently, rapidly swelling to a whopping 3280-foot radius.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, the vortex's devouring force extended so far that even Dark Exotic Beasts standing at a distance could not resist its pull.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how fiercely they struggled, they were inexorably dragged toward the maelstrom, ultimately disappearing into its depths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground quaked as the terrible force erupted. In mere moments, roughly a third of the Dark Exotic Beasts had been consumed and destroyed by the Abyssal Spiral.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panicked, the remaining beasts turned tail, fleeing toward the lair's exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think you can escape?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked, his body flickering before he rapidly appeared at the cave mouth. All the Dark Exotic Beasts trying to retreat met a swift end, annihilated by his Nightshade Wings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the Abyssal Spiral in the lair's heart expanded even larger, and its devouring power intensified. Even Osborne felt the sheer magnitude was becoming a bit excessive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pondered, "It seems the power of the Abyssal Spiral correlates with its size! The larger it gets, the stronger it becomes! But as it expands, I drain more energy, which means my control weakens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I'm not careful, this thing could collapse on itself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, I can push the Abyssal Spiral to a maximum radius of 16 thousand feet! Beyond that, I wouldn't be able to control it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he strategized, the Abyssal Spiral had now reached a size of 10 thousand feet, its horrifying force enveloping the Dark Exotic Beast den.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of the creatures could escape; they were ensnared by the abyssal vortex, dragged in and torn apart&mdash;obliterated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shrieks of the Dark Exotic Beasts echoed through the lair, a chilling symphony of despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne's heart showed no mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he didn't eradicate these Dark Exotic Beasts, they would flee, leaving destruction in their wake and slaughtering humanity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were enemies, pure and simple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when it came to enemies, compassion had no place in battle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the immense lair of the Dark Exotic Beasts, it felt as if a terrifying storm had erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything within was caught in the violent swirl of the Abyssal Spiral, devoured and shredded into nothingness, leaving only a rich, dense energy of blood in its wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne absorbed this blood energy, channeling it through a special conduit directly into the bodies of the Blood Demon members waiting at the fissure's exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the exit of the fissure, all the Blood Demon members sat cross-legged, immersed in deep concentration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waves of powerful blood energy streamed through the void, flooding into their bodies and propelling them to new heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This abundant energy was like a potent tonic, nourishing their Blood Clan forms perfectly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the energy coursed through them, they began to experience breakthroughs, one after another, evolving into elite Class S warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each surge of blood energy felt revitalizing, sending tingles through their veins as they felt their power amplify and their realms shift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer volume of blood energy pouring in from the fallen Dark Exotic Beasts was staggering. However, even with such an abundance, it wouldn't be enough to elevate every last Blood Demon to the pinnacle of Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within the lair, silence reigned except for the massive cocoon still hanging on the walls, pulsating like a heart, its rhythm quickening with each passing moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a furious, haunting roar echoed through the chamber, shattering the stillness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a deep crack formed across the surface of the immense cocoon.</span></p><div class="pagination">
