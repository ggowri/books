  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's expression shifted to one of shock as she locked eyes with the newcomer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Goodrich! What are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oberon scoffed, and his voice dripped with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I hadn't shown up, you would have led Mystic Feather Clan to ruin! Now, as a senior elder of Mystic Feather Clan, I'm ordering you to come back with me to the clan headquarters. You'll confess to the Bowman family and await your punishment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mystic Feather Clan has always remained loyal to the esteemed Lord Malevolence, but the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings have killed the heir of the Bowman family, Alfred. They've attracted the Stellar Pursuit Mandate and are now enemies of both the Paramount Supreme Clan and Lord Malevolence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can you, Hannah, a member of Mystic Feather Clan, align yourself with the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, let alone fight alongside them? How are we supposed to answer to the esteemed Lord Malevolence?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, listen up! Come with me now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should know the location of Wild Flame City's Mystic Feather Clan, right? Start talking, and maybe you can redeem yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed Hannah with a steely glare, and his authority was evident as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's face paled at his words as she clenched her fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Goodrich, are you serious? Do you want me to go back to Mystic Feather Clan and confess to the Bowman family? Why on earth would I do that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They've been trying to wipe out our Wild Flame City's Mystic Feather Clan without so much as a valid reason! It was the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings who saved us by killing Aldrich and Alfred!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And now you want me to confess to the Bowman family? This makes no sense! We've done nothing wrong. Why should we admit guilt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oberon's voice rose sharply. "Ridiculous! Hannah, what nonsense are you spouting? I'm commanding you to come back with me right now! Are you trying to betray Mystic Feather Clan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah bit her lip, and her expression turned icy. "Betray Mystic Feather Clan?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If not confessing to the Bowman family is considered betrayal, then so be it! The clan headquarters didn't come to our aid when we were attacked unjustly! Mr. Goodrich, you didn't come to our rescue either!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings who saved us. I'm not so naive as to fail to recognize who my true benefactors are and who my enemies are. Do you want me to abandon my benefactors and apologize to my enemies? That's just not going to happen!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she finished speaking, Oberon's face darkened, shaking with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impertinent brat! If you refuse to come with me, I'll drag you back myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he reached out, summoning a massive hand of divine power that lunged toward Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Oberon's hand was about to seize her, Hannah scoffed and retaliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Swinging her Supreme Malevolence Sword, she unleashed a wave of black sword light that slammed into his divine hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The collision erupted in a dazzling flash, but while Hannah's sword energy splintered, Oberon's divine hand pressed on, unfazed as it continued to seek Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's expression shifted as panic gripped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're underestimating me. I'm a senior elder of Mystic Feather Clan, at the later stage of Deity King strength. Do you think you can just throw your weight around? You'll regret this. It's time to come back obediently!" Oberon smirked, and confidence radiated from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next moment, his demeanor shifted dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly stepped in front of Hannah, facing down Oberon's outstretched hand. He threw a punch, shattering Oberon's divine grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood like an impenetrable wall between Hannah and Oberon, glaring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oberon, how can you be so shameless?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't you understand plain words? Hannah has done nothing wrong. Why do you insist on dragging her back to Mystic Feather Clan? Do you want her to face death at the hands of the Bowman family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really regard her as one of you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shot Oberon a scathing look, making it clear he would not allow any harm to come to Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell do you think you are? What gives you the right to meddle in the affairs of the Mystic Feather Clan?" Oberon narrowed his eyes, and his expression darkened even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a calm smile, Osborne replied, "Hannah is my friend, and of course, I'm going to look out for her. Unlike you, who pretend to treat her like family but stand by while she's in danger, only to drag her off to the Bowman family for execution."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for death!" Oberon's eyes blazed with fury, and he was ready to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, remained unfazed, clearly uninterested in getting tangled up in a fight with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oberon, today is about the clash between the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings and the young talents of the various clans. If you dare to make a move, I'll walk away right now. We don't need to fight at all. After all, it seems your young talents are too scared to face the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings in a fair fight, so they send an old man like you to wear us down. Are you afraid of losing to us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished, Osborne cast a scornful glance at the surrounding warriors from the various clans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a commanding voice echoed through the air. "Mr. Goodrich, why don't you save your Mystic Feather Clan business for after the arena battle is over?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
