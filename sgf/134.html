  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression was a bit dazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been hearing that Skyefall Security Services was up for sale. He had wondered why the Godfather would want to sell it. It seemed unnecessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Skyefall Security Services was operating very well. It had over a thousand professional bodyguards. More than a hundred of them were directly affiliated with the Draco Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest were also long-term contractors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyefall Security Services cooperated with all the major families and forces in Skyefall. It had a good reputation and was recognized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as the management did not mess up, Skyefall Security Services could contribute over a billion in profits to the Draco Group headquarters annually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this situation, why would the Godfather want to sell Skyefall Security Services?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, seeing this transfer agreement, Osborne finally understood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather never intended to sell Skyefall Security Services from the start.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He released the news of selling Skyefall Security Services to mislead others into thinking it was no longer affiliated with the Draco Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, Skyefall Security Services was prepared as a reward for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A security company worth billions, with over a thousand professional bodyguards. It was over a billion in annual profits, various networks, and influence...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this the reward from the Godfather?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, he was shocked by this reward. His boldest guess was that the Godfather would reward him with a company worth billions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never expected it to be Skyefall Security Services.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyefall Security Services was extremely important to him now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, he had a lot of cash but no power of his own. He was a loner and insignificant to truly powerful forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Osborne finally had his own power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although nine-tenths of the thousand professional bodyguards at Skyefall Security Services were contractors, as their boss, he couldn't directly order them to risk their lives for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as their boss, getting them to cooperate wasn't a problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Skyefall Security Services had over a hundred experts, secretly trained by the Draco Group. They would fully obey Osborne in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like Violet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like Sharon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These two were experts trained by the Draco Group from a young age, loyal to the Draco Group and Skyefall Security Services. From now on, they would be loyal to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over a hundred people might not seem like much. But for Osborne now, it was more than enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, those hundred-plus people were all at the level of Violet and Sharon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over a hundred experts at Violet and Sharon's level. What a formidable force that was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least in Mayby City and even in Skyefall, there wouldn't be many forces daring to confront him head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't hesitate and immediately signed his name on the transfer contract.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From then on, he owned 100% of Skyefall Security Services.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just after he signed, a call came in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, is this Mr. Augustine? I'm Valentin. I'm in charge of Skyefall Security Services. I've received orders from headquarters and will follow your commands from now on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have any instructions, Mr. Augustine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was shocked. He took a deep breath and said, "I have no orders for now. Just continue operating Skyefall Security Services as usual. I'll visit when I have time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, Mr. Augustine. We all look forward to your arrival."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hanging up the call with Valentin, Osborne was calm again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was thinking about how to use Skyefall Security Services to truly achieve a leap in status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Should he announce his identity and officially become a wealthy figure in Mayby City?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or should he continue to hide his identity and seek greater benefits in the shadows?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimately, Osborne decided to continue hiding his identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, if Osborne announced he was the new boss of Skyefall Security Services, he would immediately become a top figure in Mayby City. Even in the entire Skyefall province, he would be notable, with countless top figures trying to curry favor with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even ancient families like the Radcliffe family...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would come to please him just to get Skyefall Security Services' Class A defense system.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, Osborne decided to hide his identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once his identity was exposed, more people would try to curry favor with him, and more troubles would come. He still had new heir tests ahead and didn't want trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keeping a low profile was the way to go!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A great man from Rosmandi once said, never let your enemies know all your cards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's time to upgrade Satan's Eye to level four!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath. He calmed himself and began upgrading Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed to activate Satan's Eye and maintain it for an hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After preparing, Osborne activated Satan's Eye. Suddenly, the world became incredibly clear to his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After ten minutes, Osborne's eyes felt a bit sore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After twenty minutes, his eyes felt a bit painful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thirty minutes, Osborne was crying uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After forty minutes, his eyes started bleeding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he gritted his teeth and persisted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to upgrade Satan's Eye to level four to enhance his strength.</span></p><div class="pagination">
