  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After killing Valentino, the Magma Devourer immediately set its sights on Brenda, Dustin, and the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their faces changed drastically in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Stared at by the Magma Devourer's furious, massive eyes, they felt a chill all over, as if a mountain was pressing down on them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Amid the Magma Devourer's roar, their bodies stiffened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only Brenda could still move at this moment. "Run!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without any hesitation, Brenda turned and started fleeing frantically. She believed her strength was slightly greater than Valentino's, but not by much.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since Valentino was easily crushed to death by the Magma Devourer with one stomp, she definitely couldn't withstand a second.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, she ran straight away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What are you all standing there for? Run quickly. This is a Silicon-based Lifeform, the Magma Devourer. And it's an advanced Empyrean Sacredness-level Magma Devourer. Even we judges can't handle it. Hurry and escape. We'll hold it off."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go quickly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, several judges appeared directly, shouting at Dustin, Mckinley, and the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They immediately regained their senses and turned to run without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the person who stole the Beast Soul Flower trying to escape, the Magma Devourer became even angrier, let out a roar, and was about to chase after them without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Beast, stop!" At this moment, numerous judges finally arrived and, together with Prescott, stood in front of the Magma Devourer, preventing it from chasing the contestants.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All thirty nearby judges arrived, consisting of thirty warriors at advanced Empyrean Sacredness. This was an incredibly terrifying force. Yet even so, they dared not be careless. Everyone unleashed their Sacred Power frantically, activating all the Sacred Artifacts they could to protect themselves.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Magma Devourer, blocked, roared again, "They stole my Beast Soul Flower. They all deserve to die! If you dare stop me, </span><span>you're</span><span> accomplices. You must die too! I'll kill you all!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, the Magma Devourer charged toward the thirty judges at advanced Empyrean Sacredness. </span><span>Its</span><span> terrifying power surged, instantly causing the judges' expressions to change drastically.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Prescott gritted his teeth and said, "Let's attack together. No matter what, we must stop it and prevent it from killing again. Fight!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the thirty judges attacked together. Terrifying Sacred Power surged wildly, and various powerful Sacred Artifacts erupted fiercely, all striking the massive body of the Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Due to its massive body, the Magma Devourer couldn't evade any attacks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, it never intended to dodge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a silicon-based lifeform, its body was incredibly strong. As long as it devoured magma, it could keep growing stronger, completely ignoring these attacks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, the concentrated attacks struck the massive body of the Magma Devourer, only stirring up waves of flames without breaking through its defense. The Magma Devourer didn&rsquo;t even take a step back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You all deserve to die! You're accomplices! Die!" After withstanding everyone's attacks, the Magma Devourer roared. It opened its massive mouth and spewed scorching magma at the crowd furiously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the terrifying magma covered the sky, engulfing even the judges.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No!" The judges looked extremely grave, defending with all their might. But a few of them still couldn't withstand it. Their defenses were instantly pierced by the terrifying magma. As a result, they suffered severe injuries and kept retreating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The magma spewed by the Magma Devourer was no ordinary magma but the embodiment of fire power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if they activated a top-grade Defensive Sacred Artifact, they might not withstand that scorching power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the defenses of over a dozen judges were broken, leaving them severely injured. The remaining ones were also struggling, retreating continuously and using all their strength to block the magma.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, the Magma Devourer struck again. "Die, all of you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, the Magma Devourer raised its massive forelimb and stomped down on an injured judge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, that judge was crushed into a pulp, just like Valentino.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation made the other judges' faces change drastically, as they were completely no match for the Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though they were all at advanced Empyrean Sacredness, the same cultivation level as the Magma Devourer, and even though they possessed numerous Sacred Artifacts, they were still no match for the Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Magma Devourer's power was fully revealed at this moment, leaving them utterly hopeless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, Brenda and the others had already moved away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We retreat," Prescott said through gritted teeth. "I have already informed Mr. Norton. He will soon arrive with the other judges. Then, we will have a final showdown with this Magma Devourer."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After he finished speaking, all the judges began to retreat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the limitations of the Magma Devourer's low intelligence became apparent. It had the power to crush all the judges. If it targeted one judge and killed them, that judge would have absolutely no chance of survival and would undoubtedly be slain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter how hard the other judges tried, they couldn't save him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, whenever the Magma Devourer injured a judge and tried to pursue them, the other judges would launch an attack. This immediately enraged it, causing it to abandon the injured judge and attack the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this situation, although it always held the absolute upper hand, continuously injuring the judges, it was never able to completely kill them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The more this happened, the angrier the Magma Devourer became. But it made no changes at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne hid in the back, watching everything. He was shocked but also relieved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Creator is fair, giving Silicon-based Lifeforms such terrifying bodies and talents, yet leaving their intelligence at a very low level. If they possessed the same powerful intellect as the Spirit Clan, no other race in the cosmos could defeat them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then, ruling this cosmos should have been the Silicon-based Lifeforms, right?" Osborne sighed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial nodded and said, "Actually, the most perfect beings in the cosmos are indeed the Spirit Clan. Although the Spirit Clan's bodies are the weakest&mdash;not as strong as the Silicon-based Lifeforms, the Beast Clan, or even the Bug Clan and Plant Clan&mdash;their talent, intelligence, potential, and strong reproductive ability are unmatched."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Other clans really can't compare to the Spirit Clan."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, "By the way, you mentioned before that besides Carbon-based Lifeforms and Silicon-based Lifeforms, there is also a Singular Lifeform in the cosmos. What does Singular Lifeform refer to?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial calmly said, "All intelligent lifeforms that do not belong to Carbon-based Lifeforms or Silicon-based Lifeforms are collectively called Singular Lifeforms, such as your </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If the </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow continues to grow, it will one day reach a limit, then suddenly gain an Artifact Soul, developing intelligence, as if it has come to life."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At that time, your </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow can be considered a Singular Lifeform."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Or, a massive metal mountain absorbs spiritual energy day and night, and one day suddenly gains intelligence; this is also a Singular Lifeform."</span></p><div class="pagination">
