  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne finally stepped out of his training room.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the other room, it was still calm. Agatha seemed to still be training.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She works even harder than I do." Osborne hesitated, unsure whether to wake Agatha from her training.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that moment, Agatha opened the door.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Did you finish your training too?" As he spoke, Osborne suddenly froze, staring at Agatha in surprise. "Did you break through to Empyrean Sacredness?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From the time they began training until now, more than two months had passed in the outside world. But with a hundredfold time acceleration, they had been training for over seventeen years. Osborne and Agatha did not interfere with each other, as the rooms were covered by an energy defense system.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This meant Osborne hadn't seen Agatha for over a decade.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hadn't expected Agatha to have already broken through to Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, it seemed she had done more than just break through to Empyrean Sacredness. Her Sacred Power was immensely powerful at this moment. With his heightened perception, Osborne noticed that Agatha's Sacred Power clearly contained many different types of forces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After carefully sensing, he discovered there were as many as six types of forces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You not only broke through to Empyrean Sacredness but also fused six types of forces?" Osborne was shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha smiled, nodded, and said, "Yes. I was lucky, so I broke through. I don't even know why I could fuse six types of forces. I feel that after breaking through to Empyrean Sacredness, fusing forces became much easier. So, I quickly fused three new forces."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Agatha carefully examined Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Compared to Osborne's earlier surprise, she now felt shocked. She sensed that Osborne had completely changed, even his aura had undergone a significant transformation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had become more handsome and mysterious. At this moment, she couldn't sense the extent of Osborne's strength at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was as unfathomable as an abyss, impossible to explore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha said, "You seem to have changed a lot too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "I've made some progress. But compared to you breaking through Empyrean Sacredness and merging six powers, I'm far behind, completely no match for you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne felt a bit helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gave it his all, using a large amount of Elven Sacred Water, barely managing to merge five powers. He thought this was already remarkable, but Agatha's progress was even greater&mdash;she not only broke through Empyrean Sacredness but also merged six powers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the difficulty of merging powers before breaking through Empyrean Sacredness is different from after. Osborne merging five powers before breaking through Empyrean Sacredness was unprecedented, and its difficulty was far greater than Agatha merging six powers after breaking through.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, many warriors at Empyrean Sacredness can merge six powers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm planning to join the zone duel next," Osborne said. "So, I'll be leaving Mystic Sirius Sect for a while. Do you want to stay here and continue training, or leave with me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha hesitated for a moment. She bit her lower lip and said, "I'll stay here and continue training. The zone duel is a grand event. By then, many prominent figures will surely attend, and there might be people hunting me among them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even with the Sublime Concealment Orb, I can't guarantee I won't be discovered by them. So, I won't go. I want to keep training, improve my strength quickly, and avenge the Ember Phoenix Clan."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, a hint of killing intent flashed in Agatha's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and said, "That works too. I'll only be gone for about ten days. Once the zone duel is over, I'll come back. I'll keep the time here accelerated by a hundred times to help with your training."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you," Agatha said gratefully.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without Osborne's time acceleration, she wouldn't have been able to break through to Empyrean Sacredness so quickly, nor fuse the six powers so rapidly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This way, her wish to avenge the Ember Phoenix Clan would become even more distant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, "Then keep training. If you need anything, contact me anytime through the terminal."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay," Agatha said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After bidding farewell to Agatha, Osborne left his residence to report to Angela.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Actually, he really wanted to spar with Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His gains this time were truly immense. But he hadn't had a suitable opponent to test just how strong he had become.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt that Agatha, who had advanced to primary Empyrean Sacredness and fused six types of powers, would be a good opponent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne ultimately gave up on this idea because he felt that if Agatha didn't use the power of Dark Phoenix, she definitely wouldn't be a match for him and wouldn't even pose much of a challenge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though Agatha had advanced to Empyrean Sacredness and fused six types of powers, Osborne still had absolute confidence that he could easily defeat her, unless she used the power of Dark Phoenix.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, if that happened, Agatha being the Dark Phoenix would likely be exposed, bringing her unimaginable danger and possibly being hunted again by ten top warriors at the Empyrean Sacredness level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, no warrior from the Ember Phoenix Clan would risk their life to protect her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne ultimately abandoned the idea of competing with Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although it might be difficult, I hope to encounter a few decent opponents in the zone duel. This could make the fight a bit more enjoyable and allow me to take it a bit more seriously." Thinking confidently, Osborne arrived outside Angela's residence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knocked on the door. Soon, the door opened. Angela looked at Osborne with great surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When did you arrive? Why didn&rsquo;t I sense anything at all? Why do I feel like you&rsquo;ve changed somehow? I can&rsquo;t see through you at all anymore." Angela was utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne at this moment was completely different from before. He looked incredibly handsome, exuding a calm and mysterious aura, as if he were a deep abyss.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela even felt a bit of pressure from Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "I just gained a little something."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly changed the subject. "There are six days left until the Zone Duel begins. You said we should go five days early, so here I am."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne carefully observed Angela, unable to hide his surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the past, Angela gave Osborne an unfathomable feeling, as if she were a towering mountain with no visible peak, impossible for him to conquer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Osborne realized Angela wasn&rsquo;t that strong after all. She was only at mid Empyrean Sacredness. After merging seven powers, her Sacred Power's intensity was decent but not extraordinary.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "Why do I feel that with all my means, I might be able to fight Ms. Olsen now? Even if I can't win, I probably wouldn't lose either."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This feeling made Osborne find it incredibly fascinating. He now actually wanted to challenge the once-invincible Angela in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Has my strength already reached this level?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Osborne suppressed his fighting spirit and didn&rsquo;t actually challenge Angela.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela had no idea what Osborne was thinking. Otherwise, she might have been startled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She just nodded and said, "You're right. We'll head over early tomorrow to prepare for the zone duel. Osborne, are you ready?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
