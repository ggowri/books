  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted coldly, and his ocular energy instantly enveloped a large area in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every bullet that left the barrel was captured by the ocular energy, halting in mid-air, with not a single one able to approach Osborne's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enforcement team members were stunned by this sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression was indifferent, with a hint of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When his Satan's Eye had reached level three, it had gained abilities similar to mind control. This power was already exposed, and there was no need to hide it anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using mind control to deal with bullets was child's play for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He activated his mind control, and the densely packed bullets fell to the ground with a series of clinking sounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the enforcement team members stopped firing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They understood that continuing to shoot would be a waste of bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked at Osborne with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne took a step forward, they all took a step back in unison, their previous arrogance and pride replaced by panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew well that this world respected power above all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, a group of people, led by Donna, emerged from the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's happening here? Who's shooting?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What on earth is going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna asked urgently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind her were Barlyn, Clarissa, and a handsome young man in his mid-twenties who exuded the air of a societal elite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Donna Radcliffe, they were the ones who fired the shots!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Violet stepped forward and quickly recounted the events, detailing how the enforcement team had arrogantly blocked Osborne and even fired at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna's face instantly turned grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at Osborne before turning to the young man and saying coldly, "Mr. Chevalier, your people are way out of line! This is the Radcliffe Manor, a sacred private domain. Osborne is our head of security, and not only did your men block him, but they also fired at him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo smiled faintly and said, "Ms. Donna Radcliffe, it was just a misunderstanding."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then took a serious look at Osborne and smiled, "A Class C+ mind control metahuman, not bad at all! It seems the Radcliffe family hasn't completely declined over the years, being able to find a Class C+ mind control metahuman to be Clarissa's head of security. I'm quite surprised."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Donna's expression turned somewhat sour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could easily detect the mockery in Apollo's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo was implying that the Radcliffe family had declined to the point of being unable to protect Clarissa without hiring an outsider, a mere Class C+ mind control metahuman as the head of security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna was furious inside, clenching her fists but unable to refute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Donna Radcliffe, don't be upset."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo continued, "Since I'm back, such attacks will naturally not happen again. I'm now the captain of the Mayby City enforcement team, and I will send people to protect Clarissa personally from now on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think your security team is unnecessary. It's just a waste of money. Since Clarissa is my fianc&eacute;e, I have the responsibility and obligation to protect her. From now on, let me personally take care of her safety."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Clarissa's face changed instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That won't be necessary!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa said urgently, "Mr. Chevalier, your status is noble. I wouldn't dare trouble you to protect me. If there's nothing else, Mr. Chevalier, please leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced worriedly at Osborne after speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo raised an eyebrow. "Is that so? Very well, but I'm still concerned about your safety, Clarissa. I'll leave some of my bodyguards to protect you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't refuse, or I'll be displeased."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo finished speaking with an air of arrogance as if his displeasure would spell trouble for everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa opened her mouth as if wanting to refuse again but was stopped by Donna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since it's Mr. Chevalier's kind offer, Clarissa, don't refuse! Mr. Chevalier's security team consists of highly trained experts brought in from abroad with extensive experience in combat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With their protection, your safety is assured."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa frowned, wanting to speak up, but ultimately held back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo nodded with a smile. "That settles my concerns!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then selected six female bodyguards. "You six, from now on, protect my fianc&eacute;e Clarissa diligently. If anything happens to her, you will pay with your lives!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Chevalier!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The six women bowed immediately, their faces cold and robotic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone could sense the strong, murderous, and bloody aura from these six women. They were undoubtedly seasoned killers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Apollo said, "Ms. Donna Radcliffe, Clarissa, I'll take my leave now! I will soon discuss our wedding plans with Sir Radcliffe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope our wedding will take place soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think, Clarissa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo finished with a smile, causing Clarissa's face to turn pale. She bit her lip tightly, her expression growing colder without saying a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face also changed dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Discussing wedding plans?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The wedding will take place soon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo and Clarissa were getting married?!</span></p><div class="pagination">
