  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Apocalypse Harbinger spoke to Osborne, he raised his chin slightly, exuding an air of superiority, as if offering </span><span>Osborne</span><span> the chance to submit was a grand favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surrounding them, Nelson, Emperor Dare, and the others exchanged cold, mocking glances, clearly unfazed by Apocalypse Harbinger's arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nelson said, "Esteemed Apocalypse Harbinger, how generous of you to offer him a chance to bow down! Honestly, we should just kill him right here and now to eliminate any future threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if he does submit, he must be kept on a short leash&mdash;no high rank, no chance to </span><span>rebel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apocalypse Harbinger chuckled at this. "Rest assured, anyone who submits to Lord Malevolence is incapable of rebellion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a chilling smile, he continued, "I'll give you ten seconds to think it over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Submit... or die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a self-assured demeanor, Apocalypse Harbinger began his countdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliot, still in Osborne's grasp, couldn't help but smirk, his eyes glinting with malice. "</span><span>Rosmandi's</span><span> Godfather? Look at you now, facing a life-or-death choice. Between annihilation and submission, I can't wait to see what you pick!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle at Eliot's taunts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring him, he fixed his gaze on Lord Malevolence and spoke with conviction. "Who gave you the audacity to make me choose? You think you're worthy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't choose death, nor will I submit. I choose to wipe you all out and send you straight to hell! And it starts with him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne's grip tightened, and with a sickening crack, he snapped Eliot's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock and disbelief washed over everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliot's eyes widened in horror, then confusion, as he realized what had just happened. He opened his mouth to protest, but blood poured from Eliot's lips, silencing him forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His head lolled to the side&mdash;he was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere shifted dramatically. Even Apocalypse Harbinger, who had been counting down, stood momentarily speechless, his mouth agape in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eliot was his bargaining chip! Did he just kill his hostage? Is he out of his mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A stunned silence enveloped the crowd until, moments later, the members of Lord League finally snapped back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes burned with rage as they glared at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! He killed Mr. Monaghan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get him! Avenge Mr. Monaghan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, over sixty warriors from Lord League surged toward Osborne, their faces twisted with fury, eager to tear him apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apocalypse Harbinger merely scoffed, making no move to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I gave you a chance to live, but you threw it away! If you want to die, then by all means, go ahead! Let's see how you plan to take us all down. You think you can even take out these useless warriors from Lord League? Prove it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Apocalypse Harbinger crossed his arms, a cruel smile appearing on his face as he prepared to watch the spectacle unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nelson and Emperor Dare shared his amusement, convinced that the Lord League's warriors were more than capable of handling Osborne without their assistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that moment, Eddie and the other members of the Prophet Alliance exchanged </span><span>worried glances. Without hesitation, they rushed toward Osborne, ready to help him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather, watch out!" Eddie shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne surveyed the charging warriors, a cold smile crept across his face. He casually discarded Eliot's lifeless body and sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord League, you've betrayed humanity, and now it's time for you to pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that declaration, Osborne vanished from sight, reappearing behind one of the Superior Deities from Lord League, unleashing a powerful kick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the Superior Deity of the Lord League exploded, turning into a bloody mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the other warriors could react, Osborne vanished again, appearing behind another Superior Deity and delivering a casual yet devastating kick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another Superior Deity's Divine Body shattered, leaving nothing but scattered fragments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then came the third, fourth, and fifth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their numbers &mdash;over sixty warriors&mdash;the Lord League's members couldn't even touch the hem of Osborne's robe. Several Superior Deities fell in rapid succession, incapable of withstanding even a single blow from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every Divine Body, regardless of its strength, exploded into a crimson haze upon contact with Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His attacks were brutal and dominant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne moved like the Grim Reaper, harvesting the lives of the Lord League's warriors in an unstoppable frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie and the others, who had intended to rush to Osborne's aid, froze in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the onlookers&mdash;Apocalypse Harbinger, Nelson, and Emperor Dare&mdash;were momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Incredible strength! A single kick shatters a Superior Deity's Divine Body! Even I would struggle to match that feat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what's that... Temporal Stasis?!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
