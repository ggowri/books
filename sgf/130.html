  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard, what nonsense are you talking about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna scolded upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa is your cousin. You won't protect her yourself and expect others to? How did I give birth to someone like you? Go reflect on yourself immediately!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, don't expect to get a penny from me in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn frowned and retorted, "Resigning as the bodyguard captain doesn't mean I won't protect Clarissa. I just don't want to handle those trivial matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can still protect Clarissa! As for the money? If you don't want to give it, then don't. Anyway, I've decided. I must resign."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You brat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna got furious and was about to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, Clarissa held her back. "Aunt Donna, I think Barlyn is right. He can still protect me even if he is not the bodyguard captain. I agree with his resignation. He is my cousin. Having him as my bodyguard captain makes me uncomfortable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You, you two?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna looked at Clarissa and Barlyn, shaking with anger but helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Barlyn well. Once he made up his mind, nothing could change it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Clarissa...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once she decided on something, she was even more stubborn than Barlyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna quickly thought it over and glanced at Osborne. Her frown was deepening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Let Osborne be the bodyguard captain?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't worry about Osborne harming Clarissa. She was just worried that Osborne might have other intentions towards Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he became the bodyguard captain, he would have more time to be with Clarissa. They would be inseparable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She feared something might happen between Osborne and Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was something she absolutely could not accept.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was also something the Radcliffe family would absolutely not accept.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with Barlyn insisting on resigning, was there a better choice than Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least not for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Donna felt a bit powerless and said, "Osborne is not a professional bodyguard. What if he can't lead the team well?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I'm not a professional bodyguard either. Why don't you worry about me? You can't be so biased. Besides, the members of the Personal Guards and the deputy captains will all cooperate with Osborne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna snorted. "How do you know they will cooperate? You are Clarissa's cousin. It's different. The members of the Personal Guards and the deputy captains will naturally cooperate with you and respect you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Osborne just joined the bodyguard team less than a week ago! Promoting him to deputy captain was already exceptional. If he becomes the captain directly, will the other members accept it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Barlyn frowned and couldn't think of a rebuttal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was indeed a problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was not a professional bodyguard. If the deputy captains and other bodyguards didn't respect him or cooperate with his work...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He definitely wouldn't do well as the bodyguard captain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn could only say to Osborne, "Osborne, say something. You have to save me. You must take the position of bodyguard captain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was ecstatic inside but had a wry smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What can I say? Even if I say I can do it well, Ms. Donna Radcliffe might not believe me. Since Ms. Donna Radcliffe thinks the deputy captains won't respect me or cooperate, let's call them together and decide by voting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, Donna's expression changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Voting? That's a good idea! Besides Osborne, three deputy captains are Harris, Violet, and Sharon. I'll agree if two of them vote for Osborne as the captain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If not, then Barlyn continues as the captain!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn hesitated for a moment but then nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay! I trust Osborne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Harris, Violet, and Sharon were called to the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna said, "Everyone, Barlyn has decided to resign as captain. I have decided to select a new captain. Currently, the four of you deputy captains have the opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I want you to vote to decide who will be the captain! You can vote for yourself or someone else. Whoever gets the most votes will be the new bodyguard captain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Barlyn panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, that's not what you just said. If we vote like this, they'll definitely vote for themselves. Osborne won't have a chance. Didn't you say we'd only vote for..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna said, "Now, start voting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris, Violet, and Sharon exchanged glances. They all looked surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all had the opportunity to become the captain?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, all three were tempted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath, looking serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't expect Donna to play this trick. She gave Harris, Violet, and Sharon a chance to become the captain. Why would they vote for anyone else?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would definitely vote for themselves!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under these circumstances, it was almost impossible for Osborne to get two out of the three votes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to do something.</span></p><div class="pagination">
