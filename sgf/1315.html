As a Superior Deity, he surpassed Terrence in every aspect, making the victory seem like an adult overpowering a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence was dazed, unable to utter a single word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't the defeat that frightened him but the sheer devastation of it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't even a Celestial Deity; he was a Superior Deity, yet he crushed Terrence so thoroughly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This battle had shattered every ounce of confidence Terrence had painstakingly built over the centuries of his existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head and turned to Divine Shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandma Divine Shadow, you said you wanted to handle him personally. He's all yours now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow nodded, glancing at the defeated Terrence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could empathize with his broken spirit. Had she been in his place, she might have been equally crushed, feeling life wasn't worth living.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing Osborne's overwhelming prowess, she understood Terrence's despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow spoke. "Terrence, you were once a formidable leader. Even in death, I'll offer you dignity. End it yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence trembled at her words, finally snapping back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wry smile spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"End it myself? What dignity is that? If I must die, it will be in battle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned his gaze to Osborne, a resigned calm replacing his earlier rage and defiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to die by his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You called me a formidable leader, and I've faced countless geniuses, but I've never encountered anyone as terrifying and hopelessly brilliant as him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he doesn't fall, he'll become a Deity King at the very least, perhaps even surpassing the likes of the God of Night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I believe he could become stronger than any Deity King and even transcend that realm."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence's eyes flickered with envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued, "This was my youthful ambition, a dream I soon realized was unattainable. No one could achieve it&mdash;or so I thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now, I believe he can.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So I choose to die by his hand. It's the greatest respect you can offer to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination, Terrence struggled to his feet, divine power flaring around him one last time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, come and finish me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow was taken aback by Terrence's words but found herself agreeing internally with the sentiment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also thought Osborne was destined for greatness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She urged, "Osborne, grant his wish. Though I yearn to end him myself out of hatred, I believe he should fall by your hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That way, when you become the world's strongest warrior someday, his death will have some honor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at them both in surprise but nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Terrence, since you wish to die by my hand, I will oblige.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't fault me for destroying the Deschanel Clan&mdash;it was your clan that ignited this conflict.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In war, there's no right or wrong, only life or death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne vanished, appearing instantly before Terrence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence met Osborne's gaze and murmured, "In war, there's no right or wrong. You're right; this is fate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those final words, Terrence launched a feeble punch at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Weakened by his grave injuries, the attack lacked any real force&mdash;a mere Junior Deity could have easily dodged it. Yet, it was Terrence's last effort, his final act of defiance, and he gave it everything he had left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, out of respect, chose not to evade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence's fist made a soft thud against Osborne, and a bittersweet smile formed on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forgive me, my kin of the Deschanel Clan. I'm coming to join you now..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, he closed his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same moment, Osborne's own fist struck Terrence with decisive force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence's Divine Body shattered, his soul obliterated, leaving no trace behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once-great patriarch of the Deschanel Clan, a warrior who had reached the pinnacle of Deity Overlord, fell at Osborne's hands. Without a Cosmic Treasure like the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, there was no hope of revival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus ended the reign of a formidable ruler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deschanel Clan, an illustrious divine clan from the Age of Gods, vanished into the annals of history with Terrence's passing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a slow breath, an inexplicable heaviness settling on his shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as though an unseen burden weighed on his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will my Augustine family meet the same fate one day?" he wondered.</span></p><div class="pagination">
