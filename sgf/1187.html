  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Satan's Eye, having assimilated the core power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, did far more than just break through to Level Eight, unlocking the power of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It underwent a comprehensive transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every ability of Satan's Eye was massively enhanced. With each ascension of Satan's Eye, Osborne's capabilities soared to unimaginable heights, each step a leap into the extraordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level One mushroomed his vision, granting him the Super Vision. It was like he had got Hawk-Eye tech implanted in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level Two's gift of X-ray vision made his eyes his new superpower. Seeing right through walls, concrete, bones, heck, even souls; there was no hiding from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level Three bestowed godly control over the matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level Four triggered the Devil's Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Level Five, Osborne's artful illusions blurred the line between reality and fantasy. "With these projections, I can create a reality of my choosing. It's like I'm playing with a god's paintbrush."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level Six's Memory Control turned his will into a weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Level Seven unleashed Temporal Stasis, freezing time in its tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These powers saw improvements far exceeding normal upgrades, and they were truly revolutionary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine eyes, known for their formidable vision, paled in comparison to Osborne's Satan's Eye, especially when considering that super vision was merely its most basic function.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Satan's Eye was a supreme power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unfortunately, after breaking through to Level Eight, the rate at which Satan's Eye </span><span>absorbs the core energy of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity has slowed down. Even with ample core energy, breaking through to Level Nine will take a considerable amount of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, for now, it's more than sufficient!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My Memory Control has vastly improved. I now have the confidence to manipulate Cain's memories when taking him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's time to make my move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart surged with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the second stage of fusion between the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity and Osborne's body was finally complete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The countless tiny roots of the Lotus had penetrated every organ, tissue, and cell in his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mystical connection was established.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if his body were utterly destroyed and reduced to nothingness, as long as his soul remained intact, the Lotus could resurrect him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though this resurrection ability had a limited count of about a hundred times, it was enough for Osborne, who was inherently cautious and not easily prone to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne closed his eyes, feeling the transformation within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a short span, his strength had skyrocketed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before descending into the underground, he was merely a top-tier Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he was a Junior Deity. He had obtained the Cosmic Treasure, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, and completed the second stage of fusion with it, becoming the true progenitor of the Blood Clan and gaining an initial grasp of immortality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had also refined perfect Divine Bone and Divine Flesh using the core energy of the Lotus, creating an incredibly powerful Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although his Divine Body's Ethereal Glow was transparent, resembling that of a Waste Divine Body, only Osborne knew that his Divine Body was anything but wasted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was immensely powerful, possibly surpassing even Level Six Divine Bodies and rivaling Level Seven Solar Divine Bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His physical strength had multiplied exponentially compared to before entering the underground. He could now crush any Junior Deity and even outmatch most Intermediate Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he harnessed the core energy of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to elevate both his dark elemental essence and space elemental essence to Level Five. Thus, he grasped the Level Five Realm, which was typically reserved for Superior Deities or even Transcendent Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's dark elemental techniques had been graced with newfound powers&mdash;the Nightshade Wings and the Abyssal Spiral.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His space elemental arsenal had likewise expanded with the completion of Space Collapse and the acquisition of the elusive Phantom Steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These new power techniques transformed what was once Osborne's weakness into a formidable strength. The true extent of his prowess remained to be tested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most significantly, his dark and space elemental essences continued to absorb the core energy of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, constantly evolving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wouldn't be long before they reached the peak of Level Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furthermore, his Satan's Eye, fueled by the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity's core energy, had surged to Level Eight, enhancing his powers comprehensively. Osborne now also wielded the formidable time power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Contemplating this, even Osborne himself felt like a monster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was just a recent breakthrough Junior Deity, yet his grasp of these abilities surpassed those of Intermediate Deities, Superior Deities, and even Transcendent Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of these powers could enable him to triumph over adversaries of higher realms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, just how potent was he now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne himself had no definite answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He longed for a genuine battle with an Intermediate Deity, or even a Superior Deity, to gauge his true limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alas, such an opportunity eluded him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sighing deeply, Osborne eventually gazed at Cain with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that my strength has reached its zenith, it's high time to eradicate the God of Sin, Cain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man is a colossal threat, privy to too many of my secrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until Cain is eliminated, I can never rest easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, let's get this done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without further ado, Osborne activated the Breath of Celestial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This unique ability was his only means to harness the power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity!</span></p><div class="pagination">
