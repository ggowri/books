  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Three days later, there were two days left until Godfather's eightieth birthday banquet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was the day of the Branch Bloodline Competition of the Augustine family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, it became quite lively at Mount Seven. During this time, people were arriving from the nine branch bloodlines of the Augustine family, and everyone was preparing in silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because the Branch Bloodline Competition could mean so much to anyone from the branch bloodlines of the Augustine family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the Branch Bloodline Competition was over, the rankings of the nine branch bloodlines would be published.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If the branch bloodlines got a higher ranking, the more resources they could get from the main bloodlines every year, and the higher their implicit status in the Augustine family would be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Furthermore, the top two of the Branch Bloodline Competition could become the recognized heirs of the Augustine family, and they would even have a chance to become the leader in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Each of the nine branch bloodlines of the Augustine family wanted these two places.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because the status of recognized heirs was pretty high.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were only four recognized heirs in the main bloodlines of the Augustine family, namely Vincent, Matthew, Owen and Emma, who were the most gifted members of the young generation of the main bloodlines, and each of them was extremely powerful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their position in the Augustine family was comparable to that of the leader.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as they became recognized heirs, they would get the best training, the best teachers to guide them, and the most resources. People from the main bloodlines would fulfill almost everything they want.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, everyone would like to be a recognized heir.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Branch Bloodline Competition would start in the afternoon, but it was just dawn, and various people from branch bloodlines were already making all sorts of preparations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They went around to ask what form this Branch Bloodline Competition would take. Would it be an arena contest, capturing the flag in the wild, or something else?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately, they couldn't find out anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, the main bloodlines of the Augustine family were even looking forward to this Branch Bloodline Competition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't until noon that news finally came in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Wise Order had decided that the place for the Branch Bloodline Competition would be in the Lostridge Mountains, just north of Newport City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is the location of the competition in the Lostridge Mountains?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It seems like this Branch Bloodline Competition is going to take the form of capturing the flag in the wild. This is the worst news for us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isaac looked furious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Isaac learned that Osborne was going to compete in the Branch Bloodline Competition, which not only concerned the rankings of the branch bloodlines, but he was also competing for the identity of the recognized heirs, he left what he was doing in Dampston and immediately rushed to Newport City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isaac knew that he couldn't really help much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If participants wanted to take part in the Branch Bloodline Competition, the minimum requirements were that they should be no older than forty-five years old and that their state needed to be at Class A level.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nobody from the branch bloodline of the Augustine family in Dampston had met the requirements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Therefore, Osborne had to fight alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They wished that the Branch Bloodline Competition would be an arena contest, with one-on-one fights to level the playing field, so that Osborne's chances would be maximized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But unfortunately, the final Branch Bloodline Competition was to capture the flag in the wild.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As far as they knew, there were at least a few people, and as many as a dozen, who were eligible to enter in the other eight branch bloodlines.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In capturing the flag in the wild, they would perfectly team up to help their heirs to a better result, but Osborne was just alone. Even if he was formidable, how would he compete with people from other branch bloodlines for the rankings?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, it looks like we're only going to be ranked ninth."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isaac looked pessimistic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While Isaac knew Osborne was powerful, the other eight branch bloodlines of the Augustine family were not simple, far from what they were now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Isaac, this is all our fault! If we had worked a little harder and reached Class A earlier, we could have helped Osborne by now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nathan felt remorseful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Kaden, Queenie, and even Yulissa were blaming themselves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you guys talking about?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Osborne's calm voice suddenly rang out, and everyone suddenly looked over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, you've finally finished your retreat."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yulissa ran over and glanced up and down at Osborne, and she thought that Osborne seemed a little different. His skin became more delicate and smoother, his cheeks became angular, and he looked more handsome.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yulissa blushed at the thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled and nodded, stroking Yulissa's head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He greeted Isaac and asked, "The Branch Bloodline Competition is starting soon, right? Any new information?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After he asked, everyone fell silent and looked lost.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Osborne realized what was going on, he couldn't help but laugh at once.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Capture the flag in the wild? Isn't that a good thing? What I'm best at is fighting in the wild, and if it were an arena battle, I would feel constrained instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You guys should be cheerful. I still have a chance."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone still couldn't be happy when they heard it and felt that Osborne was trying to comfort them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was left to fight alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the contrary, the other eight branch bloodlines of the Augustine family would have many helpers, even a dozen helpers for them. In such a situation, how could Osborne have any chance of defeating them?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Forget it. It's our first time competing in the Branch Bloodline Competition, so just take it as a way to gain experience," Isaac said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nathan, tell Osborne carefully what you've learned about the other eight branch bloodlines' participation, so he can prepare in advance."</p><div class="pagination">
