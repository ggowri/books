  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two gasps echoed in the room, one from Tristan and the other from his father, Seth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both men were taken aback upon hearing Osborne mention his mother's name, their eyes wide with shock as they turned to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a surge of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You both know my mother? She's part of the Hudson family, isn't she?" His voice trembled with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tristan and Seth exchanged glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seth's earlier anger had melted away, replaced by a mix of excitement and disbelief, tinged with a hint of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They both worried this could be a misunderstanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, it was Seth who spoke up, "Yes, there is indeed a Vivienne in the Hudson family. She's our little princess, my sister! But whether your mother is the same Vivienne, I can't say for sure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is she? And what about your dad? If you bring them here, we'll know for certain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seth struggled to contain his excitement, his gaze fixed on Osborne, mirroring Osborne's eagerness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne's expression dimmed at Seth's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know where my mother is. I thought... she was here with the Hudson family! But from what you're saying, your sister Vivienne isn't here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seth said, "What do you mean you don't know where she is? You're right! My sister Vivienne has been missing for over twenty years! She left when she was just twenty, and she's never returned!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Seth's brow furrowed in concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Over twenty years? Left at twenty?" Osborne murmured, quickly calculating the timeline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne had departed from the Blue Planet, he was roughly twenty-six years old. Then, he was swept into the spatial anomalies, spending two decades adrift in deep space before finally reaching Celestara. Considering the time he'd spent there, it had been almost a year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, in total, he must be around forty-seven years old now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seth's sister Vivienne had left the Hudson family over twenty years ago at the age of twenty, meaning she was only in her forties now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he considered the ages alone, it seemed unlikely she could be his mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the reality was far more complex than simple arithmetic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time in Celestara was chaotic and didn't align with the flow of time on Blue Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A millennium ago, Lord Malevolence invaded Celestara, nearly obliterating it and wiping out ninety percent of the Human Community. The scent of death filled the air, making Celestara a perilous place for ordinary life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In response, the God of Space, one of the Seven Great Deity Kings, forcibly severed a portion of Celestara and sealed it away&mdash;that was Blue Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, the God of Time accelerated the passage of time on the Blue Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A year in Celestara could translate to millions of years on the Blue Planet, making the flow of time there millions of times faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until the reincarnation of the God of Time, Ophelia, regained her memories that time on Blue Planet returned to normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne pieced together his mother Vivienne's life in his mind, he envisioned her first twenty years in Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the little princess of the Hudson family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For reasons unknown, she had left Celestara at twenty, journeying to Blue Planet, where she met and fell in love with Theodore, ultimately giving birth to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, Vivienne and Theodore had been pursued and attacked by Emperor Dare of Blue Planet, forcing them to return to Celestara through a dimensional portal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything began to make sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the Vivienne from the Hudson family really is my mother..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath, trying to steady his racing heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed to confirm whether the Vivienne they spoke of was truly his mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought for a moment, then activated the dimensional portal to Hope Haven, reaching out to Anastasia. He had to find out for sure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that a Dimensional Microcosm you're carrying?" Seth asked, a hint of surprise in his voice as he watched Osborne, unsure of what his intentions were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a figure stepped through the swirling portal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Anastasia, but she had transformed herself to resemble Vivienne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she emerged, both Seth and Tristan turned to her, their eyes widening in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vivienne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Vivienne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exclaimed in unison, shock and excitement coursing through them. They trembled visibly, especially Seth, whose tears began to flow freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vivienne! You're finally back! Do you have any idea how worried Dad has been? How much we've missed you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seth's voice was thick with emotion as he tried to sit up, but his weakened body betrayed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could barely manage to lift himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood frozen, absorbing the scene unfolding before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reactions of Seth and Tristan confirmed it&mdash;his mother, Vivienne, was indeed the Vivienne of the Hudson family, Seth's sister and Tristan's aunt!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a revelation that sent his thoughts racing, especially considering the age difference between his mother and Seth, who was significantly older, even older than Tristan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "So, Seth is my uncle?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Tristan is my cousin?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've finally found my mother's roots! I've found her family!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
