  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa's face contorted with shock. When she realized her petrification power couldn't restrict his movements and was effortlessly neutralized by his martial art aura, she could no longer maintain her composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't fear. She snorted coldly and dodged swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her speed was incredible, as fast and agile as a cheetah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her bare skin quickly sprouted fine animal fur. Then, she even ran on all fours like a beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's punch missed, and he couldn't help but be amazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Medusa No. 7 dodge like a beast, he felt the world was somewhat magical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shape-shifting power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa No. 7 sneered, "Do you think you can defeat me just because you can resist my petrification? Naive. I'm not one of those weaklings who only use their powers and are helpless when a martial artist gets close!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was born for war, a perfect evolution of humanity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she did not retreat but instead charged at Osborne. She lunged forward, her sharp claws gliding across Osborne's neck like a blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was too fast! She was incredibly swift!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't dodge in time and was instantly scratched by her claws. Fortunately, his martial art aura protected him from harm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But a crack appeared in his martial art aura at the neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impressive strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was even more astonished, his expression grave. Medusa No. 7 not only had the Class A Power Master's petrification power, but her strength was also on par with a Class A martial master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa's first attack didn't kill Osborne, but she remained calm. A cold light shot from her eyes, attempting to petrify Osborne. Although it was doomed to fail, it would still restrict his movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she launched a second attack. She used her sharp claws to lunge at Osborne again, aiming for his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, she gave Osborne the impression of a powerful and beautiful cheetah pouncing on her prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You do have some skills, but to kill me, you're still far from it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne now took the fight seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally activated Satan's Eye, and Medusa's terrifying speed became slow in his eyes, at least slow enough for him to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Layers of stone skin appeared on his body, but he didn't care and punched out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Medusa No. 7 was blown away, but it didn't cause her much lethal damage. She flipped lightly and stabilized her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, her eyes shot out the petrifying light again, and she lunged at Osborne once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, against the petrification power, blew her away time and time again. The battle intensified, and the sea surface churned into huge waves, but it didn't affect them at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa No. 7's face finally became grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She found that even though she exerted all her strength, she still couldn't cause harm to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's martial art aura had such strong defensive power that it not only blocked her petrification power but never collapsed under her successive attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's attacks landed on her body, causing her immense pain each time. If not for her body's modification that prevented pain signals from reaching her brain, she would have screamed out loud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even so, Osborne's terrifying power still injured her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood trickled from the corner of her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body trembled faintly, a warning sign that she was nearing her limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa No. 7 seethed with anger. She retreated to a distance abruptly, ceasing her assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was also somewhat dissatisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't been holding back, unleashing the full extent of his physical strength, yet he still couldn't defeat Medusa No. 7 after all this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa No. 9 had been taken down in an instant by Serena!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is the gap between Ms. Hernandez and me that vast?" Osborne pondered, his expression suddenly changing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trying to escape? Do you really think you can get away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Osborne tore open a dimensional rift and stepped through. In the next moment, he appeared right in front of Medusa No. 7, who was attempting to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa No. 7's face contorted with anger. A more intense petrification glow burst from her eyes, and she lunged at Osborne with a claw, her body swiftly diving into the ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, her petrification power was exceptionally potent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne finally took a moment to dispel the effects of petrification. Looking at the sea where Medusa No. 7 had vanished, he sneered coldly again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Running into the sea again? Just courting death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne controlled the seawater to part and pursued Medusa swiftly. At this point, she had already reached the seabed, fleeing rapidly in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even so, she wasn't fast enough to escape Osborne, who could command the seawater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, she had fled half a mile on the seabed when Osborne finally caught up to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa No. 7 turned around, her face devoid of fear, only a cold sneer and contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've fallen for it! Come out now! This guy is a bit of a handful. I need your help to deal with him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, four powerful figures appeared around Osborne, trapping him in the center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in alert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Four Class A masters!</span></p><div class="pagination">
