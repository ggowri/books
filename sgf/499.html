  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Clarkson, what happened to you? Why are you looking at me like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a chill run down his spine under Bryce's gaze, thinking something must be wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce quickly cleared his throat to cover his embarrassment and smiled, "It's nothing. I was just a bit shocked. I didn't expect you to have killed Chris and Bruce."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, "I just got lucky. Thanks to you supporting me from the shadows, I was able to fight freely. I will arrange for someone to transfer the ten billion I promised to your account."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce was startled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't. Please don't. I didn't do anything. In fact, I was held up by other matters and just arrived. How could I accept your money?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you give me money, it means you don't treat me like a brother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback by this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bryce doesn't want that money? That's ten billion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Bryce saying he had been delayed and had just arrived, Osborne didn't believe it at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He definitely arrived early. Otherwise, how would he know I killed Chris and Bruce?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Clarkson, this is something we agreed upon long ago. The deal is a deal. I am not someone who breaks promises."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce was terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "If I dare to accept the money, Isa will definitely find me again, and </span><span>Likreia</span><span> Mountain and I will be in trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly said, "No. Since we hit it off, I consider you a brother. If you feel the same, then let's not mention money again, or else I will get angry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce pretended to look angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a long time, finally nodded, and did not mention money again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Clarkson, thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't call me Mr. Clarkson. From now on, I'll call you Osborne, and you'll call me Bryce."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Bryce hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that Osborne and I are brothers, can I address Night Witch by her name? I won't get beaten up for this, will I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce suddenly felt a bit regretful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne already spoke. "Alright, Bryce."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce smiled, but it looked more like a grimace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Clarissa finally returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa curiously examined Bryce, then walked over to Osborne and gently hugged his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce was instantly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked in surprise, "Osborne, who is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and took Clarissa's hand to introduce her. "This is Clarissa, my girlfriend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, this is Bryce, the pirate leader of </span><span>Likreia</span><span> Mountain, the absolute ruler of this sea area. Last time, it was Bryce who saved me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa greeted, "Hello, Bryce."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce was already dumbfounded. He glanced at Osborne, then at Clarissa, his mouth agape in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your girlfriend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Night Witch just told me Osborne is her man, yet Osborne has another girlfriend? Does Night Witch know? She must know. And she actually didn't oppose it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce looked at Osborne with admiration in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne is truly a man. He not only has such a powerful girlfriend like Night Witch, but he also has a second one. Meanwhile, I... As a dignified maritime overlord over forty years old, I still don't have a single girlfriend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Bryce suddenly grabbed Osborne's arm and said seriously, "Osborne, teach me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Teach you what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was confused and didn't understand what Bryce meant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Teach me how to pick up girls. How did you win over such a beautiful Clarissa? And Night... Anyway, you have to teach me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Clarissa blushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, maybe it's because I look relatively handsome?" Osborne replied with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce seriously examined Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne truly was handsome. Especially after breaking through Class A, his charm became even more outstanding, and his tall, strong physique was like that of a statue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I'm not bad either..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce muttered, ultimately saying nothing more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Clarissa, thought for a moment, and then showed a resolute expression. "Osborne, since we are friends, let me give you both a gift."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was extremely surprised to hear this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bryce wants to give us a gift? What could it be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce presented the enormous harpoon in his hand, known as the Trident of Poseidon, to Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Trident of Poseidon has accompanied me for over thirty years. Clarissa, please accept it as my gift to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Bryce forcibly handed the Trident of Poseidon to Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was also left dumbfounded.</span></p><div class="pagination">
