  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was still reeling from the shocking clash between the Creation Herald and the immense root.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying display of power left him feeling hopeless, but in an instant, the Creation Herald had severed the root cleanly in half with just a single strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden realization dawned on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the Creation Herald had battled Icy Nine and the others, he had clearly been holding back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had unleashed his true power back then, none of them would have stood a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is just a projection, an embodiment with the strength of an Ascension Level Five Supernal Deity King! If it were his true body... And what about the God of Night and Lord Malevolence, who managed to escape from him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How powerful could they truly be? And that World Tree offshoot&mdash;if it can even suppress the Creation Herald, its strength must be beyond comprehension."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned deeply, wrestling with the weight of the gravity in this new situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, we've arrived!" the Creation Herald announced suddenly, snapping Osborne from his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grasped Osborne's shoulder and pulled him away from the not-so-powerful spatial flux, materializing in a vast expanse of emptiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here, vivid colors were absent, replaced by the presence of a gigantic, translucent door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald stated, his voice cold as he fixed his gaze on the immense portal, "This is the Chrono-Spatial Gateway!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Crossing through that door will lead us directly to the lair of that ferocious tree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But there's a catch&mdash;it can only be accessed by those with spatial power, and who are not at the Supernal Deity King level. From this point on, it's all on you. I'll be waiting for you outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once you're inside, find the main body of that tree. As soon as you do, draw out the Bloodwrought Bow and activate the three Divine Marks inscribed on it to unleash the Divine Ascendance Technique power. That will be your ticket to injuring the tree's main body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, as fast as you can, get the hell out! As long as you escape the Chrono-Spatial Gateway, I can ensure your safety and bring you back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart raced as he processed the Creation Herald's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reality of standing at the threshold of the World Tree offshoot's lair was daunting, and anxiety gripped him tighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at the enormous translucent portal ahead, swallowing hard as a sense of dread washed over him. The Chrono-Spatial Gateway seemed to emanate a palpable terror, as if a vicious beast lay within, waiting to ensnare him as soon as he dared to step through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Worry gnawed at Osborne's insides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chose to reach out to Primordial in a private exchange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Primordial, we're at the lair of another World Tree offshoot, but I can't shake this feeling of dread. Are we sure about this? You're confident we won't be wiped out the moment we step inside?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's voice resonated calmly in his mind. "Nothing ventured, nothing gained. The risks are necessary in light of the potential rewards! I can assure you, that World Tree offshoot is indeed tied up with someone else. Otherwise, the earlier assault wouldn't have been so feeble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reassurance granted Osborne a flicker of comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll trust your judgment and move forward. If you're not afraid of being swallowed whole, then I reckon I shouldn't be either. Besides, you mentioned before that this tree can't kill me outright!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial warned, "Just be cautious, Osborne. I get the feeling Creation Herald hasn't shared everything with you. There may be a hidden agenda at play."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nodding slightly to himself, Osborne replied, "I'm aware. I'll keep my eyes open."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, he turned to the Creation Herald. "Rest assured, I'll follow your instructions and ensure everything goes smoothly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he began his slow approach toward the Chrono-Spatial Gateway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer size of it was overwhelming. It loomed like a mountain, seemingly close yet endlessly distant. As he finally stood before it, its vastness loomed larger than life, sending a fresh wave of uncertainty coursing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the Chrono-Spatial Gateway hung a shimmering membrane of light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pressed his hand against it, immediately feeling a formidable barrier pushing back at him. He summoned his divine power, unleashing it against the gateway, but it remained unyielding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Creation Herald urged, "Stop wasting your strength! If you could break it open, there'd be no need for you to help me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only by using your spatial power can you get through!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nodding solemnly, Osborne didn't hesitate any longer. He activated his spatial power, and in an instant, he was gripped by a powerful force drawing him toward the Gateway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to cross the threshold, Creation Herald made a sudden move, pulling out a blood-red orb and forcefully placing it in Osborne's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's the real trump card for dealing with that tree!" he said, a twisted smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Startled, Osborne felt a surge of chaotic energy radiating from the red orb in his grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It pulsed as if it were a live wire, and he instinctively wanted to toss it away, but it felt as if it were glued to his palm, resisting any attempt to relinquish it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what's going on here?" Osborne blurted, confusion creeping into his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Creation Herald chuckled, "You really thought the Bloodwrought Bow alone could take down the true body of that tree? Sure, the bow is powerful, and my Divine Marks are no joke, but let's be honest: your strength is too lacking to unleash its full potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, just to be safe, I've prepared this little surprise for you! This is the Bloodstrike Orb, a divine artifact I stumbled upon with my true body. It's a product of the Umbra World, and its explosive force could bring that tree to its knees!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But&mdash;here's the kicker&mdash;you'll be done for too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ever thought about trying to extort me? That's a death wish! You ought to die right here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he gave Osborne a hefty shove.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get in there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fury coursed through Osborne as he processed the betrayal. Creation Herald had been plotting all along. The force of the Chrono-Spatial Gateway gripped him, leaving him unable to fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll regret this, Creation Herald! If I make it out alive, mark my words, I'll make sure you pay!" he shouted as he vanished into the swirling light of the Gateway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Creation Herald stood at the portal, a contemptuous smirk plastered on his face as he watched Osborne disappear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can survive? With the Bloodstrike Orb, neither you nor that tree stands a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once that tree is gone, I'll be free! Ha! No one can hold me down anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes glinted with excitement and anticipation. He was reveling in the thought of freedom as the gateway shimmered closed behind Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne found himself in a vibrant realm, a world bursting with colors and life, stretching endlessly in every direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the center stood an enormous tree, its branches towering toward the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was one of the offshoots of the World Tree, and it loomed like a titan, magnificent and intimidating.</span></p><div class="pagination">
