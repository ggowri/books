  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The grand arena for Osborne's Honor Quest Ceremony was set at Arena Number One, nestled high within Challenge Peak.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This expansive venue comfortably accommodated tens of thousands.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Early that morning, attendees of the ceremony, representatives of prominent superpowers, arrived in droves.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Leading the event was Jackie from the Prophet Alliance, while Wesson stepped in to represent the Augustine family, as their Godfather was unable to attend.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With only one Supreme Overlord in the family, Wesson took it upon himself to maintain order and oversee the proceedings.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd swelled with each passing moment.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Most attendees were young forces from various superpowers, boasting a minimum rank of Class AA, with many reaching Class AAA.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A good number of imposing Class S Supreme Overlords were also present, their mere presence casting a sense of awe and intimidation.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Among them were Rumen from the Thornberry family and Everett from the Rosenthal family.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At least seven or eight Class S powerhouses had appeared, each exuding an overwhelming aura that felt like an abyss, intimidating anyone who dared to come close.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Within this sea of strength, the Secluded Families of Rosmandi had arrived, along with representatives from the thirty-six Divine Families across the globe.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even the Eityreia Organization sent delegates.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The atmosphere in Arena Number One was electric, alive with anticipation and a hint of rivalry.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ha! Ever since I arrived in Rosmandi, that Osborne hasn't shown his face! I hear he's only Class AA? Can you believe the Augustine family is hosting an Honor Quest Ceremony for him? Don't they fear it'll turn into a spectacle of shame?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Right? I'm here just to witness the disaster in the making! Imagine if the Augustine family's big event spirals into a total embarrassment!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Previously, we'd have no chance, but now with Osborne at Class AA, who knows? Maybe one of us could take him down and snag that divine artifact along with 500 billion!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ha! I'll be the first to challenge him! Imagine, taking him down in the very first round! That would be legendary!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Count me in as well! I want that first shot!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd buzzed with mocking chatter, their taunts woven with disdain. Meanwhile, the Augustine family representatives felt the weight of those scornful looks, their expressions darkening with worry.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They sensed the tension building, particularly because the Prophet Alliance hadn't updated the Godson Rankings, still listing Axell at number 205 instead of Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a result, many in attendance were oblivious to Osborne's true strength and were eagerly waiting for a show.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, the atmosphere shifted as whispers rippled through the crowd.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Look, it's Marlon!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Marlon has arrived!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Marlon has a ranking of 40 on the Godson Rankings! But I've heard he's strong enough to break into the top twenty, maybe even the top ten!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Among the younger generation, only Cuthbert ranks higher than him, but rumor has it he's had some setbacks!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Marlon could very well be the strongest young fighter out there! And that woman with him? That's his sister, Ebony&mdash;a powerhouse in her own right at rank 398."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the crowd fixated on Marlon, he strode in with an air of arrogance, his demeanor cold and dismissive.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The pair made their way to front-row seats, instantly commanding attention.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony scoffed, her voice laced with irritation.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That pathetic Osborne has been MIA these past few days! No chance to teach him a lesson! I hope he wins a few matches so I can personally take him down and claim that divine artifact and 500 billion!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marlon chuckled, a glint of confidence in his eyes. "Don't worry. You'll get your shot. If the arena doesn't give you a chance, I'll make sure you have one. Osborne won't escape you forever."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony's face lit up with delight.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, a masked woman settled beside them.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Scarlett glanced at Marlon with a subtle smile. "Marlon, you seem to have gotten stronger. We should find a chance to spar sometime!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marlon regarded Scarlett with a serious expression.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In the ring, you wouldn't stand a chance against me! Out in the wild, though, I couldn't win you."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Scarlett smirked. "So you think in the wild you just can't win me? You're quite confident. I feel different. I may not beat you in the ring, but out there, I could kill you."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marlon snorted dismissively, saying, "Scarlett, you're way too cocky! If you think you can kill me, you're mistaken!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She shrugged, unfazed. "Well, let's just see if we can set something up."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, she turned her attention back to the arena.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By now, everyone who needed to be there had arrived.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jackie stepped into the spotlight, greeting the crowd with a grin. "I declare the Honor Quest Ceremony officially underway!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's welcome today's main star! Osborne!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Jackie announced him, Osborne walked up to the stage with a calm demeanor.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Boo!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ha! What a joke."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Honor Quest Ceremony? More like a shame fest!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't go down in the first match!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Osborne took his place on the stage, the crowd erupted into a chorus of jeers and mockery.</p><div class="pagination">
