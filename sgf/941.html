  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Osborne had swiftly dispatched several Duke </span><span>Taurens</span><span>, in the grand scheme of the battlefield, their deaths hardly mattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had seriously underestimated the horrors of war.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he prepared to unleash another wave of assault to eliminate more foes, they responded with remarkable speed. In an instant, dozens, if not hundreds, of attacks began to rain down upon him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne found himself engulfed on all sides, unable to dodge or evade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His only option was to unleash his martial art aura, trying to shield himself from the incoming onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, Osborne was completely overwhelmed by a torrent of attacks. Although those clones were no match for him in a one-on-one encounter, and Osborne could easily wipe out a single Class AAA clone, the situation changed dramatically when faced with so many foes at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their strikes weren't particularly powerful, and individually, they couldn't breach Osborne's defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when dozens, even hundreds, coordinated their attacks, the dynamics shifted entirely; even someone as formidable as Osborne found himself struggling under the weight of their assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His martial art aura shook violently as it absorbed the barrage, but the sheer volume of attacks overwhelmed him, breaking through his defenses and landing blows on his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Osborne managed to stave off the majority of blows, but blood trickled from the corners of his mouth, and his body bore numerous new wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when Osborne thought it was over, a new wave of attacks surged toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was at this moment he truly grasped the meaning of the phrase "the many can kill the mighty." He could easily dispatch a single Class AAA clone, swiftly deal with ten of them, and even ensnare fifty using his Light Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his current strength, Osborne could also quickly take down an ordinary Class S Supreme Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when faced with hundreds&mdash;thousands&mdash;of clones, even if most were only Class AA, their numbers turned the tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer volume of attacks left him unable to fight back or even defend himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming assault surged forth like a tidal wave, threatening to engulf him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how hard he fought back, Osborne was struggling to hold his ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when things seemed bleak, reinforcements arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From their headquarters, Serena and her team saw Osborne caught in the grasp of the enemy's offensive and quickly mobilized dozens of Class AAA allies to rush to his aid, shielding him from most of the attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, over here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fall back with me!" Serena </span><span>shouted,</span><span> urgency woven into her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As countless attacks rained down on them, it was clear they wouldn't hold out for long. Without hesitation, Osborne dispatched two Duke </span><span>Taurens</span><span> charging at him, then </span><span>dashed over to join his fellow members of Draco Armed Services Branch. Together, they fought their way back to the safety of the headquarters, where sturdy defenses awaited. Only then did Osborne finally let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet the moment came with a heavy price; his body was battered and bruised, his appearance a far cry from the formidable warrior he was known to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena wore a severe expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring Osborne for the moment, she took charge, directing everyone within the headquarters to fend off the Aberrant forces. Chaos reigned, with many already sustaining injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he saw the frantic atmosphere around him, Osborne's expression darkened in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "We can't hold them off!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> has deployed over two thousand Class AA clones at once. This assault is terrifying! And among them, ten Class S clones are still lurking, waiting for their chance to strike. If they decide to engage, we'll be completely overrun..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, piercing screams broke through the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Osborne's horror, he saw two Tauren Kings charging from the left flank of their defenses. In an instant, they crashed into the front line, creating a gaping hole in the barrier. The defenders responsible for the line were sent flying, blood spraying from their mouths as they careened away from the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Members of the Draco Armed Services Branch raced toward the breach, desperate to seal it. But just as they arrived, they were petrified in place, their bodies turning to stone. A series of horrifying claw-like blades followed, slicing through the immobilized figures like paper and claiming lives in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That wasn't all. Two monstrous forms emerged swiftly from the breach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Titan Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their grotesque grins spread wide, they surveyed the remaining defenders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Charge in!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Annihilate them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their cries echoing through the battlefield, the Titans unleashed their fury, further widening the gap in the line. A horde of frenzied clones surged through the opening, filling the air with wild roars as they poured into the headquarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic washed over the defenders, their faces turning ghostly pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The headquarters has been breached!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Relying on the solidity of their defenses, they had managed to stand their ground until now, but with the fortress compromised, how could they hope to prevail against this onslaught?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them all!" The clones screamed as they charged into the heart of the headquarters.</span></p><div class="pagination">
