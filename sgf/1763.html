The warriors below were momentarily captivated, quickly averting their eyes in deference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never expected to see seven exceptionally talented young warriors emerge from the East Zone, setting up a stage to challenge the best of all races. It truly surprises and delights me! They are a treasure for our Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After her declaration, she turned her gaze to the assembled leaders of the various resistance factions, each a formidable warrior in their own right yet humbled in her presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I want to hear your thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"While these young ones are making quite a statement, their actions are also fraught with danger. I believe we should go and bring them back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her words, the room filled with frowns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Esteemed God of Light, I must voice my concerns! Their sudden rise is too suspicious. What they've done is just too unreasonable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"According to our intelligence, they appeared in Wild Flame City just over a month ago, and prior to that, no one knew who they were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their names had never crossed our ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Indeed, they are part of Human Community, and yes, they've defeated Aldrich and Alfred of the Bowman family, but I still suspect this could be a trap!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light raised an eyebrow, and her expression was calm yet curious. "A trap? Please elaborate on your reasoning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's face was grim. "It's precisely because of their incredible talents!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"According to the intelligence, they are all just at the Deity Overlord realm! Most of them are at the peak of the Deity Overlord realm, but there are a few who haven't reached the peak yet. However, in the battle at Wild Flame City, each of them defeated a Deity King warrior! Several of them did it bare-handed, without any divine artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Deity Overlord, bare-handed, defeating a Deity King&mdash;what that means is clear to all of us! Such talent and strength can be described as rare as a phoenix feather or a unicorn's horn in our West Zone, and we can count them on one hand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And yet, in East Zone, seven such individuals suddenly appear!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that reasonable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words echoed through the grand hall, and the leaders of the major resistance organizations in West Zone Human Community all nodded in agreement, acknowledging his point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They, too, found it hard to believe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, God of Light smiled. "Isn't it a good thing for our Human Community to have a few exceptionally talented individuals?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man responded, "Of course, it would be good!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they are truly exceptional geniuses and loyal to Human Community, it would be a tremendous asset for us! If everything is true, even at the cost of heavy sacrifices, we must bring them to West Zone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because it would be worth it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I still believe this is all a scheme! Their talent and strength are 'feigned'! Their achievements are 'fabricated'! This is likely a plot by the Dark Deity tribes. They 'fabricated' seven super geniuses of Human Community to lure us into taking risks in the East Zone, and then they will deal with us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their target is very likely you, the esteemed God of Light!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, there are rumors that Paramount Supreme Clan plans to launch a full-scale attack on us, wiping out all of Human Community in West Zone, and you are their biggest obstacle..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
