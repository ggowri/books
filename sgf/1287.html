  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Evander caught sight of the six Divine Flames flickering above Divine Shadow's head, he was utterly stupefied, disbelief written all over his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? You're a Deity Overlord too?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow let out a cold laugh. "What's so special about being a Deity Overlord? The Deschanel Clan has only one Deity Overlord as its leader, and they think they can act so high and mighty?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back when I brought the Sublime </span><span>Saintess</span><span> to the eastern continent, your lot had the audacity to attack us, kidnap her, and even injure me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now it's my turn to seek revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Deschanel Clan must be wiped out! Even if your leader Terrence woke up right now, he wouldn't be able to save you. After all, the laws of this world are incomplete, at most restoring him to the peak of Transcendent Deity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Divine Shadow finished speaking, Osborne was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandma Divine Shadow, you mean the world's rules are incomplete? It can only restore those ancient gods to the peak of Transcendent Deity?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right! So, Osborne, you don't need to be afraid! You already have the power to take down a Transcendent Deity, which means there aren't many left in this world who can kill you! Even Terrence, who was once at the pinnacle of Deity Overlord strength, is now limited to the same recovery capacity as me&mdash;he can only reach the peak of Transcendent Deity! If it comes to a fight, I'm not scared of him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that really the case? Could it be that the reason my Satan's Eye hasn't broken through Level Nine is because of this incomplete world rule? How can we make the laws of this world whole again and break through beyond Transcendent Deity?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't figure it out, so he set those thoughts aside and turned his icy gaze back to Evander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, your warriors from the Deschanel Clan can only reach the Transcendent Deity level at best? If that's true, then your clan is finished! Once I deal with you, I'll head </span><span>straight for the Deschanel Clan and wipe every last one of you off the map!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold smirk, he glanced over at Divine Shadow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go ahead, Grandma Divine Shadow. He's all yours!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow nodded. "Leave this one to me; he won't cause any more trouble. You go help God of Star. Her opponent is probably looking to bolt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow had reached the peak of Transcendent Deity, which far surpassed Evander's. Evander had only escaped before because Divine Shadow hadn't taken him seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now that she was focused, Evander had no chance at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't hesitate to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the battle between God of Star and Cedric had also reached a critical point. Cedric was severely wounded, completely outmatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like Evander, he attempted to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But God of Star, though perhaps not as powerful as Divine Shadow, was incredibly skilled and focused; her speed was blinding, and she blocked her foe's escape in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne arrived just in time to see the scene unfold&mdash;he didn't even get a chance to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From that point on, things went predictably. In a one-on-one matchup, the Transcendent Deity from the Deschanel Clan stood no chance against Divine Shadow or God of Star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the Divine Bodies of the two Deschanel Clan Transcendent Deities shattered, unleashing an explosion of blood energy that filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasted no time; he quickly began collecting the blood energy pouring around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, both Divine Shadow and the God of Star approached Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star couldn't help but furrow his brow at Osborne's actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow said, "Hey, Osborne. What are you doing gathering all this blood energy? It reminds me of someone&mdash;a real piece of work from the Age of Gods who was hunted down by every Deity King."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne immediately grasped who Divine Shadow was referring to and rubbed the back of his neck in embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandma Divine Shadow, you're talking about Cain, the progenitor of the Blood Clan, aren't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow's eyes widened in surprise. "You know that monster?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment, then nodded. "Not only do I know him, but I've also taken him down! What I'm doing now is indeed reminiscent of Cain's methods because I'm the new progenitor of the Blood Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But don't worry, Grandma Divine Shadow, I won't follow in his wicked footsteps! I'm just collecting this blood energy to help empower my followers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked earnestly at Divine Shadow, who was still processing the revelation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was visibly shocked. "You're the new Blood Clan progenitor? That explains your bizarre and powerful methods! Cain managed to survive when he was being hunted </span><span>by the Deity Kings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then placed a reassuring hand on Osborne's shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I believe you won't turn evil like Cain did! Besides, power itself isn't inherently good or evil; it all depends on how you choose to wield it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got to head back now, but if you're planning to wipe out the Deschanel Clan, you'd better count me in! Terrence injured me and kidnapped the Sublime </span><span>Saintess</span><span>; I want revenge for that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne laughed. "Don't worry, Grandma Divine Shadow, I would've called you anyway. By the way, want me to say hi to Grandpa for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, Divine Shadow's cheeks flushed a deep crimson.</span></p><div class="pagination">
