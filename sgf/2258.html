  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How should we place our bets?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar and Bethan huddled together, their voices barely above a whisper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The buzz around them, filled with praise for Leroy, was starting to weigh heavily on their confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like everyone from Azure Haven Academy was convinced Leroy was a shoo-in for the championship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just how strong was Leroy, really?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't witnessed the grand tournament at Azure Haven Academy, only hearing about the results. They knew Leroy had dominated, defeating Marreese, but the extent of her power remained a mystery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, </span><span>the disciples of Azure Haven Academy</span><span> had witnessed her performance firsthand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their unwavering confidence in Leroy suggested her strength was something to be reckoned with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar and Bethan were all too aware of Marreese and Tyson's capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, with the dark horse Clara from Fantasia Isle and Pero, the third-place contender from Azure Haven Academy, it seemed like Osborne making it into the top five was going to be a tall order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Osborne to secure a spot in the top three, he would need to defeat at least two of Leroy, Marreese, Tyson, or Clara. That felt nearly impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I guess we could just bet on Leroy to win?" Jamar suggested quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bethan retorted, her tone firm, "No way! We're disciples of the Mystic Sirius Sect. How can we bet on the champion of Azure Haven Academy? That's just boosting their ego and crushing our own spirit! If we did that, the Azure Haven folks would laugh at us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, the odds are way too low! Even if Leroy does win, we won't make much Sacred Crystal from it. We should only bet on Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar fell silent at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he clenched his jaw. "Alright, I'll bet on Osborne making it into the top five! The odds are decent, at 3.5 to 1. I'll put down a hundred Sacred Crystals; if I win, that'll turn into 350!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if it doesn't pan out... at least I'm backing our own teammate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bethan's ears perked up at this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She figured betting on Osborne for the top five was the smart play. All Osborne had to do was beat one of Leroy, Marreese, Tyson, Clara, or Pero, and he'd stand a good shot at making it into the top five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, the 3.5-to-1 odds left her a bit underwhelmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then she thought, if they were going to take a risk, they might as well go big.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know what? I'm betting on Osborne making it into the top three! A hundred Sacred Crystals! At the current odds, if he does make it, that'll turn into 2500 Sacred Crystals! The potential payoff is huge. It's worth the risk for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar thought Bethan was being overly optimistic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Getting Osborne into the top three seemed like a real stretch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Bethan was resolute. Once they both made their decisions, they headed to place their bets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? You're betting on Mystic Sirius Sect's Osborne to make the top five? A hundred Sacred Crystals?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're betting on Mystic Sirius Sect's Osborne to make the top three? </span><span>Also</span><span> a hundred Sacred Crystals?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The staff </span><span>member</span><span> </span><span>at the betting booth looked at Jamar and Bethan with wide eyes, as if they were staring at a couple of fools.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surrounding crowd turned their heads, laughter bubbling up as they overheard the bets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! Someone's betting on Mystic Sirius Sect's Osborne to make it into the top three? A hundred Sacred Crystals? Hahaha! This is hilarious! Who would be that foolish? It's like giving money to the casino!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's been a hundred years since Mystic Sirius Sect had anyone in the top three! What makes Osborne think he can do it? How can he possibly defeat Leroy, Marreese, or Tyson?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's just wishful thinking!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me see who's making that bet! Oh, it's the Mystic Sirius Sect disciples! No wonder&mdash;they're a bunch of clueless folks, destined to lose their money!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar and Bethan's expressions were a mix of disbelief and dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you two sticking to your bets?" the casino employee asked with a smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They clenched their jaws and nodded in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great! Here's your ticket!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The employee grinned as he accepted their wagers, handing them a receipt while casting a curious glance at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne appeared oblivious to the laughter surrounding him. He turned to the casino staff and asked, "By the way, what's the maximum amount I can wager here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The staff member was momentarily taken aback before puffing up with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This casino is backed by none other than Azure Haven Academy! We can handle any size of bet! Whether it's ten thousand Sacred Crystals or a million, we've got you covered. There's no limit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a soft chuckle. "Oh? </span><span>So</span><span> you've got the backing of Azure Haven Academy? That sure makes me feel a lot better!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he reached into his Dimensional Bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In that case, I'd like to place a bet. Please put all the Sacred Crystals in this bag on Osborne from Mystic Sirius Sect to win the city duel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden silence fell over the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Bethan and Jamar, standing right next to him, gaped at Osborne in utter disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is he really betting on himself to win the championship again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After seeing the might of Marreese and Tyson and hearing about Leroy's strength, how could he still be so confident? Or is he just plain nuts?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The casino employee took the Dimensional Bag with a trembling hand. His eyes nearly popped out of his head when he took a peek inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten thousand Sacred Crystals? You're betting all this on Osborne from Mystic Sirius Sect to win?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice shot up an octave, bordering on a shrill squeal of astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nearby gamblers were equally </span><span>gobsmacked</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?! Someone just plunked down ten thousand Sacred Crystals on Osborne from Mystic Sirius Sect?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's this nutjob?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Has he taken leave of his senses? With ten thousand Sacred Crystals, he could snag a top-notch quasi-Sacred Artifact! Why throw it away like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who on earth would do such a thing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on! Isn't he the top disciple of Mystic Sirius Sect? That's Osborne! He's betting ten thousand Sacred Crystals on himself to win?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, has he flipped his lid?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What gives him the idea that he can win?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was abuzz, their eyes brimming with disbelief as they sized up Osborne, firmly believing he'd completely lost his marbles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne ignored them completely and turned to the casino employee with a knowing smirk on his face. "What's the problem? Am I not allowed to place this bet? Didn't you just claim you could handle any wager?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The staff </span><span>member</span><span> </span><span>finally snapped out of his daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic started to creep in as he realized the odds of Osborne winning were a staggering one hundred and three to one. If Osborne managed to pull it off, the casino would be on the hook for a whopping 1.3 million Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a huge loss, even for an establishment backed by Azure Haven Academy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait a sec, I need to check with my superiors," he stammered, then rushed off to make a call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few moments later, a smile spread across his face as he turned back to Osborne. "The management has given the green light for your bet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Letting out a sigh of relief, he quickly stashed the Dimensional Bag away and handed Osborne a betting receipt, as if afraid Osborne might change his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took the ticket and carefully tucked it into his stuff. "Alright then! Our bets are in. Time to head back!"</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
