  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What on earth are you babbling about? Did you take a blow to the head? Are you insane?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne sneered, turning his back on the scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam turned somber and furiously spat out, "Osborne, your arrogance will catch up with you sooner rather than later. Just wait for the vengeance from Marcelin, Ransford, and Norlend!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The branch bloodline from Dampston is far too feeble; your fate is doomed!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without a backward glance, Osborne dissolved into the shadows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam clenched his fists angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All eyes were upon him, intensifying his ire, as if he had become the butt of a cruel joke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you looking at?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The competition is not yet concluded. If we cannot vie for the Heir's Emblem, we must still contend for the branch bloodline rankings!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Attack!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that declaration, Sam launched a sudden assault on the members from Norlend and Stayton, aiming to vanquish them all and secure a higher standing for Marcelin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The higher the branch bloodline's ranking, the more resources the main bloodline would bestow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But more importantly, Sam sought to vent his frustrations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was furious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those who had once united against Osborne now found themselves embroiled in a chaotic melee, each striving to eliminate their adversaries for a superior ranking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ten minutes later, the skirmish drew to a close.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the end, it was the branch bloodline from Marcelin, led by Sam, that stood triumphant, dispatching the members of the other branches one by one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, Sam's anger remained unquenched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The image of Osborne haunted his thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Through gritted teeth, Sam hissed, "Osborne! How dare you thwart my plans? Let's go and see!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, at the Augustine Estate, an eerie silence enveloped the spectators when their eyes were glued to the broadcast in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No one had anticipated the Branch Bloodline Competition to conclude in such a manner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The ultimate victor was none other than Osborne!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Sam and Rodney had joined forces, it seemed certain that Osborne, despite his cunning, was doomed. The Heir's Emblem would surely slip from his grasp, and he would be eliminated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But in the end, Osborne emerged victorious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's primary power was revealed to be Thunder Power, and he had already mastered its intermediate application&mdash;Thunder Explosion!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The might of the Thunder Explosion sent shockwaves through the crowd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even the formidable Rodney, shielded by a level-four ancient magic weapon, suffered grievous injuries, left with but a thread of life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, everyone was shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Osborne seized the Forbidden Space Disk and unsealed the space, it became clear to all that Osborne had won!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that juncture, save for Isaac, Nathan, and Queenie from Dampston, the others looked discontent. No cheers were heard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This outcome was utterly unexpected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In their eyes, the branch bloodline from Dampston seemed undoubtedly the weakest among the Augustine family's nine branch bloodlines.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was far from being their peer, not even close to the likes of Sam, David, and Rodney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, the final victor was Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No one could come to terms with it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, the one who struggled the most to accept this reality was Owen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Owen witnessed Osborne employing Thunder Explosion, fury contorted his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That jerk!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without hesitation, Owen turned on his heel and departed, acknowledging that after Osborne's display of Thunder Explosion, he felt threatened. Owen needed to return and prepare for what was to come.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "You've become the heir-to-be, have you?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Very well! Now that you're the quasi-heir, you're my true rival, Osborne! You wish to compete with me? I'll make you despair!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't think you're anything special just because you've bested a few useless members from other branch bloodlines! Wait until you truly face me, and you'll understand the magnitude of the chasm between us!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen furiously vanished from Challenge Peak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was only after his departure that the audience at Challenge Peak began to buzz with chatter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon after, nearly every eye turned toward Isaac and his companions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their faces around Isaac and his companions were etched with anger and malice. If not for the Augustine family rules prohibiting fighting, they might have already made their move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isaac looked solemn as he swiftly gestured with his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's go! The Branch Bloodline Competition is over; we must return at once!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Although Osborne has won this time, he has also made too many enemies. We may face hardships ahead!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's head back and await Osborne's return!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Isaac led his people away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By this time, Osborne had already reached the highest peak of the Lostridge Mountains, the summit known as Lostridge Peak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Atop Lostridge Peak, a towering figure sat cross-legged on a boulder. His eyes were closed in meditation. Powerful energy fluctuations surrounded him, far surpassing those of Sam and Rodney, instilling a sense of dread in those who felt them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was Lance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not far from him, nineteen masters from Yalynch stood guard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they caught sight of Osborne approaching, they were all taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lance opened his eyes. Surprise was evident in his gaze as he addressed Osborne, "How did you end up here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why shouldn't it be me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne replied with a faint smile, "I won, so here I am."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You won?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lance was even more surprised. "How is that possible? Where are Sam and David? Did they join forces only to be defeated by you? Are you kidding?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lance frowned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His disbelief was deepening into disdain as he looked at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He could not fathom how Osborne could have emerged victorious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne shrugged, too indifferent to entertain Lance's skepticism.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lance turned stern, a flicker of irritation crossing his features.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He yelled, "Osborne, answer me!"</p><div class="pagination">
