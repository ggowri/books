  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's pretty face instantly turned red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling shy, she lowered her head and followed Osborne, finally entering the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's take a bath first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and joked as he looked at Clarissa's blushing cheeks, "Clarissa, do you want to take a bath together?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's ears turned red instantly upon hearing his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought she would shyly refuse, but she bit her lip and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Y-you go ahead and prepare the hot water," Clarissa stammered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was momentarily stunned by her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he rushed into the bathroom and filled the big bathtub with hot water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he came out, he found that Clarissa had already changed into a robe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her perfect figure was partially exposed, catching Osborne's attention immediately. He couldn't help but swallow hard and walked over to embrace her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's skin had a faint pink hue, making her look extremely shy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised her head and looked into Osborne's eyes seriously. "Osborne, you said that we shouldn't do it until we reach Class AAA. So, don't do anything inappropriate, okay?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll just take a bath together. If you dare to do anything improper, I'll... I'll..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa struggled to find the right words while blushing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Completely unable to resist the temptation, Osborne immediately picked Clarissa up and rushed into the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rest assured. I won't do anything inappropriate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Osborne immediately stripped off Clarissa's robe, exposing her flawless body in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes glazed over, and he couldn't help but swallow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that he might have overestimated his own self-control. Seeing Clarissa's perfect body right in front of him, Osborne felt a raging fire erupting in his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he resist her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he kissed her passionately, leaving a trail of kisses from her neck to her ears, down to her chest, and all the way to her lower abdomen, leaving marks everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's body trembled </span><span>uncontrollably,</span><span> her eyes filled with a dazed look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they knew it, they were both in the bathtub.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa felt that Osborne was struggling to control himself at this moment. Her face showed signs of hesitation and struggle, but she eventually looked determined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hugged Osborne's neck and whispered in his ear, "Osborne, I... I can help you like last time with my mouth, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's desire intensified upon hearing her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Clarissa, deeply moved, but he still said, "Clarissa, that's too much to ask. I can handle it. This is good enough for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa blushed even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's not! You have done so much for me, so I'm willing to do anything for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Clarissa suddenly lowered her head and submerged herself in the water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next second, Osborne took a sharp breath and leaned back against the edge of the bathtub.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He watched as Clarissa helped him with her mouth underwater and felt satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time went by quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After enjoying it in the bathtub for a long time, Osborne finally felt released. Eventually, when everything came to an end, Clarissa was exhausted. Osborne carried her back to the bed and held her perfect body tightly before falling into a deep sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They slept until the following day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne woke up, he found Clarissa curled up in his embrace, their hot bodies closely pressed together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, Osborne felt the fire within him rekindle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body quickly began to change, and his well-endowed thing pressed against Clarissa's lower abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing Osborne's change, Clarissa woke up immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She blushed even more this time. Without a hint of hesitation, she kissed Osborne on the lips and then moved to his lower body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hiss!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After experiencing extreme pleasure, Osborne finally let Clarissa go and carefully tugged her in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, you can sleep in a bit. I have some things to attend," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa curled up her body and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne walked out of the room and found the people from Training Base No. 6.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had occupied the largest training hall in the headquarters and were engaged in combat training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne, No. 1 quickly ran over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded with a smile. "You don't have to train so hard now. We will soon be going into battle, so everyone needs to rest well to have the strength to fight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No. 1 grinned and replied, "Mr. Augustine, we're used to it. If we don't train for a day, we actually feel worse and can't even sleep well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne helplessly shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without saying another word, he suddenly extended his hand and initiated the pure blood energy from the Blood Cross. Drop by drop, blood-like pure energy condensed in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These blood energies could enhance the strength of the people from Training Base No. 6, making them even stronger when they transformed into vampires.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had absorbed a large amount of blood during this period. So, the energy within the Blood Cross was abundant. He could now produce a large quantity of blood energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No. 1 immediately became excited when he saw so much blood energy. His body trembled with anticipation.</span></p><div class="pagination">
