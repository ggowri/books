It was right after I took over the slave trading business, so I was keenly aware of every buyer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That batch of slaves from the Human Community on Celestara Planet? The ultimate buyers were a group known as the Frenetic Storm Warband, a Stellar Exploration Organization! Those slaves weren't of high quality. The Frenetic Storm Warband even came back to us, raising a ruckus and demanding an explanation. They seemed to want to return the slaves... Eventually, the big shot stepped in, and he managed to get some refund. That's how the whole thing died down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My old man got reamed out by that big shot because of this! And he gave me an earful too. So, it's burned into my memory."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Vince finished speaking, Osborne frowned deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Frenetic Storm Warband? A Stellar Exploration Organization? What the hell do they need so many slaves for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vince continued, "Well, they use them as cannon fodder and cheap labor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This part of space is called the Racial Convergence Stellar Region, and there are plenty of Stellar Exploration Organizations like the Frenetic Storm Warband. They just wander around, looking for unclaimed resource planets to plunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Some of these resource planets are super dangerous. Sure, there might not be any intelligent life on them, but they're swarming with ferocious monsters and bugs. One slip-up, and you're a goner!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Most people wouldn't dream of taking such risks. But for Stellar Exploration Organizations like </span><span>the </span><span>Frenetic Storm Warband, it's all in a day's work. They buy a ton of slaves to scout those resource planets first. If the slaves die, they don't bat an eye!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they find a planet that's safe, they move in and work those slaves to the bone, extracting resources until there's nothing left!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These organizations rake in wealth, but they also need a steady supply of expendable labor... That's why the slave trade in the Racial Convergence Stellar Region has never really stopped."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Vince wrapped up, Osborne's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If what Vince says is true, then my parents </span><span style="font-style: italic;">were</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> sold to the Frenetic Storm Warband over twenty years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">They've been used as expendable laborers on those dangerous resource planets, working to extract resources for the organization?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">My parents, with their low cultivation levels... Are they even still alive?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was stormy, his fists clenched. All he could do now was pray that his parents had been lucky enough to survive all this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath and asked, "How can I track down the Frenetic Storm Warband?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vince's face twisted with uncertainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned and replied, "Finding organizations like </span><span>the </span><span>Frenetic Storm Warband isn't easy. They tend to drift through the cosmos, searching for resource planets... and the </span><span>more remote the area, the more untouched resource planets there are. It's quite difficult to locate them, unless..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unless what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vince said, "Unless they come back here to buy slaves again! Then they'd set up a temporary Spatial Translocator with us, making it easier to send the slaves directly to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To find them, we'd have to use that temporary Spatial Translocator! But... it's been twenty years since </span><span>the </span><span>Frenetic Storm Warband last bought slaves from us. I can't reach them; it's always been that they contact the big shot behind us, and the big shot contacts us, letting us know when to prepare enough slaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe only that big shot knows how to get in touch with the Frenetic Storm Warband!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vince looked at Osborne with pleading eyes. "I swear, everything I said is true! Please, just let me go! We're being forced by that big shot..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shot him a cold glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Forced?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe at first, the Phantom Tide Demon Sect was under pressure, but once they tasted the profits, they didn't look back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slave trade has brought them immense wealth and protection from that big shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Letting Vince go? Not a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling he had extracted enough information, Osborne considered that continuing to question Vince would yield little more. It was better to end him and delve into his memories directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, he had hesitated to kill Vince, worried it might alert Bancroft and the entire Phantom Tide Demon Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with the confirmation that his parents had indeed been sold by them, he didn't need to be cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Selling my parents to the Frenetic Storm Warband?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Vince, you're dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Bancroft, you're dead too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Phantom Tide Demon Sect deserves to be wiped out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Such a nefarious organization shouldn't even exist!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne wasn't in a rush to kill Vince just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said coldly, "Now, get your father over here. Tell him we have a situation that needs his immediate attention! And don't say anything else... I'll be watching you. If you say one wrong word, I'll end you right here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had made up his mind to confront Bancroft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the leader of the Phantom Tide Demon Sect, Bancroft, knew who that big shot was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And only by finding that big shot could Osborne figure out how to contact the Frenetic Storm Warband and locate his parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vince froze at Osborne's command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? You don't want to? Should I just kill you first and then contact your father to collect your body?" Osborne pressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vince stammered, "No! No! No! I'll contact him right away! I promise I won't say anything out of line!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Vince hurriedly pulled out a communications terminal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, the connection was established.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, there's been an unexpected issue here, and I can't ship the goods right now! Don't worry, everything's fine with the batch; they're all in good shape, just a minor problem that needs your personal attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right! I'll explain everything when you get here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After disconnecting, Vince looked at Osborne again, his eyes filled with desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne ignored him, settling down cross-legged to prepare for what was to come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft, the leader of the Phantom Tide Demon Sect, was an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King. Over a thousand years ago, Bancroft had already reached Ascension Ten, and now he was just a step away from becoming an Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft's power far surpassed that of Lord Malevolence, who had only recently broken through Ascension Ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Osborne wasn't afraid&mdash;he had already reached Ascension Seven and was much stronger than when he faced Lord Malevolence&mdash;he still approached the situation with caution when it came to Bancroft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He focused, waiting for Bancroft's arrival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Osborne suddenly opened his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massive door to the cavernous space swung open, and a colossal warship zipped inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vince, what kind of unexpected trouble are we talking about? Why couldn't you just explain? You really are useless if you can't handle something so small!" a thunderous voice boomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, a figure leaped from the ship. As he took in the surroundings, he froze in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Vince caught sight of his father, his face was instantly suffused with a flood of emotions. His eyes welled up and turned red, and he let out a desperate wail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad! Help me, please! You've got to save me!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
