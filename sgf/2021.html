  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, Zoe, and the other five faced the hundred Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings from the Paramount Supreme Clan without a hint of panic, remaining utterly calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though these opponents appeared to be at Ascension Two, they were only at Ascension One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was because Osborne possessed the Absolute Forbidden Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Osborne activated the Absolute Forbidden Zone, their cultivation levels would be suppressed to Ascension One, turning the upcoming battle into a one-sided slaughter like before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne's next words left them all stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For this round, give it your all! I won't be using the Absolute Forbidden Zone! After all, it drains a lot of energy. A hundred Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings, all geniuses from the Paramount Supreme Clan, should be enough to pressure you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Show me what you've got."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, Anastasia and the others looked at him in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia rolled her eyes and said, "Osborne, not only are you not using the Absolute Forbidden Zone, but it sounds like you're not even planning to fight. You're leaving the seven of us to take on a hundred of them? What if we can't handle it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said with a smile, "I believe in you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he waved his hand. "Let's fight! Let the ten billion members of the Human Alliance and the fifty billion Dark Deity Legion in the square witness your strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he spoke, Anastasia and the others immediately grew serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged glances. Their expressions calmed once more, but their fighting spirit ignited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hundred Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was indeed a lot of pressure for them, as they were only at Ascension One. Even seven Ascension Three Supernal Deity Kings wouldn't dare claim an easy victory against a hundred Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings from the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they were willing to give it a try!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's fight! Osborne's got our backs anyway. Even if we lose, it's not the end of the world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce said, his fighting spirit blazing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Anastasia and the other six took the initiative to attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, their opponents were Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings, at least ten times stronger than their previous foes. They couldn't afford to let the enemy strike first; falling behind would make it nearly impossible to turn the tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tempest Jinx!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Incendio!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, they fought with even greater focus. Their attacks were more deliberate, no longer solely focused on unleashing their full power to quickly slaughter the enemy. Instead, they prioritized coordination and finding weaknesses in their opponents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hundred Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings from the Paramount Supreme Clan quickly reacted, launching a fierce counterattack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings far surpassed that of Ascension One. With a hundred of them attacking simultaneously, the arena seemed to transform into a boiling pool of magma, with various forces roaring wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, Zoe, and the others soon found themselves at a disadvantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their numbers were simply too few.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though individually stronger than the Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings, they faced over a dozen times as many enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with strength comparable to Ascension Three Supernal Deity Kings, they were quickly overwhelmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just moments, their situation looked dire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This development made the Human Community members extremely anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why isn't Osborne making a move?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's the leader of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings! Shouldn't he be the strongest? Why is he staying back, not even lifting a finger?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If this keeps up, the others won't be able to hold on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This battle shouldn't have happened!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can they possibly win?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, just admit defeat! Don't die in the arena! Our Human Alliance's morale has just started to recover. If they die here, all our previous efforts and victories will be for nothing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Light, please stop this match! Even if we lose this round, we've already won overall today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They can't die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd's anxious pleas reached the Goddess of Light, but she shook her head slightly, her eyes fixed intently on the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why the rush? They're only at a disadvantage, not defeated yet! And... I don't think they'll lose. Just watch closely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, the God of Light's expression turned shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Osborne stepping in, Anastasia, Zoe, and the other five were actually holding their own against the hundred Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings from the Paramount Supreme Clan. Though they seemed to be at a disadvantage, there was no sign of them losing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weren't even flustered...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do these kids have so much combat experience? Their coordination is flawless! It's like they've been through countless battles, facing overwhelming odds repeatedly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These kids are something else!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought Osborne would use his special ability to suppress their opponents' cultivation levels... but he didn't, and it looks like they might still win?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These guys are truly remarkable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light's eyes gleamed brighter, for only he could see that the situation in the arena wasn't as dire as it seemed for Anastasia, Zoe, and the others. In fact, it was gradually improving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another person who could see the situation clearly...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Icy One!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's expression had turned grim, his fists clenched as he stared at Anastasia, Zoe, and the others in the arena, his killing intent boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They must die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, once they fully mature, they'll be no weaker than the former Seven Kings of the Human Community! Their potential might even surpass that of the Human Community's Seven Great Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Especially Osborne..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's gaze fixed on Osborne. Though Osborne hadn't made a move, it was him Icy One truly wanted to kill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was the leader of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne could command the respect of Anastasia, Zoe, and the others, his strength and talent must surpass theirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could he be another Dark Lord?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this thought, Icy One's expression grew even more solemn, his killing intent intensifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He must be killed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with just these hundred Ascension Two in the arena, it's impossible! It seems I'll have to resort to some special methods!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned his attention back to the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, even others could see that something was off. Though the hundred Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings from the Paramount Supreme Clan seemed to have the upper hand, they hadn't managed to inflict any real damage on Anastasia and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, they were the ones taking damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was Anastasia's lightning, Zoe's soul attacks, Kendra's flames, or Mila's Light Power, all could injure the enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, these injuries seemed insignificant, but as time passed, the accumulated damage began to take its toll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, some of the Paramount Supreme Clan's Ascension Two Supernal Deity Kings started falling...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And in that moment, Anastasia and the others intensified their assault, accelerating the rate at which their enemies fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This turn of events made Icy One's expression darken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! You're really tough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I won't let you slaughter the Paramount Supreme Clan's warriors so easily!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Admit defeat!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
