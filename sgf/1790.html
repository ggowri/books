  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fierce battle had waged on for five tense minutes, and the situation in the arena remained eerily balanced, with no clear victor in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tristram, at mid-stage Deity King, held a higher ground than Zoe and was armed with the Supreme Malevolence Sword and Shield, making it exceedingly difficult for Mila to defeat him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The standoff had settled into a deadlock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Diana faced seven talented fighters from the Paramount Supreme Clan, each wielding their own Supreme Malevolence Sword and Shield. Gradually, she began to falter under their assault, yet her defenses were remarkably strong. With her earth elemental essence reaching late Level Eight, her divine power was formidable enough to instill despair in her opponents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Having the Supreme Malevolence Shield further bolstered her defenses, making it nearly impossible for the seven attackers to subdue her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the clash evolved into a war of attrition, neither side could predict the outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This looks like it might end in a draw," murmured the representatives of various races, their faces sullen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While they weren't keen on the idea of a stalemate, at least it wouldn't be a loss, thereby preserving some semblance of honor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, no one's gaining any ground. It appears it'll end in a stalemate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as they resigned themselves to the thought that this fierce contest would conclude without resolution, the tide suddenly shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm done playing games with you!" Mila exclaimed, breaking away from her struggle with Tristram and darting to Diana's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, it's clear that going solo isn't going to cut it. Let's join forces!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Absolutely!" Diana responded with a quick nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Join forces?" Tristram scoffed as he swiftly positioned himself alongside the seven Paramount Supreme Clan fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He smirked derisively. "You can't beat me on your own, so now you think teaming up will change anything?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mila smiled, confidence radiating, "If we were at the same level, I'd defeat you without breaking a sweat! Let's see if our teamwork can accomplish this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Mila charged into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tristram's expression darkened. He understood that his ability to match Mila stemmed from his superior rank; if they were on equal footing, he wouldn't stand a chance against her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in the grand scheme, it didn't matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as he emerged victorious, no one would question it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He immediately joined the fray with his allies, launching a frenzied assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, an alarming realization quickly dawned on him. As soon as Mila and Diana teamed up, they became a formidable force that he hadn't anticipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Tristram could hold his own against Mila, and the seven warriors could suppress Diana, their combined efforts proved to be more than Tristram and his allies could handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was as if Mila and Diana moved in perfect synchrony, each anticipating the other's moves. Their training together had clearly forged a bond that was far beyond what he and his seven companions could muster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, Tristram and the Paramount Supreme Clan fighters found themselves at a distinct disadvantage. The duo of Mila and Diana pressed the attack, overpowering them with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How is this possible?" Tristram grappled with disbelief, grappling for excuses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Surely, his allies weren't slacking off!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It became evident that wasn't the case. The synergy between Mila and Diana exceeded anything he had expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Together, they created a combined force that eclipsed that of his team&mdash;their one plus one turned into something greater than two, while Tristram's group painfully demonstrated that one plus one equaled less than two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the tide swiftly turning, Mila and Diana soon hit their rhythm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They unleashed a series of strikes, taking down Tristram's companions one by one and sending them sprawling from the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then two!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In no time, all seven Paramount Supreme Clan fighters were eliminated, leaving only Tristram standing among the remnants of his fallen allies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As reality hit him, Tristram's expression turned gloomy with a mix of fury and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tristram glowered at the two women, his teeth clenched. "You fight without honor! If it were one-on-one, I'd crush you both without breaking a sweat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mila let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How ridiculous! You have eight people, and we only have two! Now that you're about to lose, you're crying about dishonor? Is this how all members of the Paramount Supreme Clan behave&mdash;so shameless?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just accept your defeat and lie down already!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mila and Diana launched themselves forward, ready to take advantage of the moment and subdue Tristram once and for all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop!" A sharp voice cut through the tension, halting their advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A powerful force suddenly erupted on the stage, intercepting Mila and Diana's attacks and pulling Tristram back to safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An elderly figure emerged from the Supreme Malevolence Airship, his gaze fixed coldly on Osborne and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The elder declared, his voice a chilling calm, "This battle is ours to concede. You Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings truly live up to your reputation, each more dazzling and powerful than the last!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, let's move on to the final showdown!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you Seven Young Deity Kings can prevail again, then the Paramount Supreme Clan will accept our loss. But... you won't win this next battle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Step forward, Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, and witness our true strength! We'll show you the real prodigies of the Paramount Supreme Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, the elder's cold words echoed, and figures began to emerge from the various Supreme Malevolence Airships, powerful presences slipping into view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In total, seven warriors appeared, each at least mid-stage Deity King, radiating an aura that signaled their formidable prowess.</span></p><div class="pagination">
