  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when Osborne thought he was going to die, a beautiful figure suddenly stepped in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was a woman so perfect it felt unreal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind her, a pair of enormous wings unfurled. One was pure white, radiating holiness. The other was pure gold, exuding an eerie malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine and Demonic Wings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Clarissa!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa stood in front of Osborne, using her Divine and Demonic Wings to shield him from all the residual forces. Her face was filled with fury and coldness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you hurt Osborne this badly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastards, you all deserve to die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa said angrily. She summoned the Fate Staff into her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa? You broke through?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Clarissa, who had first blocked the Titan's attack with the Trident of Poseidon, then shielded him from the residual attacks with her Divine and Demonic Wings. His emotions surged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Clarissa turned her head. Seeing Osborne's miserable state, her eyes filled with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I'm sorry I came out too late!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all my fault. If I hadn't broken through so slowly, you wouldn't have been surrounded, and you wouldn't be hurt this badly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa said, and large tears streamed down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly raised the Fate Staff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine Healing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, a beam of light descended from the sky, falling on Osborne's body. He immediately felt a surge of vitality rush into him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His broken body began to recover at a visibly rapid pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it wasn't as fast as the Light of Redemption, it was still incredibly powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within just a few breaths, Osborne's injuries were almost fully healed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What an amazing Divine Healing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's Divine Healing wasn't as powerful as the Light of Redemption. It could only heal injuries, not restore depleted energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew that Clarissa's Divine Healing could be used repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that sense, Divine Healing was even more formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, while the Light of Redemption was powerful, it could only be used once every half hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne slowly stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa suddenly rushed into Osborne's arms, holding him tightly as her body trembled violently. Tears streamed down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm covered in blood. I'm getting your clothes dirty," Osborne said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa shook her head vigorously. She didn't care about the clothes. She only cared about Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, they are still here. Let's deal with them first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne released Clarissa and stepped in front of her. His face was cold and fierce as he stared at the Medusa, Werewolf, and Titan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I'm not dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you will be!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished speaking, the faces of the three, already pale, turned even paler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, the three of them fled in different directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's scatter! This space is frozen. He can only kill one of us! Let's rely on our luck!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them rushed in three different directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Clarissa looked anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I'll chase them! When I broke through, something unexpected happened, and a sudden surge of power pushed me beyond Class A to Class AA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm really strong now. I can kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Clarissa was about to give chase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stopped her, looking surprised. "You broke through to Class AA?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was then that Osborne realized that Clarissa's energy aura was indeed Class AA. And it was far more powerful than his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder you were able to block Titan's ultimate move! You've reached Class AA. With the Trident of Poseidon and the Fate Staff, even I might be unable to match you now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Class B+ straight to Class AA?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne quickly accepted it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa had always been somewhat extraordinary. Not long ago, Osborne had personally witnessed her advance from a beginner to Class B+.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, her leap from Class B+ to Class AA didn't seem all that surprising.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa blushed when she heard Osborne's praise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not at all. I think you're the strongest! But this isn't the time to discuss it. If we don't chase them now, they'll get away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne responded with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. They've already used their ultimate moves and are at their limit. They </span><span>won't escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Osborne looked in the direction where the three were fleeing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think that freezing this space will keep me from catching you? How laughable! Do you really believe that I can't break through a frozen space?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne fixed his gaze on Medusa, now a few miles away. He suddenly reached out his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Collapse!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Buzz!</span></p><div class="pagination">
