  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood Ancestor&mdash;the progenitor of the Blood Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Osborne merged with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, he became the natural Blood Ancestor. Every member of the Blood Clan, whether transformed by him or not, would fall under his control, bound by his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, all thirty-five hundred </span><span>god</span><span>-tier warriors of the Pantheon League had been transformed into Blood Clan members. They could no longer betray him; they would carry out Osborne's orders without question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he commanded them to die, they would do so without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this was only the beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's ambitions reached far beyond these three thousand-plus elite warriors. He </span><span>had his sights set on the hundreds of thousands of ordinary metahumans within this Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He intended to transform every single one of them into Blood Clan members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though these individuals were not particularly strong, their sheer numbers&mdash;over 100 thousand&mdash;could significantly boost Osborne's power when he needed it most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And they wouldn't just be static; they could continue to grow stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they all ascended to godhood, they would become an incredibly formidable force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this thought in mind, Osborne unleashed a torrent of blood mist from his body, manifesting before everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This mist was enough to transform every person in the Dimensional Microcosm into Blood Clan members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He commanded, "Now, return to your people. Have them merge with my blood. Every single one of them must become Blood Clan! Remember, not a single soul is to be left out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood, Blood Ancestor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, they carefully safeguarded Osborne's blood essence and hurried away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under their influence, everyone in the Dimensional Microcosm began to merge with Osborne's blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, they were transformed into Blood Clan members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The numbers swelled rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a few hours, all 186 thousand individuals within the Pantheon League's Dimensional Microcosm had been converted into Blood Clan members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity began to move on their own, intertwining with their bodies, allowing Osborne to draw power from them at will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, these individuals gained something in return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would be sheltered by the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, granting them immortality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a wave of satisfaction wash over him as he realized that every last person had been transformed into the Blood Clan. It was time to set his next plan in motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He intended to merge the Pantheon League's Dimensional Microcosm with that of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Dimensional Microcosm was vast, spanning an area of sixty miles&mdash;dozens of times larger than the Augustine family's mere three-mile expanse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, it was a paradise, meticulously crafted and thriving with life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For others, merging Dimensional Microcosms was an impossible feat. But Osborne was a spatial metahuman. His space elemental essence had reached Level Six, enabling him to construct Dimensional Microcosms with his own hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Merging two of them would be straightforward for him&mdash;far simpler than creating a new one from scratch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get this fusion started!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stepped out of the Dimensional Microcosm, holding its vessel in his hand. </span><span>He absorbed it into his body, placing it atop the petals of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the power of space erupted around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vessels of the </span><span>two Dimensional</span><span> Microcosms began to merge under the influence of his spatial energy, slowly intertwining into one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the midst of the Augustine family's Dimensional Microcosm, a faint tremor rippled through the ground, swiftly followed by the emergence of a vast expanse of new territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The microcosm had expanded exponentially in an instant, its acreage multiplying dozens of times over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The family members, taken aback, soared into the air, their gazes sweeping across the newly-formed land. There, they beheld a sprawling city and a multitude of Pantheon League members&mdash;hundreds of thousands strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their expressions shifted abruptly to one of alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Prepare for battle!" Sebastian bellowed, his voice trembling with uncertainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no inkling of what had transpired, only that it seemed an invasion of their sacred microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that very moment, Osborne materialized beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, there's no need to panic! These are not enemies. They are all from the Pantheon League but have pledged their allegiance to me. From now on, they are our own. Treat them as servants, bodyguards&mdash;whatever you wish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The change you see is the merger of the Pantheon League's microcosm with ours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's eyes widened in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Pantheon League had been vanquished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its remaining members had submitted to Osborne, who had transformed them into the unswervingly loyal Blood Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, Lord League, and Dark Deity Legion had all met the same fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family had ascended to the pinnacle of power on Blue Planet; they were now its undisputed rulers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cascade of revelations left Sebastian reeling, his mind struggling to process the magnitude of these developments. It took a considerable moment for him to regain his composure.</span></p><div class="pagination">
