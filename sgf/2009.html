  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the same grand hall, the leaders of the major factions within the Human Community had already gathered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light had not yet arrived, and everyone was quietly discussing among themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Strange... Yesterday, God of Light didn't summon us to discuss today's matches. Who's even competing today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did any of you get notified?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! None of the people in our family who are eligible to compete got any notice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? No one in our family got one either!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our faction didn't get anything either!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"None of us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone began to feel puzzled. God of Light hadn't informed anyone about today's competitors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that God of Light has already given up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does she think continuing the matches is pointless? That we won't win, and it'll just demoralize the Human Alliance? Is that why she's abandoning it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doesn't that mean full-scale war is about to begin?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'd better be ready. I feel like the war is about to start! I just don't know if we can hold out this time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where is the God of Night? Why hasn't he stepped up to take control?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Relying on God of Light alone isn't going to cut it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd's discussions grew increasingly pessimistic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, God of Light finally arrived, and the hall instantly fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone turned their eyes toward her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Tanner cupped his hands and asked, "God of Light, are you planning to abandon the matches?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light raised an eyebrow. "Why would you ask that? When did I ever say we were giving up? Our goal remains the same&mdash;to use the matches to buy as much time as possible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner gritted his teeth. "If you haven't abandoned the matches, then why haven't you informed us about today's competitors? Are you planning to pick them on the spot?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light shook her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! The reason no one was informed is that the competitors have already been selected. If you didn't receive a notification, it means you're not competing today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was shocked. The competitors had already been chosen? And since their families or factions hadn't been notified, that meant they weren't needed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then who was competing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that all the competitors were Radiant Guardians from the Sanctum of Light?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at God of Light in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian spoke up, "God of Light, could we see the list of competitors? The matches are far too important, and we should select warriors from the entire Human Community. Relying solely on the Sanctum's Radiant Guardians... might not be enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unless, of course, you've already given up on the idea of winning!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light looked at Julian and said calmly, "There's no list today! But the competitors have already been chosen. Some are Radiant Guardians, some are from the Hudson family, and the rest are from the Demon Slayer organization."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she finished speaking, everyone froze once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of the competitors being Radiant Guardians and members of the Hudson family was understandable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Demon Slayer organization...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did the Human Community even have such a faction?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone exchanged looks, seeing the same confusion and doubt reflected in each other's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of them had ever heard of the Demon Slayer organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian frowned and said, "God of Light, are you saying that today's matches will be fought entirely by the Radiant Guardians, the Hudson family, and this Demon Slayer organization? Isn't that completely unreasonable? This is practically giving up any chance of winning!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the past two days, even after selecting the strongest warriors from the entire Human Community, we still suffered devastating losses! If we don't win even a single match today, the morale of the Human Alliance will completely collapse!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what is this Demon Slayer organization? None of us have ever heard of it! Everyone here represents the dukedom-level or first-rate powers of the Human Community. Does that mean Demon Slayer isn't even a first-rate faction?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing, Julian's expression was filled with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't agree with this selection of competitors!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light looked at Julian calmly and said, "This selection of competitors was decided by me. As for the Demon Slayer organization, it's a newly established dukedom-level faction within the Human Community. Once the matches begin, you'll see for yourselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for your disagreement with my decision... If you can come up with a plan that guarantees more than four victories in today's matches, I'll hand over the authority to you and let you decide who competes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she finished, Julian froze in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lips twitched, and he was at a loss for words. Eventually, he muttered stubbornly, "Winning four matches? That's way too difficult! Based on the last two days, it's practically impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Light, your expectations are way too unreasonable! Do you really think the lineup you've chosen can secure four victories for us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he spoke, the crowd burst into intense discussions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could sense that the repeated failures over the past two days had caused people like Julian to lose their respect and trust in her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they even dared to openly oppose her decisions!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she didn't use her authority to suppress them. Instead, she replied calmly, "Whether we can win four matches or not, you'll find out soon enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian opened his mouth to speak again, but when he saw God of Light's increasingly serious expression, he stopped himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He merely said coldly, "Then I'll be watching closely!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light ignored him and scanned the crowd. She saw Jethro but didn't see Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She immediately turned to Jethro and asked, "Jethro, hasn't Osborne arrived yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro quickly responded, "God of Light, they should be here soon! After leaving yesterday, they went into seclusion to train."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light nodded, a hint of praise in her gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maximizing every moment to train&mdash;that's how they've achieved their current strength. It's not just talent but also their hard work!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words immediately made the crowd even more curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who was this Osborne they were talking about?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light actually praised him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was deeply puzzled and turned to look at Jethro.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro didn't offer any explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, as if sensing something, he turned his gaze toward the entrance of the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light also turned to look in that direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the entrance, a tall and youthful figure appeared, followed by an equally young and stunning woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Osborne, accompanied by Anastasia and Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you're finally here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light smiled as she greeted Osborne, gesturing for him and his companions to come forward and join her at the front.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and walked forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd instinctively parted, their gazes filled with shock and confusion as they stared at the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, this was Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this group was so young?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What gave them the right to be here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, everyone present in this hall was either a dukedom-level powerhouse or the leader of a first-rate power&mdash;veteran warriors, each and every one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So why were Osborne and his companions here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not to mention, God of Light's attitude toward them seemed unusually warm...</span></p><div class="pagination">
