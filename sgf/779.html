  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ron's words instantly made everyone rush to check the Diviner League's website.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone was shocked when they saw that the person codenamed "Night" had suddenly taken the number one spot on the Godson Rankings, pushing "Lord" down to second.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Diviner League must have made a mistake, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This 'Night' has never appeared on the rankings before. How could she suddenly take first place? Does the Diviner League think she's stronger than all of us? Stronger than Lord?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lord fought the S-class Supreme Overlord head-on and even managed to suppress him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd buzzed with excitement, and no one cared about the ongoing battle in the ring. Everyone was talking about who this 'Night' person was and how she managed to jump to first place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately, no one could figure out why.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'Night's profile revealed nothing. No age, no photo, no affiliation. It's just the fact that she was a woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some people even called their elders to ask for information.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My grandfather told me not to get involved. He also warned me that if I ever meet 'Night,' I should show the utmost respect and never anger her," one person said, stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone stared at him in disbelief, as his grandfather was the leader of a powerful organization and ranked high on the Quasi-Divine Rankings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hiss!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This 'Night' is probably a hidden master. There are many like her who haven't fought publicly, so their strength can't be measured, which is why she hasn't been on the rankings before."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now that she's come out of hiding and made her move, she probably defeated the S-class Supreme Overlord. That's why the Diviner League thinks she's stronger than Lord and ranked her first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That must be it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I wonder where she is now. I'd love to meet her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd became even more curious about 'Night.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only Osborne was left speechless. He couldn't understand how Isa suddenly took the number one spot on the Godson Rankings. It was odd that she wasn't on the list before, but now it was even stranger that she jumped to the top.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne quickly stopped overthinking it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa's rise to the top at least confirmed Osborne's assessment of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her power was indeed terrifying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Number one on the Global Godson Rankings... Even if I reach AAA class, I won't be able to beat her. I need to figure out a way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"At the very least, I need to make my domain stronger!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fueled by fighting spirit, Osborne vowed to catch up to Isa's strength as quickly as possible. Only by defeating her could he truly dominate her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is there no one else to challenge?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Jackie spoke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If that's the case, today's battles are over. Tomorrow at the Honor Quest Ceremony, I hope everyone shines and reaps rewards."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Jackie left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne, along with Emma and Stuart, returned to their courtyard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, thank you for today. If you hadn't stepped in, I would've been dead, and Rhett would've been humiliated, unable to get revenge! I used to say bad things about you and even challenged you, but now I realize how big the gap is between us. I apologize."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart bowed respectfully to Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's ranking on the Godson Rankings was now 565. Stuart was convinced of his strength after defeating Andrew, Emi, and Takashi.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Osborne was only at AA class, no one dared to underestimate him anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need to be so formal. I didn't mind."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled. "You've got talent, but you lack real combat experience, and your temper is too hot. If you can fix that, I'm sure you'll make it into the Godson Rankings."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart nodded seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I know I was wrong. I'll definitely change!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After talking with Stuart, Osborne returned to his room. Soon after, Emma came in, beaming at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, you were amazing today!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled and said, "Once you master your domain, you'll easily make it into the Godson Rankings. You've got a shot at the top ten with your talent."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing that, Emma's face lit up with pride.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course! I'm not worse than anyone except you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After speaking, she looked mischievous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, let's keep going. If we have a couple more rounds, I'll master my domain quickly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The special energy in my Death's Stare will fade sooner or later. We should make the most of it now and use it to boost our strength."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she said this, Emma wrapped her arms around Osborne's neck, eyes filled with desire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne swallowed hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, let's do it!"</p><div class="pagination">
