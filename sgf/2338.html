  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Alba, who exactly wants to kill Dark Phoenix?" Angela continued to ask.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana replied, "You don't need to ask. Even if I tell you, you wouldn't know them. Besides, this isn't something at your level to handle. Anyway, after the state duel ends, whether Osborne wins or loses, take Osborne and leave immediately to avoid getting involved."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela bit her lip and finally nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But after a while, she still asked worriedly, "Ms. Alba, will this affect Fairy Moon Sect?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course it will." This time, Adriana's voice turned serious. "This isn't just about the Ember Phoenix Clan on Racial Convergence Planet, it's also about the Glorious Divine Kingdom, and even the entire Racial Convergence Planet. If this matter isn't handled well, the whole Racial Convergence Planet could face problems. But you don't need to worry too much, someone will take care of it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I understand." Angela took a deep breath. Since Adriana had said so, she decided not to dwell on the topic any further.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, she wasn't familiar with Agatha and had no friends in the Ember Phoenix Clan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela changed the topic and said, "Ms. Alba, you just mentioned that Osborne still has a chance to defeat Dark Phoenix. What do you mean? That's Dark Phoenix. In the cosmos, Dark Phoenix and Celestial Progeny are on the same level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne's cultivation level is not as high as Dark Phoenix's. How could he possibly win?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He has a chance," Adriana said calmly, "Dark Phoenix has just awakened, and her Dark Phoenix Flame hasn't fully ignited yet. At this moment, she can't be considered a mature Dark Phoenix, only a juvenile."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, her Dark Phoenix Power isn't strong enough. With the strength Osborne has shown, it's indeed difficult for him to defeat Dark Phoenix in this state. But if he has some hidden powerful techniques, he has a chance to win."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hidden powerful techniques?" Angela was utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She smiled bitterly and thought, "After fighting to this extent, Osborne's displayed strength has already exceeded everyone's expectations, even shocking everyone."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How could Osborne possibly have any hidden powerful techniques left?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyway, Angela didn't quite believe it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana said, "No matter what, we'll just keep watching. It's already impressive that Osborne made it this far. Even if he loses, he's already amazed everyone."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her words made Angela nod.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela looked at the projection again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the transformation on Agatha was complete. She was feeling the sudden surge of power, sensing the Dark Phoenix Wings behind her, and a smile appeared on her face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She looked at Osborne and said in a voice only he could hear, "I want to thank you. If it weren't for you, I would have died in the seventh layer of Arctic Maw Chasm, and reviving the Dark Phoenix Bloodline would have been impossible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although you took nine drops of my Phoenix Blood, preventing me from igniting the Dark Phoenix Flame immediately, I still want to thank you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne awkwardly rubbed his nose.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha truly knew everything and said it so directly. Even though Osborne was shameless, he still felt a bit embarrassed at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, extracting Agatha's Phoenix Blood while she was frozen was indeed a bit shameless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Agatha didn&rsquo;t sound too angry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne politely said, "You were able to awaken the Dark Phoenix Bloodline because of yourself. If there were no Dark Phoenix Bloodline in your body, you wouldn't have awakened. So, you don't need to thank me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha looked at Osborne in surprise, then shook her head and said, "No. There's nothing special about my bloodline. Many in the Ember Phoenix Clan have a small amount of Dark Phoenix Bloodline like me, but no one has ever been able to activate and awaken it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At least, in these tens of thousands of years, only I have succeeded."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And the reason I succeeded is that you extracted my Phoenix Blood, used it to ignite the Dark Phoenix Flame. Then, your Dark Phoenix Flame triggered the small amount of Dark Phoenix Bloodline in me, awakening my bloodline."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, I should thank you. My Ember Phoenix Clan and I won't forget your help. If I survive, I will definitely find a chance to repay you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne looked at Agatha in surprise. "Survive? What do you mean? Is there something wrong with your body?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha shook her head, smiled, and said, "No. I feel better than ever. Forget it. Let's settle this first. I'm several times stronger now than before. If you don't have any new tricks, I'm going to win."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne immediately came to his senses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He smiled and said, "Then bring it on. Even though you've awakened the Dark Phoenix Bloodline, defeating me won't be that easy."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is that so? Then bring it on," Agatha said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the black Sacred Power around Agatha surged wildly, and the massive Dark Phoenix Wings suddenly flapped. The next second, Agatha appeared in front of Osborne, as if teleporting. Her speed was almost the same as Phantom Steps, and there was no energy fluctuation at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression changed instantly, thinking, "Her speed is so fast. However, I have Satan's Eye. If it were someone else, it might be hard to react. But with Satan's Eye, I can handle it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He suddenly threw a punch while quickly retreating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the next moment, the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute in Agatha's hand, infused with black Sacred Power, smashed into Osborne's body, shattering it to pieces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, that was just an illusion Osborne left behind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's body had already moved away. His fist power struck Agatha, but it was easily blocked by the Phoenix Skeletal Shield surrounding her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the influence of the Dark Phoenix Bloodline, the Phoenix Skeletal Shield became more agile and its defense stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's fist power could no longer penetrate the Phoenix Skeletal Shield.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Osborne's expression grow serious. He knew that only by creating distance and combining the Bloodwrought Bow with the Divine Ascendance Technique could he possibly defeat Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Agatha clearly knew this as well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Until now, Osborne had only revealed the Bloodwrought Bow as his sole Sacred Artifact. Its immense power was something even the transformed Dark Phoenix Agatha feared. So, she gave Osborne no chance to create distance. She gently flapped her Dark Phoenix Wings, and no matter how hard Osborne tried, he couldn't widen the gap between them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because the distance was too close, Osborne couldn't use the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two figures moved rapidly, clashing repeatedly. The terrifying power erupted, making it impossible for the onlookers to see clearly. At this moment, they could only stare wide-eyed in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man sighed, "They're so strong."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another person agreed, "It's understandable that Agatha is so strong, after all, she awakened the Dark Phoenix Bloodline. But Osborne lasting this long without losing, and even counterattacking, is incredible."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne and Agatha collided head-on. Instantly, Osborne's face turned pale, blood trickled from the corner of his mouth, and his expression grew even more serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the confined space of Arctic Maw Chasm, even with spatial power, he couldn't create distance from Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "This is a bit troublesome."</span></p><div class="pagination">
