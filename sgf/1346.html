  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the dust settled on the battlefield, Osborne surveyed the desolate scene, finally allowing himself to exhale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle had started off smoothly, but it had taken a turn for the chaotic. Once the Dark Deity Legion realized they had no hope of survival, they fought back fiercely, creating significant trouble for Osborne and the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their frantic attempts to escape, they unleashed a final wave of retaliation that caught many off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their best efforts, over a hundred Blood Demon warriors fell victim to the desperate onslaught of the Dark Deity Legion, their Divine Bodies exploding into a gruesome spray of blood and flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The devastation was staggering, with much of </span><span>Lordia</span><span> Land reduced to ruins. Countless innocent civilians had perished in the chaos, victims of the Dark Deity Legion's vengeful strikes as they fled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a pang of helplessness wash over him, but there was little he could do about it now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least it was all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood with the Blood Demon forces and the fewer than twenty warriors from the Prophet Alliance, having collectively wiped out over one hundred and fifty Transcendent Deities and more than a thousand Superior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not a single soul had escaped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With all the blood energy collected, Osborne felt a surge of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The blood energy from just one Transcendent Deity can elevate ten Blood Demon members from Intermediate Deity to Superior Deity. And the energy from a Superior Deity can push an Intermediate Deity up to the next level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With one hundred fifty Transcendent Deities and over a thousand Superior Deities here, we've got enough energy to boost more than two thousand five hundred Blood </span><span>Demon members to Superior Deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Our strength is about to skyrocket!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Killing and collecting blood energy during the war is the best way for the Blood Demon members to rapidly increase their power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's a cycle of war feeding war!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with the top warriors of the Dark Deity Legion, Pantheon League, and </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization eliminated and the Lord League completely wiped out, the power dynamics on Blue Planet had shifted dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the Augustine family and the Prophet Alliance remained as dominant forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the Prophet Alliance didn't seem particularly strong in Osborne's eyes. They had kept a low profile for years and showed no interest in world domination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After witnessing the might of Osborne and the Blood Demon members firsthand, it was unlikely they would entertain such ambitions anytime soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Osborne, this meant Blue Planet was no longer a threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All that remained was to clean up the remnants of the major powers, and peace would once again reign.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family would rise to power in this restored peace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First things first, I need to bring back the fallen Blood Demon members," Osborne murmured to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over a hundred Blood Demon warriors had been killed during the battle, but they hadn't truly perished. Their bodies were protected by the roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, allowing them to be revived at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Osborne needed to harness the Lotus' power to restore their Divine Bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a hum, the hundred-plus roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity began to tremble, drawing in the energy of the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slowly, translucent forms began to materialize in the void, coalescing as the energy gathered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the power intensified, Divine Bones, Divine Flesh, veins, and blood rapidly reformed, and soon, the once ethereal bodies solidified into complete Divine Bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the process came to a halt, over a hundred Blood Demon members opened their eyes in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been revived!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So that's what the resurrection process looks like!" Osborne murmured, captivated by the sight before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time any Blood Demon member had died in battle, and it was his first experience witnessing their revival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole scenario felt nothing short of miraculous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once revived, the Blood Demon members appeared just as they had before, their memories intact, and surprisingly, their Divine Bodies seemed even stronger than they had been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but gawk at the transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Reviving them after death not only brings them back but somehow makes their Divine Bodies even more powerful? If they could die and come back a few more times, wouldn't they just undergo a transformation and rise in rank?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If only I could try it! Unfortunately, I've only completed the fourth level of fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, which limits the number of times they can be revived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Blood Demon members have even fewer opportunities; after all, each resurrection consumes energy from the Lotus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing that encouraging repeated deaths for the sake of strength was a futile pursuit, Osborne redirected his focus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He instructed the Blood Demon members to return to the Dimensional Microcosm and began transmitting the accumulated blood energy through the roots of the Lotus, channeling it directly into their bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this infusion of blood energy, most of the Blood Demon members would soon break through to become Superior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was settling into a rhythm, Eddie and the others from the Prophet Alliance arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In perfect unison, they bowed deeply before Osborne, their respect evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Greetings, Godfather," they said, their voices steady and sincere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, their reverence wasn't merely a formality dictated by the Grand Elder of the Prophet Alliance; it stemmed from a genuine acknowledgment of Osborne's formidable strength.</span></p><div class="pagination">
