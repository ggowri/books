  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The diamond Osborne gave to Alison was perfect in shape. It did not require any cutting, only polishing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the diamond shone a brilliant light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the light, all kinds of fantasy colors flashed so brightly that it was difficult to open one's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's so beautiful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison held the diamond carefully, and she was reluctant to let it go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was also amazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the diamond before polishing was also very transparent and beautiful, it was entirely incomparable for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder that all women in the world cannot resist a dazzling diamond. It is indeed beautiful. Clarissa will be very happy to receive it," thinking, Osborne smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, where are you going to inlay it? This diamond is big. But it's too big to be easily inlaid. It can't be used to make a necklace, ring, or earrings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If display it alone, it will be a bit boring. It needs more embellishment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Alison's words, Osborne started thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where do you think it can be inlaid?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Osborne asked Alison back. After all, Alison was a top designer who had been studying jewelry all her life. She was a professional.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison smiled confidently, "Mr. Augustine, a diamond this big can only be inlaid in a crown, a scepter, or a sword handle or scabbard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since it's a gift for your girlfriend, it can only be inlaid on the crown. As it happens, I designed a women's crown not long ago. Its gorgeousness is not inferior to the inherited crown of the Queen of </span><span>Yalynch</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is decorated with two heart-shaped gems made of Imperial Green diamonds on the side. Each of them is worth hundreds of millions of dollars and is of the right size. There are also dozens of various top-quality gems. But the main seat has always been vacant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was worried about what kind of gemstone to inlay on the main seat to match it. Now, with this diamond, it is simply perfect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just need to change it a little bit, and it will be done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison seemed very excited at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This diamond was so perfect that she had no room to design it and no sense of involvement. But it would be different if it could be inlaid in a </span><span>crown</span><span> she designed herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison was highly confident that with just this crown, she would become the most famous jewelry designer in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Wealthy people from all over the world will flock to me and ask me to design jewelry for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna Jewelry will also be more famous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, how could Alison not be excited?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was also looking forward to it. "Then inlay it on the crown you designed. I believe in you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Augustine. You are the best boss in the world!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne agree, Alison jumped up happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She excitedly hugged Osborne's neck, standing on tiptoe and kissing Osborne on the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, you are so handsome today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alison ran away with the diamond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wiped the saliva from his face, looking helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Why are all these women around me like female hooligans?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waited patiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, the servants of the Caldwell family and the Ashford family were busy in the Rose Castle, making preparations for the wedding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rose Castle was huge, consisting of a main castle and nine secondary castles. It was located in the south of </span><span>Mayby</span><span> City, next to the beautiful Moon Lake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This ancient castle had a history of more than a thousand years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hundred years ago, Rose Castle had belonged to the Sinclair family. After the War of Madness, the Sinclair family had been destroyed, and The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> had occupied Rose Castle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> had been defeated by the Godfather and driven out of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>. The Rose Castle then became the Godfather's property and was managed by the Draco Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, the Rose Castle was transformed by the Draco Group into a huge hotel that would host some large-scale reception events, weddings, and international conferences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cost of booking the entire venue was prohibitive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the Ashford family was wealthy, they still felt incredibly overwhelmed by the money they spent to book the Rose Castle for Wesley and Ophelia to hold their wedding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were still two hours before the wedding started.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But many guests had already arrived. All of these guests were members of the upper class, or at least celebrities or wealthy businessmen. Otherwise, they would not even have an invitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost all the wealthy families in </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> received invitations from the Ashford family and the Caldwell family. Even if the heads of these families did not come in person, they at least sent their heirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the six ancient families in </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> would send representatives to attend the wedding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, all the underworld gangs in </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> also received invitations and sent people here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Mayby</span><span> City became extremely lively because of this wedding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley and Ophelia, both dressed in their best clothes, now stood in front of the door of the castle to personally welcome the guests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia was extremely excited when she saw the big shots attending her wedding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "This is the wedding I want!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia was delighted, thinking, "I married Osborne, that loser, without even having a wedding. Luckily, I have divorced him! Only Wesley is worthy of me and is my true love!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, will you come?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If you really come and see how grand my wedding is, you will feel inferior."</span></p><div class="pagination">
