  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne unleashed his powers with effortless grace and breakneck speed. With a mere thought, he could unleash multiple types of power attacks simultaneously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thousands of flying Ferocious Beasts surrounding him were unable to breach his web of attacks; they fell one after another, their bodies either plummeting to the ground or vanishing into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a surge of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he knew that his true strength lay not in these flashy power attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they were impressive and effective against foes of similar or lesser strength, they would be insufficient against a true master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His greatest assets were his body&mdash;his raw strength, defense, and speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now was the time to test just how much he had improved during his three-month slumber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne retracted his power attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that brief moment, he had already taken down over five thousand flying beasts, but nearly 10 thousand still remained, a daunting sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne withdrew his power attacks, the remaining beasts surged toward him once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looking for trouble, are we?" Osborne sneered, a confident grin spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He unleashed his martial art aura, enveloping himself in a fierce energy, and charged headlong into the throng of beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was close-quarters combat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, be careful!" Anastasia and Zoe gasped, their faces paling in alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of him plunging into such a mass of flying beasts was terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would dare to dive into the heart of a beast swarm?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a distance, he could use power attacks to whittle down their numbers, and if things got dicey, he could always retreat or fight while backing away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But charging into the pack meant he'd be surrounded, and that was a death wish!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did Osborne have to endure countless attacks simultaneously, but he also couldn't effectively dodge or retreat. Even the most formidable individuals would eventually be worn down and defeated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though these flying Ferocious Beasts were relatively weak, every single attack would chip away at Osborne's defenses. One beast might not break through, but what about a thousand, or 10 thousand, or even 100 thousand?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how strong his defenses were, they could eventually wear him down, </span><span>leaving him vulnerable to being torn apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the terrifying nature of a beast swarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An army of ants could take down an elephant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia and Zoe were frantic, their fear momentarily forgotten as they readied themselves to help Osborne. They were determined to jump in and </span><span>pull him out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, Osborne's calm and confident voice reached their ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need to worry, I'm fine! They can't touch me. I just want to test my physical strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Anastasia and Zoe hesitated, their instincts screaming at </span><span>them to act, yet they held back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Concern etched on their faces, they prepared themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne showed any signs of faltering under the onslaught, they would rush in without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But fate had other plans; it seemed they wouldn't get that chance after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne plunged into the swarming horde of flying Ferocious Beasts, letting their relentless attacks rain down on his martial art aura. The aura, faintly glowing with a crimson hue, effortlessly deflected every assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Be it a mere hatchling or a seasoned veteran among the beasts; none could dent Osborne's formidable defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hundreds, even thousands of attacks converging on his aura scarcely made a dent, scarcely sapping its resilience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If anything, the regeneration of his aura kept pace with the onslaught, rendering Osborne effectively invincible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could stand still all day, and not a single one of these 10 thousand beasts would breach his martial art aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle at this realization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Compared to three months ago, my martial art aura's grown even tougher! Now, even the top-tier Class S warriors would find it hard to break through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe only a true deity could manage it... and even then, they'd have to contend with my bodily defenses!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, he abruptly retracted his martial art aura, letting the barrage of attacks land directly on his skin and flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roaring explosions filled the air as the beasts closed in, claws and beaks ripping at him, while others launched condensed air blades from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thousands of attacks thudded against Osborne, yet none could leave a mark. Not a single scratch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne threw a single punch. Instantly, the force erupted, vaporizing hundreds of the beasts into crimson mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn, this is powerful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hovered mid-air, absorbing the assaults from all directions, his spirits soaring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Both my defense and strength have skyrocketed tenfold compared to three months ago! Speed and reflexes have at least tripled!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overall, my power's at least a hundred times greater now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though I'm still technically a top-tier Class S, I could take on a hundred of them </span><span>simultaneously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And if I ever cross paths with a true deity, I'd dare to face them head-on!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
