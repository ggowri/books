  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle on the Mystic Feather Clan's floating mountain was beyond ferocious, with warriors falling left and right in a chaotic display of power. Deity Kings clashed, creating a spectacle that most people had never witnessed before, shaking Wild Flame City to its core with thunderous roars and violent tremors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Citizens from all factions gathered to witness the chaos unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who were weaker or </span><span>more timid</span><span> kept their distance, afraid to get caught in the crossfire and unintentionally meet their end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the powerful and bold crept closer to the mountain, eager to catch sight of the battle's progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air around the floating mountain was thick with onlookers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear to everyone: the Mystic Feather Clan was doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As one of the ten Upper Races, the Mystic Feather Clan held significant power in Wild Flame City</span><span>, </span><span>only slightly weaker than the Demonic Dragon Clan. Typically, even the Demonic Dragon Clan wouldn't dare to engage them in open conflict; the cost of victory would be too steep, risking heavy losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the current situation was different. The Bowman family spearheaded the assault, joined by the Demonic Dragon Clan and Soaring Lion Clan. The combined strength of these three factions vastly overshadowed that of the Mystic Feather Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mystic Feather Clan couldn't hold their ground!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After enduring the relentless bombardment from four Malevolence Airships, they suffered catastrophic losses, including the deaths of hundreds of thousands of their ordinary clan members. Even as the Mystic Feather Clan united in a desperate defense under the leadership of the 11 Deity King warriors, they continued to lose powerful fighters against opponents that were simply too strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's over for the Mystic Feather Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who would've thought the Mystic Feather Clan in Wild Flame City would collude with those lowly humans, betraying the esteemed Lord Malevolence? Now that the Paramount Supreme Clan has personally stepped in, they deserve to be wiped out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Facing the punishment from the Paramount Supreme Clan, they still dare to resist? What fools!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've always had a bone to pick with the Mystic Feather Clan! Once, I had a human slave who didn't listen, and when I taught him a lesson, Mystic Feather Clan members scolded me for it! He was my slave</span><span>. </span><span>I can do what I want with him! Who gave them the right to meddle?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before, I had to pretend to submit out of respect for their power. But now, seeing them on the brink of destruction fills me with joy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've suspected their collusion with the Human Community for ages!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They deserve to be annihilated!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the crowd murmured and gossiped, many wore expressions of schadenfreude. Only a handful of members from the Human Community, who had once benefited from the Mystic Feather Clan, watched with compassion as their benefactors faced ruin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, their low strength and status rendered them powerless to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, no one was inclined to lend a hand to the Mystic Feather Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could they go up against the Paramount Supreme Clan, the so-called king of Celestara?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was simply no way anyone could assist the Mystic Feather Clan in this dire situation, nor did they possess the capability to do so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense battle continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even as the Mystic Feather Clan attempted to rally and fight back, the speed at which they fell was only slowed, not stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If things kept up like this, their fate was grim</span><span>, </span><span>total annihilation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden scream pierced through the chaos. Maxime, the strongest warrior of the Mystic Feather Clan, was hurled backward, crashing violently onto the floating mountain with a force that sent shockwaves through the entire structure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The floating mountain swayed precariously in the air, on the verge of collapse under the unrelenting onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxime crashed into the floating mountain, creating a gaping hole as he coughed up blood uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had lost! In his duel with Aldrich, he had barely registered any resistance</span><span>, </span><span>no </span><span>match whatsoever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich was just too powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a mid-stage Deity King, his strength dwarfed that of an early-stage Deity King like Maxime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair flooded through Maxime's being; he knew the Mystic Feather Clan was finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Aldrich loomed over him, a disdainful sneer etched across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!" he declared, raising his hand to strike Maxime down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the death of the Wild Flame City Mystic Feather Clan's strongest warrior, their morale would surely crumble, making their total annihilation that much easier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxime braced himself for impact, certain this was the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a figure sprang forward, intercepting Aldrich's attack just in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Raoul!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxime's eyes widened in disbelief. "Raoul?! You didn't leave? You came to save me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regret washed over Maxime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had believed Raoul's words earlier, perhaps the Mystic Feather Clan wouldn't have been in such dire straits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Raoul, I'm so sorry! I let down the Mystic Feather Clan. I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raoul cut him off. "This isn't the time for apologies!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What matters now is figuring out how to keep as many of our people alive as possible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Raoul turned his gaze squarely on Aldrich.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aldrich! We, the Mystic Feather Clan of Wild Flame City, have not betrayed Lord Malevolence! Yet here you are, part of the Paramount Supreme Clan, seeking our extinction! You will reap what you sow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aldrich's response was immediate, a mocking laugh escaping his lips. "You're simply asking for death!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
