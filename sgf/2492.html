  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You have one minute to decide! After that, if you still refuse to surrender and hand over the treasures and resources, I will order all warships to open fire!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When we all attack together, you will surely die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The leader of the Skull Pirates was an extremely thin man. His gaze was gloomy and icy. At this moment, he stood at the front with his arms crossed, staring excitedly and greedily at Angela's Mid-grade Sacred Artifact warship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt he was finally going to own it!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Stellar Region M72, with a Mid-grade Sacred Artifact warship, his Skull Pirates could be considered an upper-middle-tier pirate group. Then, he could finally go after many targets he previously didn&rsquo;t dare to touch.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the speed of a Mid-grade Sacred Artifact warship is very fast, allowing better pursuit of prey. This way, they wouldn&rsquo;t always have to wait for their prey to enter their encirclement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, even if the prey is very powerful, with a Mid-grade Sacred Artifact warship, they could escape much faster.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The safety of their pirate group would be greatly enhanced.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he already considered the Mid-grade Sacred Artifact warship his trophy. He had begun to imagine riding it, roaming freely in Stellar Region M72, plundering any prey he desired.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for Angela, Osborne, and Agatha on the warship, he didn&rsquo;t take them seriously at all!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although the three of them had altered their appearances, they still looked young, as if they were disciples from a prestigious sect out on training. One had reached mid Empyrean Sacredness, another primary Empyrean Sacredness, and one wasn&rsquo;t even at Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, the pirate leader showed no fear!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If they dare to resist, we'll launch a direct assault and kill them all!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they surrender, we'll take the loot first, then kill them afterward!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>We'll just toss their bodies into the vast cosmos!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sneered, "Decide within a minute!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You have fifty seconds left!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, aboard the battleship, Osborne coldly stared at the leader of the Skull Pirates.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, I'll go out and kill him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Angela spoke, furious, "He wants to plunder us, then he must pay with his life!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stopped her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No need to bother! Even if you can take him out quickly, you'll easily get surrounded. There are over twenty Sacred Artifact battleships nearby. Though they're low-grade, if they fire together, they can still pose a threat to you!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let me handle him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he directly drew the Bloodwrought Bow, his eyes revealing excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The pirate leader's cultivation level is mid Empyrean Sacredness!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He is a worthy opponent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During the zone duel, Osborne had lost interest in facing opponents of the same cultivation level because, in his view, their strength was too weak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even prodigies like Valentino and Brenda seemed weak in Osborne's eyes. If he wanted, he could easily defeat them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even for his self-created Solar Sacred Arrow&mdash;Human Arrow, Earth Arrow, and Heaven Arrow&mdash;he only needed to use the weakest, Human Arrow, to easily defeat any opponent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He doesn't even need to use the Earth Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Opponents of the same cultivation level could no longer put any pressure on Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, facing the leader of the Skull Pirates, a mid Empyrean Sacredness warrior, he felt a long-lost desire for battle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He's worthy of me using the Earth Arrow!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A radiant Sacred Power Arrow had quickly formed on his Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the Sacred Power Arrow was unusual. There was no intense Sacred Power fluctuation on the arrow, as Osborne had compressed the Sacred Power using special techniques.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only when the arrow hit the enemy would the Sacred Power erupt instantly!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is the Earth Arrow!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Human Arrow can push Osborne's Sacred Power to the limit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the Earth Arrow compresses the Sacred Power, making the arrow more powerful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While compressing, the Heaven Arrow also absorbs the power of heaven and earth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You have thirty seconds left!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the leader of the Skull Pirates had no idea that danger was approaching. He could see Osborne drawing the Bloodwrought Bow and aiming at him, but he didn't care at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead, a mocking and sarcastic expression appeared on his face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Empyrean Sacredness warriors are all capable. You actually dare to make a move against me. Although you've gained Sacred Power early and can be considered a genius, I am a mid Empyrean Sacredness warrior!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your Sacred Power is so weak. Even if I stand here without moving and let you shoot, you wouldn't pose the slightest threat to me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The pirate leader still crossed his arms, his face full of disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, the other Skull Pirates also burst into laughter, their faces filled with disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He still looks like he wants to resist!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But he's simply overestimating himself! He hasn't even reached Empyrean Sacredness. And he dares to make a move against our leader? Ridiculous! He's angered our leader, and he's doomed! I'll definitely skin him alive and hang him on the warship."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The pirates were all laughing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Sacred Power Arrow on Osborne's Bloodwrought Bow had such faint Sacred Power fluctuations that they felt no threat at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In such a situation, he held back his laughter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Solar Sacred Arrow, Earth Arrow, fire an arrow!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the brilliant Sacred Power Arrow shot out, heading straight for the pirate leader.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as it left the Bloodwrought Bow, it suddenly vanished, entering the Dimensional Space. In an instant, it traversed the space and appeared before the pirate leader.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A disdainful smile still hung on his face at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, his smile froze. Clearly, he hadn't expected Osborne's Sacred Power Arrow to perform interdimensional travel and instantly appear before him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The speed was simply too fast!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The pirate leader hadn't reacted at all before the Sacred Power Arrow struck his Sacred Power Defense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, the compressed power suddenly erupted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a thunderous boom, the terrifying explosion instantly engulfed the pirate leader. His Sacred Power Defense was shattered, offering no protection at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, he didn't take Osborne seriously, so his defense was naturally not very thorough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And this led to his death!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The terrifying power of the Earth Arrow explosion unleashed all the elemental forces within Osborne's Sacred Power, easily corroding the pirate leader's skin, tearing apart his flesh, and obliterating his bones.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that moment, within the silent and dim cosmos, it was as if a fleeting starlight appeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The pirate leader standing there had completely vanished!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everything about him was completely crushed into the most basic particles in Osborne's Earth Arrow explosion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only a dead silence remained.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, seeing the pirate leader shot dead with a single arrow, leaving not even a corpse behind, the pirates who had been laughing and mocking Osborne's overconfidence were all frozen in place, their eyes wide with shock and fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Angela and Agatha behind Osborne were stunned at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They both knew he was strong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, he couldn't have emerged victorious all the way from the sect duel, city duel, state duel, and zone duel, winning championships in all of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela and Agatha both knew that Osborne already had the strength to surpass and defeat ordinary Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But they never expected his strength to have reached such a level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He killed a mid Empyrean Sacredness warrior with a single arrow?!</span></p><div class="pagination">
