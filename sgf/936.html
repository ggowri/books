  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, "Ms. Hernandez, please take them back to the Campbell headquarters. They're seriously injured and need medical attention right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I still have to go save others."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way! We can't let you head off alone," Serena replied, her tone laced with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head firmly. "Listen, Ms. Hernandez, I'm more effective on my own. If I run into trouble, I can escape more swiftly. You all should head back to headquarters, gather any surviving members of the Draco Armed Services Branch, and organize a rescue and defense effort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll coordinate with the Blood Demon members once they arrive, and if I encounter any enemies I can't handle, I'll reach out for help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Serena could voice any further objections, Osborne tore open a dimensional rift, vanishing before their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena and the others were left helpless, unable to argue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's current strength had far surpassed theirs; even if they combined their efforts, they couldn't hope to contain him if he really wanted to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena sighed, resignation creeping into her voice, "Forget it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With Osborne's power right now, following him would only drain his resources. We wouldn't be able to assist him that much anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's hurry to the Dampston headquarters!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This Aberrant war isn't just about capturing the six coastal provinces. They'll likely push deeper inland, possibly all the way to Newport City, aiming to control all of Rosmandi!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have to set up a defensive line as soon as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Serena and her team, using their powers to support the injured eight, hastened toward the Campbell headquarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, miles away, Osborne had already covered several thousand miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long before, a tight-knit squad of just over a hundred from the Draco Group had found themselves cornered and chased by the Aberrants during their flight for safety. The enemy's overwhelming strength left them no choice but to call for backup from headquarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Osborne arrived at the spot where they had sent their distress signal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a quiet mountain area, eerily still.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the clear signs of battle were unmistakable; blood stained the ground, and lifeless bodies lay among the thorns, all clad in Draco Armed Services Branch uniforms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned frosty as he glanced toward a nearby valley, knowing too well what had transpired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The evidence pointed to a hasty retreat into the valley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faint sounds of conflict echoed from within, sending adrenaline coursing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Osborne charged into the valley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The closer he got, the louder the deafening sounds of battle became. Just a few miles ahead, he could see two factions engaged in an all-out war.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One side comprised around sixty to seventy fighters in Draco Armed Services Branch uniforms, most possessing Class AA strength, with a handful reaching Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they hung on the precipice of desperation, each one battered and injured because their opponents were just too strong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon spotting their enemies, Osborne frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The opposing force, though fewer in number&mdash;about fifty&mdash;were all Class AAA clones, including notable figures like Duke Medusa, Duke Werewolf, Duke Tauren, Duke Titan, and Duke of Blood Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it had only been fifty Class AAA clones, Osborne wouldn't have been as perturbed; with his current abilities, he could take them on or, at the very least, put a serious dent in their ranks without putting himself in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What truly unsettled him were the three signatures he felt among them&mdash;three powerful presences that radiated strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were Class S clones!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One belonged to the Medusa Queen, another to the Wolf King, and the last to the Tauren King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gerardo, he's finally done it! He's really cloned a complete Class S clone. This is a big trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was somewhat grim at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Aberrants was already incredibly powerful, and because of cloning, their number of strong fighters far exceeded that of the Augustine family and the Draco Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, when Gerardo could only clone up to Class AAA, the situation was still manageable. Despite the power gap, it wasn't an impossible fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Gerardo had successfully cloned a Class S!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The balance of power had shifted completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Gerardo cloned tens or even hundreds of Class S clones, even if these Class S clones were the weakest among their kind, the Aberrants would still be able to sweep most superpowers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least the Augustine family and the Draco Group couldn't stop them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're in trouble," Osborne muttered, but he didn't dwell on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he didn't intervene now, the remaining sixty or seventy members of the Draco Armed Services Branch would be wiped out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three Class S clones, backed by fifty Class AAA clones, were too strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Draco Armed Services Branch members were being killed every moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three Class S, huh? Let's see if I can handle three Class S at the same time now!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
