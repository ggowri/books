  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Osborne made his way through the dimly lit dungeon corridor, he noticed Divine Shadow's ears perk up. The cat lifted its head, its curious eyes scanning the surroundings, glinting with a spark of intrigue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne didn't think much of it, quickly reaching the depths of the dungeon where he found the God of Star.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The God of Star appeared as a shimmering soul, devoid of a physical form, but he looked weaker than before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"God of Star, what's wrong?" Osborne asked, concern etched on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The God of Star waved a hand dismissively, a faint smile gracing his features. "Oh, it's nothing. I'm not dead yet! Those two top-notch Class S assassins were quite a handful. I had to push myself a bit harder to deal with them, and it took a toll on my condition."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne felt a wave of gratitude wash over him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it hadn't been for the God of Star holding off Sin and Crimson during the attack on the Augustine family, things could have turned dire before he even had the chance to return.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He quickly placed Divine Shadow on his shoulder and bowed respectfully to the God of Star.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thank you, God of Star. The Augustine family will never forget your kindness."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't mention it," the God of Star replied casually, but his gaze shifted to Divine Shadow, surprise flickering in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, he frowned tightly, as if lost in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Divine Shadow merely glanced at the God of Star before settling back down on Osborne's shoulder, curling up to sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Noticing the God of Star's unusual reaction, Osborne quickly asked, "God of Star? What's going on? Why are you looking at Divine Shadow like that? Do you know it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The God of Star shook his head. "I don't know it! It's just... it feels extraordinary."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Extraordinary is an understatement!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne quickly launched an explanation of Divine Shadow's background. As he spoke, the God of Star's expression grew increasingly serious. Just as he was about to respond, Divine Shadow lifted its head again, casting another glance at the God of Star.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The God of Star's mouth fell open in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong, God of Star?" Osborne asked, concern creeping back in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The God of Star hurriedly shook his head, urgency in his voice. "No! It's nothing! It truly is remarkable, but that's not a bad thing. Just treat it well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seemingly eager to change the subject, the God of Star continued, "You're here to see the Fatebearer, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Her talent is even better than I expected. I originally thought it would take her seven days to transform and break through to AAA level, but after only four days, she has already broken through! Now, she is already AAA level."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What? Clarissa is already Class AAA?" Osborne exclaimed, his excitement palpable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The God of Star nodded, but his expression darkened. "She is indeed Class AAA now, but she hasn't awakened yet. It seems her body is undergoing some kind of transformation, and I can't quite figure out why."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's heart sank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "Clarissa has broken through to AAA but hasn't woken up? Is she in danger?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The God of Star reassured him, sensing his anxiety, "Don't worry!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"While I don't know why she hasn't awakened, I can feel that she's not in any danger. In fact, her fate power is rapidly increasing, which is beneficial for both her and you!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, for now, we just wait for her to wake up?" Osborne asked, relief washing over him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Exactly," the God of Star confirmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a sigh of relief, Osborne made his way to the stone chamber where Clarissa was meditating. He checked her condition, ensuring she was indeed safe, and only then did he fully relax, knowing she was on the path to greatness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"God of Star, how long do you think it'll be before Clarissa wakes up? The Augustine family is in a precarious situation right now. I need to break through to Class S as soon as possible if I want to stand a chance."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This time, God of Star shook his head, looking somber.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can't say! She might wake up any second, or it could take three days, maybe even five. But rest assured, the moment she stirs, I'll let you know right away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne sighed, nodding in resignation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "It seems my breakthrough to Class S is going to be delayed. I can only hope the Augustine family stays out of trouble in the meantime. Otherwise..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, his Draco Star Wristlet vibrated sharply, flashing an urgent message.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he glanced at it, his expression hardened dramatically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Lambert family is in trouble! What? The Eityreia Organization is attacking the Lambert family?! And Aleena is reaching out to the Augustine family for help?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A deep frown settled on Osborne's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Lambert family was a Secluded Family, a major power in their own right, and their ties with the Augustine family had been strong for centuries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aleena had always been a close ally and a friend to Caleb.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just recently, when Osborne had been planning to attend Cuthbert's Honor Quest Ceremony in Tethynia, it was Aleena who helped him disguise himself as a Lambert family member at Caleb's request.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, she was asking the Augustine family for rescue because the Lambert family was being besieged by a group of assassins from the Eityreia Organization!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Should I go and help them?" Osborne pondered, caught in a dilemma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Augustine family could barely hold its ground as it was. However, recalling Aleena's previous support and the fact that she was a friend of Caleb weighed heavily on his heart. Caleb had sacrificed himself not long ago to save him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, determination surged through Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I have to go! I can't leave them to fend for themselves!"</p><div class="pagination">
