  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two cars pulled up outside the small courtyard, and three people, a man and two women, stepped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the men was older, around his forties. His face was expressionless, but his eyes held a glint of confidence and pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other two appeared to be in their thirties and exuded an equally powerful aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trio looked around the courtyard with calm expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the window, Osborne spotted them and exchanged a glance with Emma. He had already recognized these three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were the strongest and most gifted members of the younger generation of the Lambert family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The eldest of the three, the man in his forties, was named Rhett Lambert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the leader of the younger generation of the Lambert family and also the strongest. At forty, he had reached Class AAA eight years ago. His strength even surpassed Vincent's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man behind him was Stuart Lambert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stuart was a month younger than Osborne's disguised identity, Axell, making him thirty-five. He, too, had achieved Class AAA. His talent was exceptional, ranking him among the top three in the younger generation of the Lambert family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside them stood the woman, Fidelia Lambert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fidelia was thirty and had also reached Class AAA. Her talent was the best among the younger generation of the Lambert family, and her strength was on par with Stuart's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These three were the elite of the younger generation of the Lambert family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, they would represent the Lambert family at the Honor Quest Ceremony in Tethynia. Each of them was a potential challenger to Cuthbert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched them with a serious expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that their talent and strength were indeed extraordinary. Even within the Augustine family, there were few who could match them; even Vincent might be suppressed by them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Lambert family truly lives up to its reputation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The power of the Secluded Families is not to be underestimated!" Osborne muttered softly. With a wave of his hand, he turned the Lambert family information into ashes and, along with Emma, stepped out of the small house and into the courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three immediately turned their gaze towards them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes were filled with unfamiliarity, scrutiny, and a hint of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Rhett broke the silence, his face breaking into a slight smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Axell, Maia!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's been over a decade since we last saw you. Ever since you left the Lambert family for training, you never came back. If not for the occasional news, I would've thought you'd gone missing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rhett's attitude towards them was relatively friendly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and Emma quickly bowed in greeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rhett."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rhett."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their greetings were a bit stiff, but no one found it odd. After all, the characters they were playing hadn't been home in over a decade, so feeling estranged from family was natural.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stuart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fidelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Long time no see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne greeted the other two as calmly as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the two only nodded coldly in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't mind and turned his gaze behind Rhett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, an elderly woman stepped out of the car. She looked to be in her sixties or seventies, with slightly graying hair, but she was spirited, her energy radiating strongly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was Aleena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Aleena Lambert."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Aleena Lambert."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and Emma quickly bowed to Aleena, showing much more respect. Aleena knew they were disguised, so they weren't worried about exposing themselves in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aleena smiled and nodded. "Very good!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I haven't seen you two in over a decade, and you've both grown up nicely. Your abilities aren't bad either. You haven't brought shame to the Lambert family. This time, I'm taking Rhett, Stuart, and Fidelia to Tethynia for the Honor Quest Ceremony. When I heard you were traveling in Newport City, I decided to take you along for the experience."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded with a smile, saying little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that the more he spoke, the more likely he was to slip up, so it was better to stay aloof.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph. This is what you call 'not bad'?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Stuart spoke up, his tone filled with disdain. "Axell, you're still stuck at Class AA? You left in a hurry over a decade ago for training, and I thought you'd be stronger than those of us who stayed in the Lambert family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But here you are, still just Class AA after all these years. I'm younger than you, yet I've surpassed you and reached Class AAA! Even Fidelia, who's five years younger than you, has reached Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With your level of strength, you won't even get a chance to make a move at the Honor Quest Ceremony. You'll just embarrass us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stuart finished speaking, his face showing a look of contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was a bit taken aback. He hadn't expected Stuart to target him so directly. He frowned, unsure how to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated between ignoring Stuart and confronting him head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Osborne could decide, Emma spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said coldly, "Stuart, what are you so smug about? All you did was break through to Class AAA first. What are you bragging about in front of my brother? I thought you might've already reached Class S Supreme Overlord by now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Class AAA that impressive? I've reached Class AAA too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she spoke, she looked at Stuart with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stuart's face instantly darkened, and he glared at Emma with fury.</span></p><div class="pagination">
