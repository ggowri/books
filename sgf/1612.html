  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just because I'm also from the Human Community? Is it really that simple?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback. He was used to people like Calvin, who would take any chance to step on him simply for being human. Yet here was Diana, wanting to help him just because they shared the same background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's voice brimmed with sincerity. "Isn't that enough?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're both part of the Human Community, struggling to survive in this harsh world. Shouldn't we look out for each other?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could hear the genuine concern in her words, realizing she wasn't putting on a facade; she truly meant what she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's your story? When did you arrive at the Divine Peak Nine base?" he asked, curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana replied quickly, "I grew up here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've heard that on the day I was born, there was a strange phenomenon&mdash;golden springs burst from the ground, surrounding me as I awakened my earth elemental power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because of that, the Wild Flame Army brought me here, and I've lived under their watch ever since. Once my power grew a bit stronger, they sent me to mine Essence Crystals. I've had a lot of luck; my escort team has suffered casualties time and again, yet I've somehow survived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They started calling me a disaster, saying I was cursed! Anyone who protects me seems to face misfortune and dies quickly, while I'm fine as long as I'm left to fend for myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know why, but that's how it's been. They've kept me away from outsiders, so I've had very little contact with the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I'm right, once we reach the 53rd mining area, they'll assign you to protect me. They might even use my curse against you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was left speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Is it really like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana, cursed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people who protect her face nothing but bad luck, while she remains unharmed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at Riley and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "So, they're only focused on protecting Emmett and completely ignoring Diana?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought they looked down on her for being from the Human Community, but it seems they're just afraid of her curse affecting them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's voice interrupted his thoughts, "When we get to the 53rd mining area, remember to keep your distance. Don't get too close, or my curse might really affect you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've finally found a fellow Human Community member to talk to, and I don't want to bring you down with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied calmly, "Do you really think I can avoid it? If your suspicions are correct, Riley will likely order me to stay right by your side. If I refuse, it would be disobeying a direct order, and he wouldn't hesitate to kill me if I went against him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana fell silent again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, her voice came through, tinged with guilt. "I'm so sorry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you apologizing? This isn't your fault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not the one trying to harm me; you're just being used by them! Besides, I've always had good luck. Even if there is a curse, it might not be enough to take me down," Osborne said, trying to ease her worries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana went quiet again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could see her fists clenching. Clearly, she was still feeling guilty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's change the subject! You've been at Divine Peak Nine for a while now. You must know this place pretty well. I noticed everyone was on edge and using divine power </span><span>for protection as soon as we left the base. Just how dangerous is it out here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana finally spoke again, her tone grave, "It's extremely dangerous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once you leave the base, you're surrounded by threats at every turn! The </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> here are numerous, and their abilities are downright eerie. In their ethereal form, they can slip through soil and rock, using thick fog to conceal themselves. They could be right nearby, ready to strike at any moment, and it's tough to spot them in advance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's worse, they can perfectly disguise themselves, taking on the appearance of anyone&mdash;so realistic that even a Deity King warrior would struggle to tell the difference. You should never trust anyone easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the wild, even if the person approaching you is someone you know and trust, stay on high alert. It's best if we create a secret signal between us. If it doesn't match, it's definitely a </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> in disguise!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't believe what he was hearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> could flawlessly imitate anyone! Even a Deity King had a hard time distinguishing them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recalled the rumors he'd heard about the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> near Divine Peak&mdash;they were different from their kin elsewhere, more intelligent, and much more formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, we should decide on a signal," Diana said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure!" he replied, eager to cooperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana said, her voice brightening a bit, "Let's make ours 'Stay strong, never give up!' What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a mix of amusement and disbelief but ultimately nodded. "Alright, let's go with that."</span></p><div class="pagination">
