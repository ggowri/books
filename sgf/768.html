  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett's Flame Realm was nearly destroyed in an instant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Completely unprepared, Rhett was hit by the backlash, spitting out blood. He stared at Andrew, shock written all over his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You... you've broken through?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew sneered. "Rhett, did you think only your power would increase? Three years ago, I defeated you. Now, beating you is even easier!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you were smart, you wouldn't have challenged me. You might have stood a chance by going after someone at the bottom of the Global Godson Rankings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Too bad you're too foolish!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Challenging me was your biggest mistake! I'm tired of your challenges, so let me give you one final lesson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Andrew moved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a flash, he appeared in front of Rhett and threw a brutal punch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett tried to block it with all his might, but already injured, he couldn't hold his ground. He was blasted away, crashing onto the stage, spitting out more blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Rhett gritted his teeth and tried to get back up, Andrew appeared in front of him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew raised his foot and stomped on Rhett's head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett's head slammed hard against the stage, producing a sharp, crisp sound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett screamed in agony as blood flowed from his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet the physical pain he felt was nothing compared to the humiliation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew, stepping on his head in front of everyone, right on the stage!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grrr!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett roared with fury, trying to get up. Andrew stomped on his head again, pressing it down hard, leaving him unable to move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew sneered. "Rhett, feeling humiliated? Hahaha! Do you dare challenge me without the strength? This is what you get!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now, I'm giving you a chance to surrender!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Submit to me! Admit defeat! Then crawl off the stage like the dog you are!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying that, Andrew spat in disgust at Rhett.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett's body trembled. He had come here full of confidence, seeking revenge against Andrew and hoping to pay him back for the three years of humiliation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But instead, he was defeated even more easily, enduring an even harsher humiliation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Rhett's eyes burned red with rage and resentment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew, wanting him to surrender? To crawl off the stage like a dog?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rhett roared in anger, struggling with all his might. The more he fought, the harder Andrew pressed his foot down on his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Blood flowed rapidly from Rhett's head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other Godsons all looked at Rhett with scorn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Pathetic!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Still won't give up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're wasting everyone's time!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You've got no strength, but still keep pushing. You're clueless!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Trash!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing all the insults, Rhett grew even angrier, but there was nothing he could do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His consciousness was slowly fading.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Below the stage, Stuart and Vivian's eyes were red with tears, watching helplessly as Rhett was humiliated by Andrew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stop it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, Stuart couldn't hold back any longer and roared in anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's already lost! Why are you still humiliating him? Let him go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew looked at Stuart with disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He lost? But he hasn't surrendered or left the stage. Why should I let him go? What if he attacks me when I do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew smirked mockingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As for humiliating him? I'm stronger, and he kept challenging me recklessly. I'll humiliate him however I want! What's it to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew spat out the words dismissively, then pressed down even harder with his foot, grinding Rhett's head against the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart trembled violently with rage at the sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stop it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm surrendering on Rhett's behalf! Andrew, you've already won, so stop this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew sneered. "You're surrendering for him? Who do you think you are? Either he admits defeat himself, or you challenge me. I don't mind humiliating you too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying this, Andrew continued to humiliate Rhett.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart clenched his fists, his eyes filled with fury. At that moment, he wished he could tear Andrew apart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His anger overwhelmed his reason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fine, I'll challenge you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart roared, "Let Rhett go, and I'll fight you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vivian's expression changed immediately. "Stuart, don't be impulsive! If Rhett couldn't beat him, you don't stand a chance!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart shouted in rage, "But I can't just stand here and watch him get humiliated!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Stuart quickly charged onto the stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let him go, and I'll fight you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing this, Andrew smiled. His eyes filled with mockery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fool!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can't believe you fell for it! My fight with him isn't over, and you dare to step into the ring? You fool, you've broken the rules again. If I kill you now, you'd deserve it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as he finished speaking, Andrew suddenly attacked!</p><div class="pagination">
