  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a calm demeanor, Osborne finally spoke up, "What are you rambling about?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've wiped out all your offspring, so either fight me or beg for mercy. Your call!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Deity, still scanning the surroundings and assessing whether Osborne had allies, was taken aback by his words. Fury surged through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn! You, a Junior Deity with a Waste Divine Body, dare to provoke me? You're courting death! I'll kill you, drain your blood, and savor your flesh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the Dark Deity launched his attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words struck Osborne like a bolt of lightning. In an instant, Osborne comprehended the true situation regarding his own Divine Flame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like I've got a transparent, colorless Divine Flame hovering above me. That means my Divine Body is a Waste Divine Body, marking me as a Junior Deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason he hesitated before was probably due to the fear of my possible backup. Now, I've crossed a line that he can't ignore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, Osborne dodged the Dark Deity's assault, his speed catching the monstrous fiend off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy's fast! Is your main power tied to speed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne merely smiled as he avoided the strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer velocity he exhibited stemmed from the unparalleled strength of his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Dark Deity foolishly assumed that Osborne possessed a Waste Divine Body, but little did he know that Osborne's Divine Body was far superior, rivaling even Level Six or Level Seven Divine Bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really love to talk, don't you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's cut to the chase and end this!" Osborne said coolly, launching himself toward Dark Deity with explosive intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He delivered a punch that packed a punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Deity's anger flared at the challenge. "You think you can take me down? You? A Junior Deity with a Waste Divine Body? I've slain countless Junior Deities like you, and even if I'm not at full strength, killing you won't be a problem!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a fierce orange Ethereal Glow surged around him, radiating power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next instant, Osborne's fist connected with Dark Deity's orange Ethereal Glow, shattering it in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tremendous force slammed into the Dark Deity's chest, pulverizing half of his body with brutal efficiency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahhh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Deity's shriek echoed through the lair, twisted with disbelief. He never imagined that such a casual punch from Osborne could break through his Ethereal Glow defenses, nearly obliterating his Level Two Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His form began to contort chaotically, desperate for recovery. Blood oozed from his wounds as he fled, struggling to regain his original appearance, but he was battered and wounded, swiftly moving deeper into the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He yelled, fueled by fear and fury, "Ahhh! This can't be! You're just a Junior Deity with a Waste Divine Body! How can you have such insane power? This is impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Curious about why? Tough luck&mdash;I won't spill the beans! Now, go ahead and die quietly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, Osborne activated his Phantom Steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While not on par with interdimensional travel, the speed of Phantom Steps far surpassed Osborne's full-powered flight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, he had closed the distance to the Dark Deity, throwing another powerful punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Deity's massive form was sent flying, crashing hard into the wall and creating a huge crater upon impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire lair shook violently, debris raining down from the walls as if an earthquake had struck, furthering the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A piercing, anguished roar erupted from the Dark Deity, laced with sheer terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't comprehend how Osborne, with only a single transparent Divine Flame, could possibly wield such overwhelming strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though his powers hadn't fully returned to their peak, he was still on par with a top-tier Intermediate Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, before Osborne, he felt utterly powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What in the world is this freak?" the Dark Deity thought, panic gripping him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperate to escape, he realized with dread that Osborne was simply too fast&mdash;there was no chance to slip away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, then! I'll fight you to the bitter end!" the Dark Deity finally declared, rage bubbling over as he launched a frenzied assault at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his credit, his strength was formidable, causing the entire lair to shake violently with each blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was a tragic miscalculation; his opponent was none other than Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With an almost supernatural agility, Osborne dodged each attack with ease, either sidestepping them or shattering them with a single punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any attacks that slipped through were effortlessly blocked by his transparent Ethereal Glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair washed over the Dark Deity as he realized the hopelessness of his situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible? Your colorless Ethereal Glow... how can it possess such incredible defensive power? What kind of monster are you? This can't be real!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scoffed, amusement dancing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you, I'm not telling you anything! Who knows if you Dark Deities have some </span><span>weird way of passing messages? So, it looks like you're just going to have to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having gauged Dark Deity's strength, Osborne was done wasting time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed a finger at the Dark Deity, and with a casual flick, he invoked a devastating power. "Space Collapse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, a collapse erupted, radiating outward from the Dark Deity in a 3280-foot radius, as if the very fabric of reality was fracturing under the pressure.</span></p><div class="pagination">
