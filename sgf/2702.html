  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isidore burst into laughter upon hearing this, looking at her with disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The dozen or so Empyrean Sacredness warriors behind him also mocked Alfreda, as if looking at a fool. Even the guards of Elf City were snickering.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one took Alfreda's words seriously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Elf City is now completely under Isidore's control, with all members of the Elf Royal Family submitting to him. The entire Elf City follows his word alone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sneered, "Princess Alfreda, I'm indeed surprised you're still alive! But what surprises me even more is how foolish you've become! You want to kill me? Just you alone?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isidore wasn't afraid at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his eyes, Alfreda's cultivation level was crystal clear. As for Isa and Clarissa behind her, he assumed they were Alfreda's attendants and didn't take them seriously at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He calmly said, "It's better that you're alive! Your damned parents and brother forcibly merged with the Elven Mother Tree, ruining my plans! They're hiding inside the Elven Mother Tree, and with its power, I can't deal with them for now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Originally, I thought I'd have to wait a few more years to deal with them! But not anymore. As long as I capture you and use you to threaten your parents and brother, everything will be resolved."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Isidore waved his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Capture Princess Alfreda and take her to the Elven Mother Tree! This time, I want to see if those three bastards can still hide inside the Elven Mother Tree without coming out!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isidore sneered grimly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At his command, a group of Elf City guards immediately surrounded Alfreda, eager to capture her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Princess Alfreda, you'd better not resist, or it won't be good if we hurt you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Princess Alfreda, you better surrender obediently!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they spoke, a group of guards had already closed in.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most of them had cultivation levels of Ascension Four, Ascension Five, or even Ascension Six at the Supernal Deity King Level. With so many acting together, they were confident they could quickly subdue Alfreda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Alfreda showed no sign of panic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She simply glanced at Isa and Clarissa.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Isa, Clarissa!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Leave it to me!" Clarissa said with a smile. Facing the approaching guards, she simply waved her hand lightly, and a powerful force erupted instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All the Elf City guards were instantly sent flying, as if slammed by a solid wall. Their bones shattered, blood spurted from their mouths, and they collapsed to the ground.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were all knocked unconscious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the surroundings fell silent. The remaining guards stared at Clarissa in shock, and even Isidore showed a surprised expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"An Empyrean Sacredness warrior? And an advanced Empyrean Sacredness?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Princess Alfreda, no wonder you dare to return to Elf City to trouble me, turns out you have backing! I didn't notice before, she's actually an Empyrean Sacredness warrior!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isidore's face darkened, but he remained calm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clarissa unleashed Sacred Power, unable to hide her cultivation level any longer, which was instantly noticed by Isidore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said coldly, "So what if you're an advanced Empyrean Sacredness? I'm also an advanced Empyrean Sacredness! I have over ten Empyrean Sacredness warriors here... if you seek death, I'll grant it to you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Isidore waved his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Attack together, finish them off!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Isidore launched an attack, and the ten-plus Empyrean Sacredness warriors behind him attacked simultaneously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Isidore was still full of confidence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is Elf City, completely under his control. The defense shield of Elf City has also been activated, no one can escape anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "With so many of us, we can't handle a single advanced Empyrean Sacredness?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isidore sneered grimly, his face twisted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda felt a bit nervous. Watching Isidore lead over a dozen Empyrean Sacredness warriors and numerous Elf City warriors to attack, she couldn't help but feel worried.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clarissa smiled faintly and said, "Alfreda, don't be afraid! Even among advanced Empyrean Sacredness, there's a difference! Just watch today, we'll handle everything for you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Clarissa launched another attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She took out a Sacred Artifact, radiating terrifying power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was a Legendary Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she wielded the Sacred Artifact, a terrifying power erupted, instantly engulfing Isidore and the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isidore and the others' expressions shifted from confidence to terror. They frantically unleashed their power but couldn't withstand Clarissa's attack at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Piercing screams came from Isidore and the others. They were sent flying back even faster, crashing heavily to the ground, unable to get back up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Including Isidore, everyone clutched their chests, coughing up blood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clarissa had already been very merciful to them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, they were Alfreda's enemies, and Clarissa wanted to leave them for Alfreda to deal with personally; otherwise, they would have been killed by her long ago.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isidore looked at Clarissa in terror.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You, you..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clarissa ignored him. After dealing with Isidore and the others, she stepped back behind Alfreda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His meaning was clear: everything was left to Alfreda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda's body trembled, not from fear, but from excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She gave Clarissa a grateful look.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she coldly stared at Isidore and the others, her eyes filled with rage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The once formidable Isidore in her eyes now lay on the ground, staring at her with fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda felt absolutely thrilled!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She sneered and slowly walked toward Isidore. "Isidore, I told you before, I came back alive, and your time is up! Weren't you laughing so happily back then? Keep laughing now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isidore stared in terror as Alfred, Clarissa, and Isa approached step by step. He wanted to retreat, to run, but he couldn't move at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clarissa's control over her power was extremely precise. She didn't kill him but left him severely injured, and now he had no strength left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What... what do you want to do?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Princess Alfreda, I am your elder! You can't kill me..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda sneered with disdain, "Elder? What kind of elder are you! When you tried to harm me and Osborne, you ceased to be my elder&mdash;you became my enemy! You even imprisoned my parents and brother, torturing them. If it weren't for Osborne, they would have probably been killed by you long ago!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Right now, my parents and brother are still trapped in the Elven Mother Tree! They are completely unfit to merge with the Elven Mother Tree, and to maintain this state, they endure immense pain every single day!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I wish I could kill you right now, and you still dare to call yourself my elder? Asking me to spare you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're dreaming!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alfreda finished angrily, waved her hand to control Isidore's body, and quickly rushed toward the distant Elven Mother Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said coldly, "Isidore, you're dead!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm going to kill you in front of my parents and brother!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
