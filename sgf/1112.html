  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you doing this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo stared at Ophelia, shock and fury blazing in his eyes as if he were about to </span><span>devour her whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia had plunged a knife straight into his heart, and he hadn't seen it coming&mdash;not even a hint of danger before the blade struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo understood what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Ophelia's power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had feigned panic and fear, drawing closer until he let his guard down, and then she unleashed her time manipulation, freezing everything around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that suspended moment, Gerardo lost all awareness of his surroundings, while Ophelia, as the master of time, moved freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stepped right in front of him and drove the dagger deep into his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way to dodge this attack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only after the blade pierced his heart did his body react instinctively, unleashing a surge of power that shattered the time freeze and allowed time to flow again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Gerardo, it felt like Ophelia had materialized out of thin air, and the knife had suddenly appeared in his chest&mdash;there was no sense of time passing between.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This method of attack was faster than anything he'd ever encountered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless someone was vastly more powerful than Ophelia and could sense her time manipulation to counter it, there was no chance of evasion or defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you doing this? Why!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's voice was a low growl, his eyes burning with anger. He trembled with rage, on the verge of striking out and killing Ophelia right then and there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ophelia stood her ground with a smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't try to intimidate me! If this were any other time, even with a knife in your heart, you'd be able to kill me in an instant! But look at you now&mdash;you're in the middle of merging with a divine body, at a critical moment! You can't move, can you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words only fueled Gerardo's fury, but he couldn't deny the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was indeed immobilized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's attack had not only pierced his heart but also disrupted the fusion process he was undergoing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrible force surged within Gerardo, crashing like a tidal wave and causing intense backlash. He couldn't even lift a finger, let alone retaliate against Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at her, confusion mingling with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why? Haven't I treated you well? I took you under my wing and gave you the best training and resources! Why would you do this to me? Are you insane?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you kill me, do you really think Osborne will let you go? Who will protect you from him? Who will help you escape? Are you looking for death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia merely laughed, a mocking tone lacing her words. "You treated me well? Sure, it looked that way, but do you really think I'm that naive? You've only been grooming me for my time power, planning to strip it from me once I was strong enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's expression froze, his face darkening as her words hit home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he couldn't admit it. Gritting his teeth, he said, "Ophelia, you've got it all wrong! </span><span>How could I ever be that kind of person? Who told you this? They must be jealous of how well I've treated you, </span><span>trying to drive a wedge between us!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia rolled her eyes in disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cut the act! You're repulsive! And you really think I don't know it was you who wiped out my entire family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes turned a fierce crimson, a storm of rage and murderous intent enveloping Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For someone like Gerardo, a warrior of his caliber, the Caldwell family probably seemed utterly insignificant&mdash;he could wipe out countless more powerful families with just a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Ophelia, the Caldwell family was everything; they were her flesh and blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, the Caldwell family had its flaws, but they were her family nonetheless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Gerardo had annihilated them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had ordered the slaughter of every single member, leaving nothing but ashes in their wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fury ignited within Ophelia as she glared at Gerardo. "You old fool! Do you really think you've been discreet about this? Do you think I didn't know you were the one who wiped out the Caldwell family? You killed my family, and you expect me to keep calling you Mr. Aniston? Do you have any idea how tortured I've been during this time?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Every time I call you Mr. Aniston, it makes me sick!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I've had to hold it all back because you're just too powerful, and I'm too small. I understood that the slightest hint of defiance from me would get me killed at your hands!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I've been enduring!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I do hate Osborne. I despise how his power skyrocketed overnight after he left me, climbing to heights I can only dream of. I hate the way he's treated me so coldly and ruthlessly, even though I apologized and begged him to take me back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hate him because I love him. I want revenge, but I don't want him dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you? My hatred for you is purely about wanting to kill you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And now, I finally have my chance! It's time for you to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's grip tightened around the hilt of the knife, her resolve solidifying as she prepared to strike.</span></p><div class="pagination">
