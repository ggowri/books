  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Osborne returned to the Augustine Estate in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, he was hit with the shocking news that the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> had completely taken over </span><span>Oillpuee</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mouth dropped open in disbelief. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Oillpuee</span><span> has been entirely taken by the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>? Lance lost all ten properties in </span><span>Oillpuee</span><span> and retreated to </span><span>Rihilleo</span><span>? He lost three Class AA members and over a dozen Class A members? And even Lance himself got injured?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rapid-fire updates left Osborne stunned. He hadn't expected the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' offensive to be this fierce right after starting the war.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lance wasn't weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had support from branches in </span><span>Yalynch</span><span>, Marcelin, and Ransford branch bloodlines, plus four Elders from the main bloodline backing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lance's power was definitely no weaker than that of Osborne. In fact, it was significantly stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Osborne only had two main bloodlines elders and the instructors and trainees from Training Base No. 6 to rely on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb and Janet, both Class AAA, were his main support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides them, Osborne had just three Class AA instructors, seven Class A+ instructors, and ten Class A trainees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Lance lost three Class AA and over a dozen Class A members within just a few hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face turned grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly checked the rankings on the Draco Star Wristlet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lance's score had already dropped below negative three thousand. This meant he had lost all ten of </span><span>Oillpuee's</span><span> properties and had only managed to take out a few enemies in return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Osborne sucked in a breath. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just him. Caleb and Janet looked equally concerned. They hadn't anticipated such a powerful assault from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was unstoppable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what are you planning to do?" Caleb asked with a tense expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought quickly, "</span><span>Oillpuee</span><span> is just west of </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, in neighboring provinces. Thank goodness, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> chose to attack </span><span>Oillpuee</span><span> first, rather than </span><span>Dampston</span><span>. If they had hit </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, the properties I am responsible for might have already fallen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Osborne couldn't afford to relax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Since the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> has taken </span><span>Oillpuee</span><span>, they won't stop there. Their assault on </span><span>Dampston</span><span> could start any moment now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne asked urgently, "Mr. Caleb Augustine, which properties in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> do I need to defend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dampston</span><span> also had ten properties that needed defending. However, due to Owen, Osborne wasn't handling them alone. He was sharing the responsibility with Owen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was responsible for half of those ten properties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb replied quickly, "You're in charge of the Draco Group's </span><span>Dampston</span><span> headquarters, two rare metal mines, and two regular properties. Their scores are one thousand, five hundred, and one hundred respectively."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mind raced. "</span><span>So</span><span> if </span><span>Dampston</span><span> is also taken by the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, I'll lose two thousand two hundred points? Owen will only lose nine hundred?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb nodded. "</span><span>Dampston</span><span> is your priority. </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> will be the fallback."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what's your next move? We don't have the strength to defend other places. The only option is to focus all our efforts on defending the </span><span>Dampston</span><span> headquarters." Caleb suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne calmly shook his head. "No, let them have everything. Send out my orders immediately for everyone at the Draco Group's </span><span>Dampston</span><span> headquarters and the two rare metal mines. Tell everyone to evacuate right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb was taken aback. "You want to abandon the defense? Even the </span><span>Dampston</span><span> headquarters? That's a thousand points."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head. "Points are only worth it if you can keep them. If you can't defend, you're just wasting lives. Follow my orders. All properties under my defense, whether in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> or </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>, must cease operations immediately. Everyone should evacuate to Campbell or Yevette. They must not return without my command."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb frowned but eventually nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood that Osborne was trying to trade space for time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If all properties in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> and </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> were abandoned, Osborne's score would </span><span>likely end up even lower than Lance's, potentially ending up at the bottom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned to Isaac. His expression was grim. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isaac, make sure everyone from the Augustine family branch in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> evacuates too. Also, notify the Radcliffe family in </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> to leave immediately. Whether they heed the warning is up to them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne contacted Austin directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin was quick to act, arranging for the Montague family to start their withdrawal without asking for reasons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are we going to retreat?" Caleb asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought for a moment. "Mr. Caleb Augustine, please lead everyone to retreat to the Draco Group headquarters in Campbell first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you?" Caleb noticed Osborne's implication and asked in surprise, "Are you staying here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded gravely. "I can't leave yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why not?" Caleb was even more surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head, not explaining.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't tell Caleb that Clarissa was in a nearby safe house, in the crucial stages of breaking through to Class A. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was worried about Clarissa and couldn't afford to leave. If the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> found her hiding place, she would be in grave danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed to wait until Clarissa's breakthrough was complete. Additionally, staying behind would give him a chance to eliminate more </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his spatial and dark power, he could cause significant trouble for the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> if he acted as an assassin.</span></p><div class="pagination">
