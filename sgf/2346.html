  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha thought, "Am I going to die? Maybe it's a good thing that my Dark Phoenix Bloodline hasn't awakened. At least, the elders of the Ember Phoenix Clan won't die because of me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She bit her lower lip, </span><span>a pang of regret washing over her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But soon, she shook her head. What these people trying to kill her truly wanted to destroy was the hope of the entire Ember Phoenix Clan. Even if she hadn't awakened the Dark Phoenix Bloodline, as long as the Ember Phoenix Clan grew slightly stronger, they would still be suppressed by them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her appearance merely brought these people out earlier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha's eyes were filled with unwillingness. She thought, "It's a pity I'm too weak. If I were strong enough, I would definitely kill these people."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had never craved power as much as she did at this moment. But power doesn't appear out of thin air; she was merely a weakling who wasn't even an Empyrean Sacredness. In a battle of warriors at this level, she could do nothing, not even resist, and could only wait silently for death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Take the Dark Phoenix and leave." Suddenly, Zebulon roared, "The Dark Phoenix is not only the hope of the Ember Phoenix Clan on the Racial Convergence Planet but also the hope of the Ember Phoenix Clan in the cosmos. She absolutely cannot die. Otherwise, I won't be able to face the ancestors of the Ember Phoenix Clan."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll hold them off. Take the Dark Phoenix and leave immediately."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Zebulon's body began to swell, flames and light bursting out from within him. At this moment, a terrifying energy locked onto the ten top-tier warriors wearing black masks at the level of Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone shouted, "Mr. Hiram."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another person shouted angrily, "Mr. Hiram, don't!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Zebulon's current state, the elders of the Ember Phoenix Clan immediately had reddened eyes, as Zebulon was self-destructing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Hiram!" Agatha's eyes also turned red.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a top-tier warrior at the level of Empyrean Sacredness, Zebulon was one of the strongest warriors on Racial Convergence Planet. He was respected, held immense power, and possessed an incredibly long lifespan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But to save her, he was willing to self-destruct.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He used self-destruction to block those ten top warriors, just to give her a sliver of hope to survive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha felt a lump in her throat. She stared at the ten enemies with hatred in her eyes, but tears still fell.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go now. I can die, but Dark Phoenix cannot. Take her away immediately. If she dies because of us, we will all be sinners of the Ember Phoenix Clan. Go!" Zebulon roared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The elders of the Ember Phoenix Clan were now fewer than twenty. Their eyes were bloodshot, still ready to fight to the death. But hearing Zebulon's roar, they clenched their teeth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go!" An elder of the Ember Phoenix Clan quickly grabbed Agatha and fled into the distance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other elders surrounded her protectively.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You want to leave? Do you think you can escape? Since the Ember Phoenix Clan is so foolish, not only will Dark Phoenix die, but all of you will too." The warriors in black masks immediately launched a pursuit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"All of you, come back! Phoenix Shackle!" Zebulon shouted angrily. A flaming chain suddenly emerged from within him, swiftly linking together and sealing off the entire area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The warriors' attacks struck it, but they were all repelled and unable to break through.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You think this can stop us? How ridiculous. Break it!" the leading warrior sneered. Immediately, an even more terrifying power emanated from him, and the burning chains shattered instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that moment, Zebulon's body suddenly exploded. "Let's go to hell together."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The terrifying force of the self-detonation instantly swept out, engulfing all ten black-masked warriors. The overwhelming power nearly evaporated the entire Moon Sea, causing the whole Zephyr State to tremble violently, with mountains collapsing and rivers reversing their flow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The self-destruction of a top warrior at the Empyrean Sacredness level was truly terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All ten black-masked warriors coughed up blood. Worried that using the Sacred Artifact would reveal their identities, they could only rely on Sacred Power for defense. However, the self-detonation was too terrifying; even with their combined efforts, they were still injured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, they were only injured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zebulon's self-detonation made them even angrier. After suppressing the explosion's power, they looked in the direction Agatha had fled, radiating killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of them said, "Do you think you can escape like this? You're dreaming. And do you think stalling for time will bring support from the Ember Phoenix Clan deeper in the universe? That's ridiculous."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Ember Phoenix Clan deeper in the universe has others to hold them off. We have enough time to find the Dark Phoenix and completely kill her. Let's go after her quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The ten black-masked warriors swiftly chased in the direction Agatha fled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Agatha spat out another mouthful of blood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry about me anymore. I can't hold on any longer. If you keep taking me with you, you'll be caught and killed too. I don't want you to die because of me," Agatha said, her eyes filled with tears.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To save her, Zebulon self-destructed. At this moment, only Vice Chief Finley Dempsey and twenty elders remained by her side. These were the last warriors of the Ember Phoenix Clan on the Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they also died, the Ember Phoenix Clan on the Racial Convergence Planet would be extinct.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha did not want such a thing to happen.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Agatha, shut up. You are the Dark Phoenix, which makes you the hope of the Ember Phoenix Clan. The Ember Phoenix Clan will never abandon you. Besides, Mr. Hiram has already sacrificed himself to save you. How can you think of dying? Would this be fair to Mr. Hiram? Would this be fair to the clan members of the Ember Phoenix Clan who died for you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You not only can't die, but you also need to grow stronger quickly, avenge Mr. Hiram, avenge the clan members. You must take all of them down."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You must live well," Finley said through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, his expression suddenly changed. "No, they're catching up again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finley glanced around at the situation, feeling utterly hopeless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Now, only I, a top-tier warrior at Empyrean Sacredness, and twenty elders of the Ember Phoenix Clan are left. There's no way we can withstand those ten warriors with black masks."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Once we're caught, we'll all die, and Agatha will too. Then..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Finley made up his mind and quickly said to Agatha, "Agatha, the elders and I will hold off the enemy. But we won't last long. After that, it's up to you. Soon, I'll open a dimensional portal to send you into deep space."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Deep space is extremely complex. If you're lucky, you might survive. Remember, you are the Dark Phoenix, the hope of the Ember Phoenix Clan. No matter what happens, you must never give up easily."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You must survive and quickly grow stronger. Only then will you be worthy of the Ember Phoenix Clan members sacrificing themselves for you. You must live on."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Finley waved his hand. Instantly, he tore open a massive spatial rift, like the gaping maw of a giant beast, capable of devouring everything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get in quickly." Finley forcefully threw Agatha inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No! Don't!" Agatha shouted. But she couldn't stop anything and could only disappear into the dimensional portal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Finley revealed a pained smile. "This is all we can do. This is both the calamity and the hope of our Ember Phoenix Clan. Next, let's use our lives to make those ten bastards pay a price."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, flames and light erupted from their bodies, and they turned to charge at the ten warriors wearing black masks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were going to self-destruct together.</span></p><div class="pagination">
