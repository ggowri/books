  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was completely stunned by Adriana's words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his view, Adriana's actions seemed a bit crazy. Just for a junior who wasn't even an Empyrean Sacredness, she was willing to oppose the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one would be this crazy!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least Osborne felt that his relationship with Adriana wasn't that close. Would Adriana really be willing to risk the entire Fairy Moon Sect just because she believed in him and go crazy with him?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That's impossible!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath to calm himself and asked, "Ms. Alba, may I know the real reason?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana heard this and immediately laughed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You little guy, why are you so sharp? As expected, nothing can fool you! Alright, I admit that believing in you is only part of the reason. Another part is because of Isa, Clarissa, and the others..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Isa and Clarissa's talents exceeded my expectations. They will definitely become the pillars of the Fairy Moon Sect in the future! Even if I leave the Fairy Moon Sect, they will quickly be able to support it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With your relationship with them... if you ever clash with the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, no matter what, they will definitely get involved and come to help you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can't possibly restrain them! Doing so would only make them hate me... So, unless I drive them all out of the Fairy Moon Sect, sooner or later, there will be a conflict with the Glorious Divine Kingdom Royal Family."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana's expression turned cold. "The reasons I mentioned earlier are not the most crucial ones! The real reason is... even without you, the Fairy Moon Sect would still have to clash with the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was utterly astonished upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why? The Fairy Moon Sect is doing fine now, so why would it clash with the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana said calmly, "Because the Royal Family won't let me live! They won't let the Fairy Moon Sect survive either! To the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, the Fairy Moon Sect is simply too powerful! And the Fairy Moon Sect's goal has always been to become the fourth top-tier power on the Racial Convergence Planet!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But the Glorious Divine Kingdom won't allow such a thing to happen! After all, another top-tier power would take away a portion of the Glorious Divine Kingdom's interests!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, not long after the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel ended, Emperor Frederick approached me and gave me an ultimatum! Either I marry Emperor Frederick, bear his children, and make the Fairy Moon Sect a subordinate force of the Royal Family. Or..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Glorious Divine Kingdom Royal Family will take action against the Fairy Moon Sect!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, Adriana's face turned extremely grim. "Emperor Frederick, he is a ruthless man! In his eyes, there is only power and a higher cultivation level! How could I marry him? How could I bear his children? And the Fairy Moon Sect... it could never become a vassal of the Royal Family!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, I can never agree!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although he said that as long as I agreed, he would reveal the secret of Necropolis City to me, a way to quickly break through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness like him! He tried to tempt me, but I still refused him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The conflict between the Fairy Moon Sect and the Royal Family is now inevitable! And Emperor Frederick's deadline for me... is right after coming out of Necropolis City!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, if I still refuse to marry him, bear his children, and make the Fairy Moon Sect a vassal of the Royal Family... he will personally destroy the Fairy Moon Sect!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana's eyes were filled with anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, we have a common enemy, don't we? Although you're still weak now and can't change much, I believe in your future!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Emperor Frederick... it's not that easy for him to destroy my Fairy Moon Sect. Relying on the defensive formation of the Fairy Moon Sect, I'm confident I can lead the sect to hold out long enough, long enough for you to grow stronger..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, the situation will turn around!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Adriana looked at Osborne. "This is the real reason I invited you to join the Fairy Moon Sect! You want to deal with the Royal Family, and I want to stop the Royal Family from destroying the Fairy Moon Sect. We can join forces!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stared blankly at Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The news Adriana told him was truly shocking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick forcing Adriana to marry him? To have his children? Even making the Fairy Moon Sect a vassal of the Royal Family? And the final deadline is right after leaving Necropolis City?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No wonder Adriana is unwilling!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No wonder Adriana suddenly doesn't care about offending the Royal Family...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick is threatening Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Knowing Adriana, Osborne is sure she'd rather die than agree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne lowered his head in thought.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How about it? Join the Fairy Moon Sect, and let's take on the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom together! I'm strong enough&mdash;though my current strength may still fall short of Emperor Frederick, and the Fairy Moon Sect's power is far from matching the Royal Family! But at least with me around, they won't crush us so easily!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With me here, I can protect you and stop the Royal Family from killing you so easily!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But you have a future..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Become an honorary Elder of the Fairy Moon Sect, and how about we overthrow the Glorious Divine Kingdom Royal Family together?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana smiled and tempted Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a wry smile, "Ms. Alba, you overestimate me, but... I admit you've convinced me! So, thank you for your fourth invitation. This time, I won't refuse."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, a sharp gleam flashed in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the past, he was unwilling to join the Fairy Moon Sect because he truly didn&rsquo;t want to drag them down. The Fairy Moon Sect was thriving, and there was no need for them to be implicated by him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, the Fairy Moon Sect had already caught the Royal Family's attention.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the latest, by the time they emerged from Necropolis City, Frederick would use the Royal Family's power against the Fairy Moon Sect, possibly even wiping it off the Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And within the Fairy Moon Sect, there were still Isa, Clarissa, Anastasia, and others!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if Osborne didn&rsquo;t join the Fairy Moon Sect, he couldn&rsquo;t just stand by and watch it be destroyed. By then, he would definitely step in to help the Fairy Moon Sect and save Isa, Clarissa, and the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And also, Adriana and Angela!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since that's the case, he might as well join the Fairy Moon Sect directly. At least by joining, he would have allies, and even if he encountered someone he couldn't handle, Adriana could help him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Adriana's strength...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the entire Royal Family, aside from Frederick, no one is her match.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Good!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana smiled when she heard Osborne agree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"From now on, you are the Honorary Elder of the Fairy Moon Sect! This is the Honorary Elder token, which proves your identity!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In the Fairy Moon Sect, your status is second only to me and the two vice palace masters!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana took out a token.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The token emitted an incredibly powerful force, instantly stunning Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this the Supreme Sacred Artifact?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana smiled faintly, "That's right! It's called the Star Token! There are only five of these tokens in total! One is with me, two are with the vice palace masters, and the remaining one, I have already given to Isa!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Five Star Tokens, all Supreme Sacred Artifacts! In critical moments, they can unleash a defense, block a fatal attack for you, and take you to a safe place!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides that, those who possess a Star Token can call for help from others with a Star Token when in danger! Others can quickly teleport over to assist through the Star Token..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Adriana finished speaking, Osborne's eyes lit up even more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is a good thing!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The value of this Star Token is higher than most Supreme Sacred Artifacts!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
