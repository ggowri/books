  <div class="container"><p style="text-align:left;">Wade stared at Osborne and threatened him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne&#x27;s face turned cold in an instant.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He cursed, &quot;Who do you think you are? You dare to threaten me. Clarissa is mine. I&#x27;ll kill anyone who dares to covet her!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Wade burst into laughter. &quot;You are so arrogant! Since you said so, I will declare the news as the eldest master of the Paltrow family.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Alexander and Clarissa will hold their wedding in twenty days! At that time, he will officially become the new head of the Paltrow family. We welcome everyone to attend the wedding.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Osborne, I hope you can come by then. But do you dare to come?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne narrowed his eyes when he heard this.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Twenty days?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Twenty days later, Alexander would have probably suppressed the unstable power after the breakthrough and had also absorbed the remaining power of the Blessing of Thunder.</p><p style="text-align:left;">At that time, his strength would reach its peak.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Twenty days later, Alexander would hold a wedding with Clarissa, and at the same time, he would become the head of the Paltrow family.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne clenched his fists and felt the pressure.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Could he stop it?</p><p style="text-align:left;">How could he stop it?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Wade continued, &quot;Why are you silent? Weren&#x27;t you very arrogant just now? And you said you will kill anyone who dares to covet Clarissa. Alexander will marry her in twenty days. What can you do?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Except for bragging, what else can you do?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Wade had a disdainful look.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne snorted coldly, &quot;Twenty days later, right? Okay, I&#x27;ll remember that. On that day, I&#x27;ll be there.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;By then, whether it will be Alexander&#x27;s wedding or funeral, just wait and see!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Wade&#x27;s expression changed. &quot;You are courting death!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He activated his power.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Isaac frowned and quickly stood in front of Osborne, staring at Wade vigilantly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne, however, signaled Isaac not to worry. He looked at Wade with disdain and said, &quot;What? Are you scared? Are you worried that I will kill Alexander? So you want to take action and get rid of me in advance, huh?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Well, just do it!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne looked indifferent, and he made up his mind. As long as Wade dared to take action, he would cooperate with Isaac and kill Wade. Even if he had to expose all his power, he had to kill Wade today.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If this happened, the Augustine family would ultimately break up with the Paltrow family.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But the Augustine family was not doomed to lose.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The Paltrow family only had two Class A Power Masters. Alexander&#x27;s power was unstable, and he could not take action for the time being. If Wade had been killed, there would only be two Class A martial masters left. Then, the Augustine family would have a chance to win.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But the premise was that no other forces intervened.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne was not sure.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Unfortunately, Wade did not take action. He just said coldly, &quot;You are really arrogant! The Augustine family will perish early because of you. Remember this!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Let&#x27;s wait and see!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Twenty days later, I will be waiting for you at the Paltrow Estate!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">After saying that, Wade waved his hand, carried the fainted Alexander in his arms, and turned to leave.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne wanted to take action but finally gave up.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Some people from the Walker and Marion families were still around, especially Shawn, who was a Class A Power Master. The Walker family had already joined hands with the Paltrow family. If Osborne joined forces with Isaac to attack Wade, Shawn would definitely intervene.</p><p style="text-align:left;">By then, Osborne would suffer a loss.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He thought, &quot;Forget it. Let Wade go this time. I will kill him one day!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The people from the Paltrow family left, and the onlookers gradually left. Shawn glanced at Osborne meaningfully before leaving.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The news that Osborne and Alexander confronted each other and bet their lives spread quickly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne became well-known among the nine ancient families in Dampston because he won the bet.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Although everyone thought that Osborne&#x27;s victory was simply due to luck, he did win. Facing two Class A Power Masters, Alexander and Wade, Osborne was not afraid at all. Instead, he provoked them several times and remained safe and sound.</p><p style="text-align:left;">These things were enough to make him famous in Dampston.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Even Clarissa, who had not left home, got the news.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She murmured, &quot;Osborne...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Clarissa bit her lower lip. She seemed to have lost a lot of weight, but she was still so beautiful and perfect, and her eyes were full of deep longing for Osborne.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Donna sighed, &quot;No one has expected that the boy who came to the manor to apply for a bodyguard position would grow to this point in just over a month. Not only did he become the heir of the ancient Augustine family, but he was not afraid or backed down when confronting the Paltrow family!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Clarissa, you are really good at choosing a man.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Clarissa did not look happy after Donna finished speaking.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Even though Osborne caused such a big fuss and had reached such a height, the elders of the Radcliffe family still felt that Alexander was better.</p><p style="text-align:left;">They thought Osborne defeated Alexander simply because of good luck.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne and Alexander were both the heirs of ancient families, but the Paltrow family was far more powerful than the Augustine family.</p><p style="text-align:left;">What was more, the Paltrow family had already announced the date of the wedding, and the Radcliffe family could no longer change it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Clarissa, do you think Osborne will really go to the Paltrow Estate on the wedding day? He won&#x27;t cause a scene at the wedding and take you away, right?&quot; Donna said worriedly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Clarissa bit her lower lip and said, &quot;Aunt Donna, Osborne will definitely go. I know him very well. No matter how dangerous there is, he will definitely go!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I believe him. He promised me that he would bear it with me!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;He&#x27;ll take me away!&quot;</p><div class="pagination">
