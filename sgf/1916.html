  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're going to pay for this! You're dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph roared in a frenzy, completely blindsided by Osborne's audacity to obliterate his original Soul Current Ocean, effectively severing his escape route.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph mused, "What the hell is Bertram thinking?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was tasked with protecting my original form, and yet he let it come under attack, allowing my Soul Current Ocean to be destroyed! When I get back, he's going to regret this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his mind racing, Adolph launched into a relentless assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no way out, his only glimmer of hope lay in annihilating Osborne's soul and seizing control of Osborne's body and Soul Current Ocean. He had to take Osborne's place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a risky gamble; if his soul power couldn't merge with Osborne's body, he'd be in real trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this was his last option.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to go all in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him! Just kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph's fury fueled his attacks as he desperately aimed to wipe out Osborne's soul power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only he knew about the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity backing Osborne, he might have felt a sense of despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But alas, Adolph was blissfully unaware.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, on the other hand, wasn't about to let him in on that little secret. He continued to control his soul power, battling against Adolph's relentless onslaught. Though he still struggled against Adolph, his growing insight into soul power was becoming evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was mastering it more and more, making it increasingly difficult for Adolph to shatter his defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in East Zone's Wild Flame City, Bertram Eldridge, an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King, finally noticed something was off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could see Adolph's life force rapidly dwindling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the destruction of his Soul Current Ocean, Adolph's body was effectively dead, and his vitality was fading fast. The realization sent shockwaves through Bertram.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh no!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertram rushed to Adolph's side, pressing his hand against Adolph's forehead to assess the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he saw left him in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others from the Paramount Supreme Clan began to notice Adolph's condition, their faces painted with astonishment and confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them finally asked, breaking the tense silence, "Mr. Bertram Eldridge, what's wrong with Mr. Adolph Eldridge?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertram's face darkened, and his teeth clenched. "Adolph's Soul Current Ocean has been destroyed! He... he's dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is that even possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Adolph Eldridge's Soul Current Ocean is destroyed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shock rippled through the Paramount Supreme Clan members, disbelief etched across their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph was an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King, a master of soul power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could someone have destroyed his Soul Current Ocean? And they were completely in the dark about it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic set in as they exchanged worried glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertram remained silent, knowing full well that this disaster was entirely his fault. Adolph had entrusted him with the task of safeguarding Adolph's original form, but his negligence had given Osborne the opening he needed to infiltrate Adolph's Soul Current Ocean and self-destruct.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But one question gnawed at him. "Adolph has detached his soul power to confront Theodore, so how could Theodore still pose a threat to Adolph's original form? What is the state of Adolph's soul power now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bertram's expression darkened as he murmured to himself, "All I can do now is hope that Adolph's soul power finds a body to merge with. If that happens, he might still have a chance at survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ideally, Adolph'd take down Theodore and seize his body! With Theodore's talent and potential, if Adolph could really take over, it might turn out to be a blessing in disguise!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He could inherit Theodore's gifts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Adolph was indeed doing just that. But with every strike he launched, Osborne's soul power seemed to absorb the blows only to regenerate and grow stronger. Despair was creeping in on Adolph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His soul power was depleting at an alarming rate!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In stark contrast, Osborne's soul power remained unscathed, becoming even more formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph yelled, "No! This can't be happening! I don't believe it! How can your soul power regenerate so quickly? Doesn't it have any limits?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of monster are you?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled coldly in response. "Adolph, I told you your time is up! Your Divine Ascendance Technique&mdash;Soul Spark Oblivion&mdash;was impressive, igniting my Soul Current Ocean using just a fragment of my Spatial Clone's soul power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But guess what? It's not enough to kill me! The dumbest thing you did was detach your soul power and come into my Soul Current Ocean to fight me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your soul power will be snuffed out here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each passing moment, Osborne grew more relaxed. Adolph's soul power was nearly spent, and now, Osborne's was strong enough to overpower him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next step was to utterly crush Adolph's soul power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adolph shouted, "No! This can't be! I can't lose!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King who specializes in soul power! How could I ever be defeated by you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if it costs me my life, I won't let you escape unscathed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You destroyed my Soul Current Ocean, and I'll take yours down with me! Self-destruct!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
