  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that instant, even though Tristram and his team were trapped in the Eclipse Realm and had lost all their senses, they felt an icy chill run down their spines as danger loomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh no! He's trying to kill us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They shouted in panic, darting around frantically in an attempt to evade the impending doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But it was all in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Countless Abyssal Spears surged toward them in a heartbeat, and they had no way to sense or dodge the lethal projectiles. All they could do was brace for impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When the Abyssal Spears struck, they detonated against the divine power shields surrounding Tristram and his companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite their desperate efforts to defend themselves, the onslaught was relentless, and their divine power defenses shattered in an instant. Next came the Supreme Malevolence Shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While the Supreme Malevolence Shield boasted impressive protection, it paled in comparison to the Supreme Sovereign's Armor. It was no match for Osborne's Abyssal Spears, which quickly pierced through the shield and then their Divine Bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A chilling scream echoed within the Eclipse Realm, the final cries of Tristram and his team as they faced their grim fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, the darkness of the Eclipse Realm swallowed their screams, preventing them from reaching the outside world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Tristram's group was like a beehive under attack, their Divine Bodies riddled with Abyssal Spears, their lives flickering away at an alarming rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unless they possessed something akin to Osborne's immortality, there would be no trace of them left in this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a final thud, their broken bodies collapsed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne waved his hand, collecting their Supreme Malevolence Sword and Supreme Malevolence Shield, casually handing them over to Anastasia and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, everyone in his group possessed both the Supreme Malevolence Sword and Shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But that wasn't enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's gaze shifted toward Caesar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caesar found himself ensnared in the Eclipse Realm as well, but unlike Tristram's team, he didn't panic. With the Supreme Sovereign's Armor shielding him, he felt secure despite the loss of his senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead, Caesar was struck by sheer astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is&mdash;Eclipse Realm! Who the hell is he? How can he comprehend the Eclipse Realm? Even among the Paramount Supreme Clan's Five Brilliant Scions, only Egbert Eldridge at the top has mastered this realm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Who is he? A lowly member of the Human Community, and yet he has grasped the Eclipse Realm?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No way! I need to get out of here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>My Supreme Sovereign's Armor is powerful, but I can't risk him having some trick up his sleeve that could bypass its defenses! The strength of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings has exceeded my expectations, especially Theodore&mdash;their leader. He's just as formidable as Egbert!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I must escape the Eclipse Realm and rally the Paramount Supreme Clan's strongest warriors to eliminate the Seven Young Deity Kings once and for all! Who cares about this ridiculous arena challenge? I just want them dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Seven Young Deity Kings of the Human Community must perish today! They cannot escape!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they do, they might grow into threats like the Seven Great Deity Kings, and that would spell disaster for us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caesar's mind raced, but he remained calm, refusing to panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though Caesar had never fully comprehended the Eclipse Realm, he had witnessed its effects before. He understood that within this realm, losing one's senses and sense of direction meant that no amount of frantic movement would lead to escape. The only way out was to focus and sense the path to freedom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Found it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A spark of realization lit up Caesar's eyes as he discovered a way to exit the Eclipse Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Joy surged through him as he prepared to make his escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank goodness I possess dark power! My cultivation level is higher than his, which is why I can find the way out! Once I'm free, I'll rally everyone from the Paramount Supreme Clan to take down those damn Seven Young Deity Kings from the Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With determination, Caesar surged toward the exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wait a minute! You actually cracked my Eclipse Realm? Trying to leave, are we?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's surprise was palpable as he noticed Caesar's movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he dismissed any concern with a sneer. "So what if you figured it out? You're not going anywhere!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a flick of his thoughts, seven Spatial Clones appeared, blocking Caesar's path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Osborne's voice echoed in Caesar's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Caesar, you're not leaving today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caesar's expression hardened, and he scoffed, saying, "Theodore! You can't stop me! I've already broken your Eclipse Realm. I have the Supreme Sovereign's Armor, and you won't breach my defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't even think about holding me back! Once I'm out, you're all dead! Sure, you can claim victory in this arena battle, but what does that matter?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You'll die here today! My Paramount Supreme Clan has elders at the peak of Deity King level present, along with numerous Deity King powerhouses. Once they strike, you're finished!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And let's not forget, there are plenty of Deity King warriors from other clans at my command. They'll swarm you, and no one will escape! Hahaha! Once you're dead, who will care about your little arena victory?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a cold smirk, Caesar finished his taunt.</span></p><div class="pagination">
