  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone said, "Mr. Jethro Hudson, care to explain?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why isn't there a single genius from the Hudson family on the roster?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For the Transcendent Deity matches, no Hudson family members!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not a soul from the Hudson family for the Celestial Deity matches either!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The same goes for the Deity Overlord contests&mdash;still no Hudson family members!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even in the Deity King level competitions, not a single name from the Hudson family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I'm not mistaken, your eldest son Zachary and your eldest daughter Alicia are both super geniuses at the peak of Deity King level, right? If you had submitted their names, they would surely have been selected!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The only explanation for this situation is that you, Mr. Jethro Hudson, didn't submit their names at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Jethro Hudson, isn't that a bit selfish?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd's expressions hardened as they glared at Jethro, anger flickering in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A voice sneered, saying, "Is it possible that the Hudson family, like the Baxter and Faulkner families, has already betrayed the Human Community and allied with Lord Malevolence? Is that why you refuse to lend your strength to the Human Community?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words sent a ripple of shock through the crowd, and they turned to Jethro with even more suspicion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Dark Deity Legion poised to launch a full-scale assault on the West Zone Human Community, the absence of any Hudson family geniuses from the border competition roster raised serious questions. They couldn't think of any other reason for such a glaring oversight&mdash;perhaps the Hudson family had indeed turned their backs on the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's eyes bore into Jethro as they demanded answers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Jethro's face flushed crimson with indignation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're talking nonsense!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We would rather perish than betray the Human Community and side with Lord Malevolence! How dare you question our loyalty? How many of our talents have fallen to the Dark Deity Legion on the battlefield? How many of my kin have fought valiantly for the Human Community, only to lose their lives in the process?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Which of your factions has suffered greater losses than the Hudson family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"None! And yet you dare to imply that we would betray the Human Community?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro's fury boiled over. He could accept Tanner's criticism regarding the lack of Hudson family members in the border competition roster, as it was undeniably true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he could not stand idly by while others accused the Hudson family of treachery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man who had suggested the Hudson family's betrayal scoffed, his disdain palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His name was Julian Cullen, the leader of the HeartUnited Alliance&mdash;a powerful faction within the Human Community, rivaling even the Jackson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the eighteen Dukedom Level Powers, both HeartUnited Alliance and the Jackson family ranked among the top three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian, an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King, fixed Jethro with a cold, contemptuous stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Jethro Hudson, we acknowledge that the Hudson family has suffered significant losses on the border battlefield over the years! But who's to say those losses were genuine?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just like the Baxter and Faulkner families... they lost many warriors, only for it to be revealed later that they had betrayed the Human Community and colluded with the Dark Deity Legion! Those warriors didn't really die; they faked their deaths to escape!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do we know you, the Hudson family, aren't doing the same?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that's not the case, then please explain why there isn't a single Hudson family member on the roster for this border competition!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro's anger surged even higher at Julian's insinuations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth and retorted, "How am I supposed to know why there isn't a single Hudson family member on the border competition roster? I submitted the names of all our talents to the esteemed God of Light, and I can assure you, the number of participants from the Hudson family willing to fight in this competition far exceeds anyone else here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The laughter from Tanner and Julian echoed through the hall, dripping with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others joined in the laughter, their gazes filled with disdain as they looked at Jethro.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian sneered, saying, "Seriously, man, do you think we're stupid? You submitted a list of your so-called Hudson 'geniuses,' yet somehow, not a single one made the cut? Are you saying your family is entirely useless? That the esteemed God of Light overlooked all your 'talent'?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner chimed in with a mocking laugh, "Come on, Jethro, are you still trying to argue? The list you sent over must have been filled with losers. The real Hudson family talents are probably hidden away somewhere, aren't they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro, rage simmering beneath the surface, retorted, "That's not true!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I genuinely submitted the list to the esteemed God of Light! It included not just my son Zachary and daughter Alicia, but all my other children and grandchildren as well!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know how important the border competition is, and the Hudson family is absolutely willing to contribute. I submitted a list with over 20 thousand names!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the esteemed God of Light didn't select them, and I have no idea why!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Jethro finished speaking, the room fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The notion that he had submitted all his descendants, along with twenty thousand other names, was so ridiculous that it left the crowd in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner broke the silence, his tone icy. "Jethro, quit spinning tales! If you really submitted that list, how could the esteemed God of Light overlook every single Hudson family member?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you trying to imply that the esteemed God of Light is absent and you want to shift the blame? Do you think the esteemed God of Light intentionally decided not to send Hudson family members into battle?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that were the case, it might also indicate that she suspects your family has betrayed the Human Community, making her reluctant to enlist any of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these words, laughter filled the room again, and contempt was palpable on the faces of those around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro clenched his fists and said, "I've said it before, and I'll say it again! The Hudson family has never betrayed the Human Community, nor will we ever! As for why there aren't any Hudson names on the list, well, when the esteemed God of Light returns, we'll have clarity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And Julian, if you dare continue to suggest my family has turned traitor, I won't let this go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian looked back at him with all the disdain in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can threaten me? So what if I say the Hudson family is betraying the Human Community? Prove me wrong if you can!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!" Jethro's face turned an even deeper shade of red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a familiar figure emerged above them atop the massive Radiant Throne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the God of Light!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked perplexed at the sight of Jethro, Tanner, and Julian arguing fiercely below, with the crowd casting hostile glares at Jethro. Her brow creased in concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I only stepped away briefly, and you've already descended into chaos. The Dark Deity Legion is pressing in on us, and an all-out war could break out at any moment. Why are you squabbling among yourselves?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As her voice carried across the room, everyone's attention shifted toward her.</span></p><div class="pagination">
