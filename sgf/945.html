  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Osborne was on the brink of being engulfed by the onslaught of attacks, a blinding flash of light shot through the chaos, converging into a terrifying force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The barrage of attacks aimed at Osborne was obliterated by the radiant energy, which surged onward, tearing through the crowd of clones with unstoppable momentum, leaving a trail of devastation in its wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deafening roar erupted from the distance as a fleet of figures emerged, dressed in sleek black combat gear and armed to the teeth with flamboyant energy weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their numbers were staggering&mdash;over five thousand strong, each one radiating an aura of power that marked them as at least Class A+!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the Blood Demons!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five thousand members of the Blood Demon, resembling a well-trained army, charged forward with a terrifying momentum. Their energy weapons blazed as they opened fire, creating an onslaught that left the clones reeling from the sudden wave of destruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among those leading the charge were ten individuals wielding peculiar handguns, their energy bullets erupting with such ferocity that even Class AAA clones stood no </span><span>chance of withstanding the firepower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those were super energy pistols!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The simultaneous appearance of the Blood Demon members heralded a massive shift in the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their energy weapons lit up the area, raining down havoc on the clones and sending them into a state of panicked disarray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a surge of exhilaration as he realized that his allies had finally arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If help hadn't come when it did, he would've been a goner!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to their introduction to the fray, the attacks targeting Osborne diminished significantly, allowing him to steady himself. With a steely gaze, he faced the scattered remnants of the enemy forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen up, Blood Demon members! Annihilate them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charging forward, Osborne watched as the once-confident clones fell into further disarray at the sight of the overwhelming Blood Demon numbers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the average strength of the Blood Demon members might not measure up to the Class AA clones or even the elite Draco Armed Services Branch, their sheer quantity was an overwhelming advantage&mdash;three times that of the clones!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clones were battle-weary and heavily drained from the prolonged fight, while the Blood Demon members were at their peak, bolstered by their energy weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this scenario, the Blood Demons were more than capable of breaking through the remaining enemy forces!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were still over a thousand members of the Draco Armed Services Branch joining the fray!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As their reinforcements surged forth, the tide of battle shifted. Under Serena's guidance, the Draco Armed Services Branch forces broke free from their defensive positions and launched a counteroffensive against the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Ahhh</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the Aberrant clones suffered devastating losses, toppling like dominos under the coordinated fire of the Blood Demon members' energy weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tide of battle turned, and Medusa Queen's expression twisted in alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! How could they get reinforcements? Why are there so many of them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face darkened as she watched the Blood Demon members crash into their lines, obliterating clone after clone. There was nothing but dissatisfaction in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We were so close to taking out Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just a hair's breadth away from wiping out the Draco Armed Services Branch's main force!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Medusa Queen scoffed, flinging her hand decisively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Retreat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that with five thousand peak-state Blood Demon members joining the battle, there was no way they could breach Campbell's headquarters or eliminate Osborne and the Draco Armed Services Branch forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, her priority was to ensure a timely escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they didn't pull back soon, they risked annihilation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Gerardo viewed them merely as expendable pawns, the clones were still a resource they couldn't afford to lose too many of; after all, cloning them consumed a substantial amount of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fall back! Get out of here, now!" Medusa Queen screamed, her voice piercing through the chaos as she glared at Osborne with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I'll let you live for now! But mark my words, when we meet again, I will personally end you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she began to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a scoff. "You think you can waltz in and out whenever you please? Not a chance! After them! Wipe them out! Leave no one standing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rallied the Blood Demon members, and a fierce pursuit began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For eighty miles, they chased, the adrenaline propelling them forward until Osborne finally felt his energy waning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hand, signaling everyone to stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once-mighty throng of two thousand clones had dwindled to fewer than a thousand, and at least half had perished at the hands of Blood Demon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glaring at the ragtag group of clones fleeing in disarray, Osborne felt a chill settle over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! Consider yourselves lucky!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When we meet next, I swear I'll eradicate every last one of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he gestured for the Blood Demon to regroup, and they made their way back to the Campbell headquarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Assess the damage!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne surveyed the wreckage at Campbell HQ, where bodies littered the ground, the thrill of victory evaporated in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wondered, "Though we've won the battle, the cost has been staggering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> will not just sit back and take this defeat; they'll regroup and launch even stronger attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Can we withstand it when the time comes?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
