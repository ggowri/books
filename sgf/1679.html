  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice of Deathborn King thundered like rolling thunder, even reaching Osborne six miles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood frozen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can Deathborn speak?" he murmured, recalling his previous encounters with these creatures, none of whom had ever uttered a word. They seemed to communicate through some unique and silent method.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time he'd heard Deathborn's voice, and it sent a shiver down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will offer your flesh and blood as a sacrifice to </span><span>our</span><span> great </span><span>Master!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "</span><span>Who was this</span><span> Master?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Do all the Deathborns serve </span><span>one master</span><span>? They slaughter all living beings and</span><span> devour</span><span> their flesh</span><span> to offer sacrifices to their Master?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And why did he </span><span>call us</span><span> as '</span><span>evil </span><span>outsiders'?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mind raced with questions, and his expression was mixed of confusion and intrigue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Angelo </span><span>frowned</span><span> and spoke up. "Deathborn King, we stumbled into your territory by accident</span><span>! </span><span>We mean you no harm. If you let us go, we'll leave peacefully."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deathborn King sneered at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You invade</span><span>d</span><span> my realm</span><span> and </span><span>kill</span><span>ed </span><span>my subjects</span><span>! N</span><span>ow do you think you can just </span><span>leave</span><span>? You </span><span>evil </span><span>outsiders deserve to die! You will all be offerings for my </span><span>Master!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, </span><span>go to hell</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Deathborn King unleashed a wave of terrifying power toward Angelo and his group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo scoffed, saying, "Do you really think I'm </span><span>scared</span><span> of you? If you want to kill us, </span><span>bring it on</span><span>! Try </span><span>m</span><span>e!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Angelo retaliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fierce battle erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo held nothing back, unleashing his full strength, and his mind control power surged like a tidal wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew they had to eliminate Deathborn King quickly if they wanted any chance of survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Deathborn army arrived, escaping would be nothing but a dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edison and the others understood the dire situation and joined the fray, but their attacks barely grazed Deathborn King, serving only to help Angelo fend off the surrounding patrols.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clash of Deity Kings was intense and terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched, captivated, as the two Deity King</span><span>s</span><span> </span><span>fought with each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt the energy radiating from both fighters and compared it to his own strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but think, "They're strong, but not</span><span> that</span><span> overwhelmingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seems like they're not much stronger than me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm not saying </span><span>they're weak. It's that I've grown stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having broken through to the early stages of Deity Overlord, with both my space and dark elemental essences hitting Level Seven and boasting a Level Nine Divine Body, I may still be a quasi-Deity King, but the gap between me and a regular Deity King is practically non-existent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could probably take on a Deity King myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excitement surged through Osborne at the thought, sparking a desire to jump into the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he soon received word from his clone that the Deathborn army was gathering within the kingdom and rapidly advancing toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The numbers exceeded 30 thousand and were only increasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Angelo and Deathborn King</span><span> are about equally matched in strength. </span><span>There's no way Angelo can take him down in a short time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than ten minutes, the Deathborn army will be here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, Angelo won't stand a chance against the King. Even if he survives, he'll be gravely injured. And that's not </span><span>what</span><span> I </span><span>want!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Deathborn King must die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then can I obtain the death scent liquid to fully restore the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity</span><span>!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As these thoughts raced through Osborne's mind, he made a decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to help Angelo. Together, they would take down Deathborn King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, stay here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes widened in alarm. "Osborne, what </span><span>are you trying to do</span><span>? We just need to do nothing</span><span>!</span><span> Angelo and </span><span>his guys</span><span> are dead meat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head, and his expression was resolute. "Whether Angelo lives or dies doesn't matter to me! But for some specific reason, Deathborn King must die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right now, Angelo can't take him down alone. I need to step in and help him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's worry deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you going to </span><span>fight the </span><span>Deathborn King? He's a Deity King!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, a glint of determination in his eyes. "Exactly! It's the perfect time to test just how far I've come compared to a Deity King! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Any</span><span>way, I need to </span><span>do it</span><span>.</span><span> Take care of yourself!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne's features began to shift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon</span><span>, </span><span>his look had</span><span> a striking resemblance to the Tobey he had </span><span>dealt with</span><span> earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gripping the Supreme Malevolence Sword, Osborne felt an invigorating surge of power coursing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sword's sharp energy amplified his strength, making him feel invincible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait for me here!" he shouted,</span><span> </span><span>dashing </span><span>out.</span></p><div class="pagination">
