  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne to win, odds at 100 to 1!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a throng of people gathered around the betting tables, placing their wagers on their favorite contenders for the top twenty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only could they bet on who would ultimately take the crown, but they could also wager on the top three, top five, top ten, and even on individual matchups. The betting scene was impressively professional.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The higher-ups of Mystic Sirius Sect turned a blind eye to this activity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, the higher-ups of the Mystic Sirius Sect were pulling the strings behind these wagers. Rumor had it that it was none other than Lenny, the sect master, who'd set the whole betting scheme in motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Numerous Elders from Mystic Sirius Sect also participated, placing their bets. Winning would show off their keen judgment, and even if they lost, it was just a few Celestial Crystals&mdash;nothing to worry about for those of Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, some wealthy individuals even used Sacred Crystals for their bets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I bet on Vadim for the championship&mdash;one hundred Sacred Crystals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold, confident voice rang out, and suddenly, one hundred </span><span>Sacred</span><span> Crystals appeared on the betting table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd went silent, all eyes turning toward the person who had just placed the bet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For most people present, one hundred Sacred Crystals represented a significant resource&mdash;far too much to risk on a bet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of losing such an amount was enough to make anyone cringe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when they recognized the better, understanding dawned on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was none other than Vadim himself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With confidence gleaming in his eyes, Vadim remarked casually, "I can place a bet on myself to win, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure thing!" The attendant quickly took Vadim's bet and handed him a receipt with a beaming smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here's hoping you strike it lucky, Vadim! May you grab that championship!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vadim flashed a subtle smile and sized up the crowd. Then he continued, "Don't you fret. The championship's as good as mine! No one's </span><span>gonna</span><span> wrest it from me! If you </span><span>wanna</span><span> rake in some resources from this bet, you'd better put your money on me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A collective gasp swept through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, Vadim's got some serious swagger! He must have some ace up his sleeve!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vadim's the sect leader's nephew! With someone like that in his corner, how could he not win? If Vadim doesn't take the crown, who could?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm betting five thousand Celestial Crystals on Vadim to win!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll chuck in ten thousand Celestial Crystals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm throwing in thirty thousand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll bet five Sacred Crystals just to back Vadim!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, bets came pouring in for Vadim to win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Vadim broke into a wide grin, oozing self-assurance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! Vadim, you're getting a bit too cocky! Just keep in mind that while you're hyping everyone up to bet on you, don't lead them down the drain! The championship's </span><span>gonna</span><span> be mine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm betting one hundred Sacred Crystals on Jamar to win!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden outburst sliced through the crowd. It hushed everyone for a moment before setting off a fresh flurry of whispers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Jamar!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seems like Jamar's feeling pretty sure of himself too! He's betting on himself to take the title! In the last Sect Tournament, Jamar went toe-to-toe with Vadim for a whole hour, and it was only the Elders who declared Vadim the winner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jamar wasn't too thrilled about that result. He's surely gunning for revenge this year!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm putting five hundred Celestial Crystals on Jamar to win!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only five hundred? That's all you've got? Don't you have faith in Jamar? Beat it! I'm betting ten thousand Celestial Crystals. This time, Jamar's </span><span>gonna</span><span> show what he's made of!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm betting thirty thousand Celestial Crystals on Jamar!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this time, Vadim squinted his eyes and stared intently at Jamar, his eyes ablaze with fierce determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar locked eyes with Vadim, not showing an ounce of backing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tension between them was thick in the air, like a powder keg ready to go off at any second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But both men stood their ground and chose to hold their horses&mdash;for the time being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Bethan made her grand entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly sized up the two rivals, then strode confidently up to the betting table and tossed down a hundred Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A hundred Sacred Crystals on Bethan to win!" she declared icily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After getting her receipt, she gave Jamar and Vadim a frosty look, then spun on her heel and walked off without even bothering to exchange a word with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her bold move set the crowd ablaze, sending ripples of excitement through the onlookers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're really going for it! This is getting good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The top-twenty matches haven't even started yet, but Vadim, Jamar, and Bethan have all bet a hundred Sacred Crystals on themselves! Their showdown has already started at the betting table. Who knows who'll end up taking the championship and the big prize!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're all oozing confidence. It's a no-brainer that the champ will come from these three!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do we even need to talk about it? Who else could win? Just check out the odds. They're all around 1.2 to 1, while the others are at least 10 to 1!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Some are even over a hundred to one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those guys don't stand a chance. No one's </span><span>gonna</span><span> throw their money away on them. It's just a total waste."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha, couldn't agree more!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the crowd chattered away, Osborne finally showed up at the arena. When he saw the crowd gathered around the betting tables, he raised an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could clearly see the odds for his own win through the crowd. "One hundred to one?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but let out a soft laugh. </span><span>Ignoring</span><span> the tense stand-off between Vadim and Jamar, he shouldered his way through the crowd towards the betting table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief moment of thought, he took out a hundred Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm betting a hundred Sacred Crystals that Osborne will take the championship!" he said calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the words left his mouth, the crowd fell silent. All eyes turned to Osborne, and for a moment, they forgot about the rivalry between Vadim and Jamar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's name was no stranger to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the first dark horse to make it into the top twenty, an inner disciple with only an Ascension Eight level. Since yesterday, he'd been the talk of the town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But very few had actually laid eyes on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now here he was, betting on himself just like Vadim, Jamar, and Bethan, and for the same amount&mdash;a hundred Sacred Crystals. The crowd was </span><span>gobsmacked</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vadim, Jamar, and Bethan had the confidence that came with their superior might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What does Osborne have to fall back on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Is he really counting on those sky-high odds?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd looked at Osborne like he was a complete idiot, convinced he was just throwing his Sacred Crystals away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attendant, though, had a huge grin on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed more than happy to take Osborne's bet. He quickly snatched up the hundred Sacred Crystals and handed Osborne a receipt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile. Ignoring the stares around him, he took the receipt and turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, both Vadim and Jamar turned their attention to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vadim, with a look of disdain, scoffed, "An Ascension Eight inner disciple thinks he can follow in my footsteps by betting on himself to win? Talk about delusional! You'd better pray you don't run into me too soon in the arena, or I'll have you flat on your back, and you'll miss the rest of the matches. In the end, you'll be at the bottom of the rankings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Vadim wore a smug grin, reveling in his own arrogance.</span></p><div class="pagination">
