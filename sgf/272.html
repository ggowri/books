  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The revelation from Blake hit the crowd like a thunderclap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at Wesley in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face turned ashen with panic, but he forced himself to remain composed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted, "Nonsense!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Ashford family is a prestigious family; how could we possibly do such things? This is all slander, a scheme by Osborne and Blake to defame me and the Ashford family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you slander me! I will make sure you die for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his hand, Wesley signaled his bodyguards to move. They rushed towards Blake, intent on killing him to ensure he could not talk further, truly silencing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Clarissa's bodyguards would not let this happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene turned chaotic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched Wesley with a cold smile. Wesley was just lashing out in desperation. Regardless of how Wesley tried to explain, the truth was evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone who investigated would find the connection between the Ashford family and the Scarlet Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ashford family's reputation was ruined, and even if Blake was killed, the damage was done. Osborne waved his hand, allowing Clarissa's bodyguards to clear the area, letting them deal with Blake and the other Scarlet Gang members, effectively eliminating them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that moment, Osborne's Satan's Eye started throbbing violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is happening?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there any danger?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could Wesley still be planning to kill me? No, Wesley alone could not create such a strong sense of danger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression changed abruptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sensed something wrong and quickly activated his Satan's Eye, scanning the surroundings to identify the problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He soon discovered the issue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne saw that among the guests, at least dozens were slowly moving towards Clarissa amidst the chaos, their expressions cold as they reached into their clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using his X-ray vision, he saw that they were carrying firearms, not ordinary ones but highly advanced weapons!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face turned pale with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "How was this possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For security reasons, all guests were screened to ensure they did not carry weapons, including Clarissa's bodyguards. How had these guests smuggled such advanced weapons in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without time to ponder further, Osborne saw that these people had aimed their guns at Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shouted, positioning himself in front of Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, gunshots rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of guests hidden in the crowd opened fire simultaneously, their bullets raining down on Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa, caught off guard, could not react in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, Osborne had already taken action. His ocular energy halted all the bullets in mid-air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the bullets suspended, the shooters' expressions changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged glances and quickly abandoned their guns, rushing towards Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rapid gunfire caused panic among the crowd. People scrambled to escape, further adding to the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, assassins came in front of Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa tried to defend herself but was stopped by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do not make a move and keep your strength hidden."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne whispered to Clarissa, "These assassins are likely just the cannon fodder! The real experts have not shown up yet. Let the bodyguards handle this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa looked serious and finally nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguards immediately engaged in combat with the assassins. Donna arrived, her face filled with fury as she unleashed a flurry of stone spikes, piercing through the assassins' bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn assassins, still not giving up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna's cold attack could have wiped out the assassins instantly if not for the crowded chaos where she feared hitting innocent bystanders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne knew these assassins were merely a distraction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne maintained his focus, the Satan's Eye continued scanning for the real threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, an unexpected development occurred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thud!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A panicked guest suddenly collapsed, unconscious on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he was just the beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thud! Thud!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More and more guests collapsed, one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression changed drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sensed a peculiar force spreading through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out, the air is poisoned!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shouted, immediately holding his breath. Despite this, he had already inhaled some of the toxic air, feeling dizzy and disoriented. Fortunately, his robust physique allowed him to expel the toxin quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But others were not so fortunate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone </span><span>present</span><span>, including Clarissa's bodyguards, fell unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Donna, after a few shaky steps, collapsed in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, only Osborne and Clarissa remained standing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone else was incapacitated by the poison.</span></p><div class="pagination">
