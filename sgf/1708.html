  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone wants to go outside?" Osborne stared in disbelief at the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had initially planned to step out with just Anastasia to make a name for themselves and search for his parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, it seemed everyone was eager to join him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After spending twenty years in the Dimensional Microcosm, it was no surprise they were all itching to experience what the outside world had to offer, especially now that they were in Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne finally relented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, alright! But you should know that Celestara is extremely dangerous, and the situation is not very friendly to the Human Community. What I have planned is even riskier, and we might run into Deity King warriors. So, everyone needs to be careful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, excitement rippled through the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally! We're getting out!" Bryce exclaimed, practically bouncing with enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian, the God of Star and Divine Shadow, soon joined them. They hesitated for a moment before deciding to stay back in Hope Haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian chuckled. "You youngsters have all the energy. We'll sit this one out! Besides, our strength doesn't quite match yours, and we'd probably just be a burden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll focus on our training here and aim to break through to Deity King as soon as we can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, understanding their perspective.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, there's no rush to break through to Deity King. Just let things unfold naturally! It's important to wait until your Divine Body reaches Level Seven before attempting the breakthrough. That way, you'll be better prepared for what's ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian agreed, giving a thoughtful nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne then turned his attention to the God of Star and Divine Shadow. Their talents were the weakest among the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star had a Divine Body that was only Level Five, while Divine Shadow was slightly better, sitting at the peak of Level Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their current potential, they wouldn't be able to break through to Deity King; they might only reach Quasi-Deity King at best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne had plenty of Celestial Crystals for them to use, which would enhance their potential significantly. With enough effort, they might still become Deity Kings in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This situation mirrored that of many members of the Blood Demon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of them also had Level Five Divine Bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To break through to Deity King, they needed to use enough Celestial Crystals to boost their potential, at least getting their Divine Bodies up to Level Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were three criteria for becoming a Deity King</span><span>: </span><span>level, Divine Body, and elemental essence, with the enhancement of the Divine Body being the most challenging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, they had more than enough Celestial Crystals to facilitate this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Osborne, along with Anastasia, Zoe, Mila, Bryce, and Kendra, left Hope Haven and arrived at the Divine Peak Nine base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the energy here wasn't as rich as in Hope Haven, the excitement in the air was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce's enthusiasm was contagious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So this is Celestara? I am ready to take on the warriors of Lord Malevolence! I'm going to defeat all of you and drive you out of Celestara!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what's our next move?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't wait to challenge those super geniuses and give them a real beating!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Bryce, a bit speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly began to think through their next steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plans often changed, and with Zoe, Mila, Bryce, and Kendra wanting to explore Celestara, he realized he needed to adjust his original strategy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was deep in thought, his wrist terminal suddenly vibrated, alerting him to a new message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was from Hannah of the Mystic Feather Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's brows furrowed in surprise. Hannah was reaching out to him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly opened the message, and his expression hardened as he read the contents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, my identity has been exposed! Members of the Bowman family from the Paramount Supreme Clan somehow know I was the one who defeated Tobey. Now, they suspect I was the one who killed him! I'm surrounded by their experts, and I might not escape!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I might die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sending this message not because I want you to come to rescue me</span><span>, </span><span>that would be a death wish! I just wanted to say goodbye. I'm so sorry we couldn't make you part of the Gellar family. I regret that I couldn't marry you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I had another chance, I wouldn't push for you to marry into the Gellar family. I'd be happy just to be with you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, please, live well!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I believe you can change the dire situation of the Human Community in Celestara!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In my heart, you're truly incredible! Goodbye!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne finished reading Hannah's message, his face drained of color.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's identity had been compromised!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bowman family not only knew that she had hidden her identity to defeat Tobey but also suspected that she was the murderer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she was cornered by the very people who would likely end her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mind raced with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah was in grave danger! He felt a surge of panic; after all, he was the one who had killed Tobey, and now, Hannah was suffering because of him. Moreover, Hannah was his friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mystic Feather Clan and the Gellar family had supported the Human Community of Wild Flame City on numerous occasions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whatever the reason, there was no way Osborne could allow Hannah to be killed by the Bowman family.</span></p><div class="pagination">
