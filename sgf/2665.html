  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix looked at Osborne with disdain while observing the surroundings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, he confirmed that Osborne had come alone and there was no one else around.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Adriana, who protected Osborne, was not around at the moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix completely relaxed and sneered, "Osborne, you know what? The first time I heard your name, I felt disgusted. Because over a thousand years ago, there was someone in the Royal Family also named Osborne. He was a bastard, a bastard everyone could bully."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He smiled and continued, "Although you're not him, you share the same name. That really annoys me. Plus, you actually embarrassed the Royal Family at the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, which makes me want to kill you even more. Unfortunately, I never found the chance."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But now, you actually showed up in front of me. How could I not grant your wish and send you to hell? If you obediently hand over the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket, I'll let you die a bit more comfortably. Otherwise, I'll torture you just like I did that Osborne back then, making you regret being alive."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Hendrix's eyes were filled with cruelty.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Osborne couldn't help but laugh. At this moment, the killing intent in his eyes grew even colder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't expect Hendrix to bring up his past self, and his words were still full of disdain and contempt.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since that's the case, Osborne didn't want to hide anymore. After all, in his eyes, Hendrix was already a dead man.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He calmly said, "Hendrix, I am actually the bastard of the Royal Family you mentioned. What I just said about settling things was actually to resolve the hatred from over a thousand years ago when you humiliated and tortured me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Hendrix was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said in shock, "What did you say? You're the bastard Osborne I humiliated and tortured over a thousand years ago? Impossible! Your appearance and personality are completely different from that bastard. Your age doesn't match that bastard either."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Hendrix completely did not believe Osborne's words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and calmly said, "Those are indeed different because the bastard Osborne you mentioned is already dead. The current me has gone through reincarnation, and the bastard you referred to was just my past life."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? Reincarnation?" Hendrix froze, staring at Osborne in disbelief, frowning tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't believe me?" Osborne sneered, "Do you know why I broke your sister Seraphina's legs at the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix frowned and said, "Why? Of course, it's because my sister said she would break your legs, so you deliberately wanted to take revenge on her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Hendrix's face was filled with killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne shook his head and said, "No! It actually has nothing to do with what she said. I broke your sister's legs because I never forgot how, more than a thousand years ago, you broke one of my legs and even threatened me not to use any healing medicine, forcing me to lie in bed for a month."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, I broke your sister's legs not because she threatened me, but because I wanted revenge on you. You broke one of my legs back then, so I made sure to break your sister's legs right in front of you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course, that's nothing. Such revenge can't make me let go of my hatred for you. So, now I've come before you. I will first shatter your leg bones piece by piece, then break every bone in your body bit by bit, including your skull. I will return all the humiliation and torment you gave me back to you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne's eyes had turned blood-red, filled with killing intent. "Hendrix, are you ready? Are you ready to face my revenge? Are you ready to go to hell?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne unleashed immense power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix was completely stunned. "Are you really that bastard? Have you truly returned from reincarnation? Do you still retain the memories of your past life? Has your cultivation level already reached Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Hendrix was utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The things Osborne mentioned were secrets of the Royal Family. Even other members of the Royal Family didn't know that he had broken one of Osborne's legs and threatened him not to treat it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since Osborne could reveal this matter, it was enough to prove his identity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne truly returned from reincarnation to seek revenge on him!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, what truly shocked Hendrix was Osborne's cultivation level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before entering the Celestial Spire, Osborne had not yet reached Empyrean Sacredness. Moreover, at that time, Hendrix had already achieved Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Hendrix's eyes, Osborne at that time was nothing more than an ant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But how many days have passed since then?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix was still at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, while Osborne had already reached Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, just one cultivation level behind Hendrix.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glared at Osborne angrily and gritted his teeth, "So what if you're that bastard's reincarnation? So what if your cultivation level has reached Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection? Want to seek revenge on me? You're not worthy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You should have kept hiding your true identity. Wait until you have enough strength to come for me, and maybe you could really succeed in your revenge. But you're too impatient. Now that I know who you are, there's no way I'll let you live. You bastard should go to hell!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Hendrix unleashed a terrifying power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, his cultivation level was infinitely close to Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness. He was absolutely confident he could kill Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne smiled again. "Hendrix, you're too confident. Since I dare to appear before you and tell you the truth, it means you're already a dead man in my eyes. Go ahead! You'll soon understand what true despair feels like."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne beckoned to Hendrix.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn&rsquo;t take out the Bloodwrought Bow because, with his current strength, even if he controlled his power, he might still end up killing Hendrix outright.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Osborne's eyes, Hendrix was already no match.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he wouldn&rsquo;t kill Hendrix easily. The humiliation and torment Hendrix inflicted on him in his past life had caused him immense pain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn&rsquo;t want to simply kill Hendrix outright.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted to ruthlessly torment and humiliate Hendrix, to unleash all his anger and hatred on him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he didn&rsquo;t take any weapon and gestured at Hendrix. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing his actions, Hendrix was furious. &ldquo;You damn bastard! You&rsquo;re courting death! You have no right to act so arrogant in front of me. You want to fight me without weapons? Who do you think you are? Since you want to die, I&rsquo;ll grant your wish.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Hendrix launched an attack directly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He swung the Supreme Sacred Artifact. Terrifying power erupted wildly, instantly engulfing Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Osborne simply threw a light punch.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a boom, Hendrix's powerful attack was shattered by Osborne, like fragile glass smashed by a stone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation left Hendrix utterly shocked. "Impossible!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix's expression turned serious. He clenched his teeth and unleashed his power wildly. "Die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered and once again simply threw a light punch.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a boom, all the power Hendrix unleashed was effortlessly destroyed by Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix was stunned. "Impossible!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
