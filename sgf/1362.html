  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia was losing control. Her emotions spiraled wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She screamed in a frenzy, her face a battleground of conflicting feelings&mdash;madness and resentment intermingled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy radiating from her intensified, causing the entire dimensional portal to tremble violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression shifted to one of alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop it, Ophelia! Do you want to destroy the dimensional portal?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that happens, none of us will ever reach </span><span>Celestara</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And if the portal collapses, it will trigger spatial tide! Even with my spatial power, I'd be in deep trouble in a tidal wave like that!" he shouted urgently, desperation lacing his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Celestara</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Destroy the dimensional portal?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial tides?" Ophelia murmured, her eyes suddenly lighting up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! I want to go to </span><span>Celestara</span><span>! I've been waiting in that great chasm for the portal to open, and then you showed up and opened it for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going back to </span><span>Celestara</span><span>! I want to reclaim everything that belongs to me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Why should I go to </span><span>Celestara</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blue Planet is my home!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want to go! And why can't you forgive me? I've already apologized! Why won't you come back to me? Why are you treating me like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you're better than me, don't you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm in so much pain! Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Ophelia clutched her head, wailing loudly as tears streamed down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood there, dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It dawned on him that Ophelia was likely struggling with a clash of memories. Her identity as Ophelia on Blue Planet was colliding with her existence as the God of Time in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>. This conflict was causing her to unravel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This situation was absurd!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logically, the memories of the God of Time should have easily integrated with those of Ophelia. For the God of Time, Ophelia's experiences were just a fleeting chapter in her long life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But perhaps Ophelia's obsession was too strong. She was unwilling to let go of her identity as Ophelia, and since this body truly belonged to her, the memories from Blue Planet were fighting against those of the God of Time in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why she appeared utterly deranged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt no pity for Ophelia's plight. Ever since she had forced him into divorce, he had buried his feelings for her deep within himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But of all the times for her to lose her grip on reality, it had to be now, while Osborne was traversing the dimensional portal. This was a recipe for disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Ophelia destroyed the portal, it would undoubtedly trigger a spatial tide, and who knew where they would end up?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could end up lost forever in the depths of space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing the gravity of the situation, Osborne called out again, "Ophelia, please calm down! We can sort everything out once we reach </span><span>Celestara</span><span>! Just take a breath!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ophelia only grew more frantic, her power surging uncontrollably. Even Osborne could feel the overwhelming danger; the dimensional portal shook violently, threatening to collapse at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne finally understood why the Grand Elder of the Prophet Alliance had warned Eddie to keep a close eye on Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was indeed a volatile threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her current state, she could do anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia abruptly looked up at Osborne, her teeth gritted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calm down? You want me to calm down?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, I'll calm down if you forgive me and come back to me! Osborne, I love you, truly, I do! Please, just come back to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've changed, I've admitted my mistakes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice trembled with desperation as she moved closer to him, her eyes pleading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's brow furrowed in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That simple gesture made Ophelia halt in her tracks. She glared at him, her eyes burning with resentment and fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She muttered to herself, "He's disgusted by me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew he wouldn't forgive you! You're the God of Time, the mightiest Deity King! Why are you groveling for his forgiveness?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is humiliating!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is humiliating! No! I... I'm just trying to salvage this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're unworthy of being the God of Time! I'll erase your memories forever!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! You can't do that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to; otherwise, we'll live without dignity! I'll kill him after erasing your memories, so he'll disappear forever!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! I forbid you from doing that! You can't hurt him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's none of your business!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's face contorted wildly as if two personalities were battling within her. One, the God of Time, plotting to erase Ophelia's memories and murder Osborne, while the other, Ophelia herself, frantically resisted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This spectacle left Osborne dumbfounded.</span></p><div class="pagination">
