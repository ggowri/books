  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We won!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian clapped Osborne on the shoulder, his face filled with relief and pride. "Come on, let's go back! We can go home now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured the words, then shook his head, his expression turning cold and hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a wave of suppressed rage and murderous intent that he had been holding back surged from deep within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't going back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't avenged himself yet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo had killed his sister, Anastasia, and Zoe. He had escaped back to his stronghold. Earlier, Osborne had been forced to put aside his thirst for vengeance to focus on saving the Augustine family's members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, all their enemies had been vanquished, and the Augustine family members were temporarily safe. Osborne could no longer hold back the anger and hatred that burned inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed vengeance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to kill Gerardo!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to give justice to Anastasia!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't wait another moment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandfather, take everyone back. I'm heading to the Aberrants' stronghold to find Gerardo! He has to die! I'm going to tear him to pieces!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's face changed dramatically upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, don't be rash!" he said urgently. "If Gerardo has retreated to his base, we need to plan carefully. We don't even know how many defenses he has there. Launching a direct attack would be far too dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, everyone just went through a brutal battle. They need time to recover."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne clenched his jaw and shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Sebastian was right, and he was fully aware of how fortified the Aberrants' base was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the very least, Gerardo still had a thousand Class S clones at his command, along with numerous Class S Human Slaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne couldn't wait. He needed revenge immediately. He couldn't slow down because the moment he stopped, he would be haunted by the image of his sister, Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia had been the most important person in his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to avenge her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandfather, please don't try to stop me!" Osborne said through gritted teeth. "Take the Augustine family back to safety. Most of the Blood Demon members will go with you. I only need a thousand of them to come with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian saw the unwavering determination in Osborne's eyes and tightly furrowed his brow. But he knew that once Osborne made up his mind, it was impossible to sway him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, then I'll go with you!" Sebastian said firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, Grandfather. You need to stay and protect the Augustine family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head. "With you wielding the Godfather's scepter alongside the Blood Demon members, you'll be able to hold off the Eityreia Organization or the League of Divine Descent if they launch another attack on the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll bring Gerardo back," Osborne said, his voice filled with steely determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Sebastian could respond or try to dissuade him further, Osborne turned to First Augustine, the leader of the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First, bring all the Class S Blood Demon members and select six hundred more who are closest to breaking through to Class S. We're moving out! The rest will return to the Augustine Estate," Osborne commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Augustine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First Augustine replied without hesitation, immediately setting about making the arrangements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian sighed heavily, realizing he could no longer change Osborne's mind. He gave Osborne's shoulder a firm squeeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm coming with you!" Bryce stepped forward, his eyes blazing with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Aberrants slaughtered my eight thousand pirates! It's time to settle that score!" Bryce declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment, then nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne, Bryce, and a thousand Blood Demon members set off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waved his hand and tore open a massive dimensional rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given Osborne's current strength, transporting a thousand Blood Demon members via interdimensional travel was almost the limit of his abilities. That was why he didn't bring even more Blood Demon members along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, moving such a large group through interdimensional travel meant that each jump covered only about 62 miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, it was much faster than traveling by aircraft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Aberrants' stronghold was nearly two thousand miles away. Even by transport plane, the journey would have taken several hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With interdimensional travel, it would only take a few minutes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne didn't head directly to the Aberrants' stronghold. As Sebastian had pointed out, the Blood Demon members were exhausted from the brutal battle. They needed time to rest and recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stopped when they were about 120 miles from the Aberrants' stronghold, over the open sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's take a break," Osborne said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dozens of interdimensional jumps, he was feeling drained and needed to recover his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But while he was regaining his energy, there was something else he needed to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The six hundred Blood Demon members who were still at Class AAA needed to break through to Class S!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, Osborne's Blood Cross was once again filled with potent blood energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This energy came from the over three hundred Class S clones of the Aberrants and the more than three hundred Class S warriors from the League of Divine Descent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This blood energy was more than enough to help the six hundred Blood Demon members break through to Class S!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne carefully condensed drops of vibrant red blood energy and distributed them to the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They quickly absorbed the energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, all six hundred of the Class AAA Blood Demon members had successfully broken through to Class S, undergoing a transformation that significantly boosted their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight left Bryce completely stunned.</span></p><div class="pagination">
