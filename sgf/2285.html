  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed his steely gaze on the speaker, his voice icy. "And you are?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's face instantly beamed with pride. "Malcolm Darwin! I'm ranked 80th on the strength </span><span>rankings</span><span> and hail from the Celestial Zone up above."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a scornful chuckle. "Eightieth? With that swagger, I almost thought you were in the top 10! Turns out you're just an 80th-ranker."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm's face clouded over. "What's your deal, Osborne? You think someone ranked 80th like me ain't worth a damn?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, "What if I do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're looking for a fight!" Malcolm's eyes flashed with a glint of murder, but Conrad stepped in and held him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad stared steadily at Osborne. "Osborne, are you really not going to join my team? Sure, the Sacred Crystals I'm offering aren't much. But being on my team means you're one of us. If you ever get into trouble, I won't turn a blind eye. That's worth way more than a few thousand Sacred Crystals, don't you agree?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still carried that air of superiority, as if he were bestowing a favor on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm spoke up, his voice sharp as a blade, "Osborne, I don't think you get who Mr. Maurice is. He's one of the heirs of the Maurice family from the Stellary Wolf Clan. Does the Maurice family ring any bells? They're a top-notch Second-rate Power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With Mr. Maurice at 15th on the </span><span>rankings</span><span> and four of us in the top 100, </span><span>it</span><span> is a cinch </span><span>for our team </span><span>to make it into the top ten in the state duel. It's practically a done deal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied nonchalantly, "So what? The mere fact that you're on the team makes me want no part of it. To be honest, I can't stand you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then turned to Conrad, his tone light but laced with sarcasm. "Want me on your team? It's doable. Boot him out, and I'll think about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne flashed a calculated smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Conrad would never do it. After all, Malcolm was ranked 80th, while he was 108th. Conrad wouldn't dump Malcolm for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was just to get under Malcolm's skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>True to form, Malcolm's face contorted with fury. "You're really playing with fire!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Conrad and said, "Mr. Maurice, this guy isn't worth your effort. Some low-ranker in the 108th? He doesn't even deserve an invite. If it weren't for the rules of the Cloud-enshrouded Grand Complex, I'd teach him a harsh lesson right here and now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But when the state duel rolls around, if our paths cross, I'll make him eat his words."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad's features had turned frosty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the 15th-ranked fighter and an heir of the Maurice family, he wasn't accustomed to being rebuffed, especially by someone far beneath him on the rankings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad said icily, his eyes fixed intently on Osborne, "Fine. If you don't want in, that's your call. Just pray we don't meet in the state duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, you'll meet a gruesome end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let the threat linger in the air, then spun around and strode off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm threw Osborne one last venomous look, mimicking a throat-slitting gesture before trailing after Conrad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched them leave, his expression steely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're gunning for me in the state duel? Trying to scare me off? Well, then you'd better hope you don't bump into me either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not one to seek trouble, but I sure as hell won't shy away from it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're coming for me, then you'd better be ready to face the heat. If you actually make it to the top ten, I'll pack it in and vanish from the face of the planet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne spun around and headed back into his courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but rue his decision to come to Frost Peak City so soon.</span><br><span>If I'd known it'd turn out like this, I'd have waited until the state duel was just around the corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But there's no use crying over spilled milk now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, the wooden sign he'd put up did the trick. Not everyone was as full of themselves as Conrad and his gang. Most folks saw the sign, got the message, and left him alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time in ages, Osborne finally got some much-needed peace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was short-lived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Clara showed up. Osborne invited her into the courtyard, and she looked around, a smile of approval on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your courtyard in Zone One is way better than my place in Zone Two. I bet you've been bombarded with team invitations, right? With a rank of 108th on the strength list, people must be queuing up to get you on their team."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged. "A handful of them came asking, but I turned them all down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara let out a soft laugh. "I knew I wasn't off the mark about you. You're not the kind of person to take a back-seat role. That means you're aiming for the top ten, doesn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't try to hide it. He nodded, his face solemn</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to make it to the top ten in the state duel, no matter what."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, it wasn't merely about the fame. Reaching the top ten would guarantee Osborne a spot in the zone duel, and from there, he'd earn the right to participate in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel at the Royal Sepulcher. That was the place where he could pay tribute to his mother from his past life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nothing and no one was going to stand in Osborne's way of achieving that goal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Playing second fiddle to someone else?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not a possibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara said, arching an eyebrow, "You seem pretty confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've checked the leaderboard, haven't you? The top ten, heck, even the top hundred&mdash;none of them are easy pickings. Are you planning to throw cash around and assemble a super-team?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head. "Nah. It's just going to be the two of us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold up, what?" Clara blinked, clearly taken aback. "Just the two of us aiming for the top ten? Are you for real?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, his voice steady and resolute, "Why not? I've heard that a bunch of the top ten fighters aren't teaming up with anyone. Some are going it alone, and others are forming duos or trios. If they can do it, so can we."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara's eyes popped wide open. "But we're talking about the top ten here! These are superhuman-level warriors! You're ranked 108th, and I'm barely in the top 300. Do you really think our team stands a chance against the big dogs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne kept his thoughts to himself.</span><br><span>Not just one spot in the top ten&mdash;we'll grab two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just flashed a smile and said, "There's always a shot. We won't know unless we give it a go. But I'm not teaming up with anyone else. If you bail, I'll fight solo."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara went quiet for a bit, then broke into a grin. "I don't go back on my promises. If you're gunning for the top ten, I'm right there with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They chatted for a while longer before Clara took off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could tell she'd gotten a lot tougher since the city duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only two days left till the state duel kicks off," he mumbled, closing his eyes to catch some rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, the Zephyr State officials were going to announce the battle zones for the duel. Everyone would have a day to scope out the areas and get the lay of the land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was when Osborne'd get a good look at all his rivals&mdash;especially the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smile appeared on Osborne's face as he murmured, "Tomorrow, I'll finally get to see those top-notch fighters up close. Let's see how tough they really are."</span></p><div class="pagination">
