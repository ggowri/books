  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stubborn fool! You're jeopardizing crucial matters for the Radcliffe family. You're asking for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>York's palm crackled with vibrant energy as it shot towards Osborne. The colorful light circled around his hand, and even before the blow landed, Osborne's Satan's Eye began to pulse wildly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered, "What kind of power is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned but stood firm, ready to summon Devil's Light for a counterattack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before he could make a move, Clarissa stepped in front of him, arms outstretched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. York Radcliffe, if you want to kill Osborne, you first have to go through me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>York's expression hardened, and he instinctively withdrew his energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What nonsense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan's voice boomed like thunder. "Clarissa, are you really willing to throw your life away for him? Have you thought this through? Even if you can protect him now, can you guarantee his safety forever? I swear, if we don't end him today, he will </span><span>eventually bring about his own demise!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa flinched at her father's words, her face a mix of turmoil and resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon enough, her determination shone through. "I told </span><span>you,</span><span> I'll face whatever comes with Osborne. No matter how fierce the storms ahead, I'm here to share them with him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Osborne dies, so will I! I'll follow him to the ends of the earth, even to hell if that's where he goes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words hit Osborne like a wave of warmth, leaving him utterly touched. He had no idea just how deep Clarissa's feelings ran.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "Sweetheart, just hearing you say that is enough for me. How could I ever let you face that? Anyone who tries to keep us apart, I'll make sure they're the ones who suffer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was already considering revealing his secret lineage as the Godfather's grandchild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew it was a dangerous gamble, but for Clarissa, he'd risk it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan's face twisted in anger; his jaw clenched as his gaze fixed on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you really have what it takes, then stop hiding behind a woman! A weakling like you doesn't deserve Clarissa. You're only embarrassing yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted dismissively, grabbing Clarissa by the shoulders. "Clarissa, step aside! This battle is mine to fight. I can't back down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He moved to advance, but suddenly, his Draco Star Wristlet pulsed violently in a way that caught him off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression hardened as he realized what it could mean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "Could this be the activation of my fifth heir trial?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated, wrestling with his curiosity. He decided to check the Draco Star Wristlet for details about what the Godfather set up for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he opened the message, the contents of the fifth trial echoed in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Fifth Heir Trial! Officially initiated!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[The trial consists of three stages...]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Stage One - Travel to Pinchide City in Dampston, join the Augustine family as their heir, uncover the mole within their ranks, and eliminate internal threats.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Stage Two - Aid the Augustine family in reclaiming their former glory and becoming one of the three most distinguished ancient families in Dampston.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Stage Three - Identify all ancient families colluding with the Aberrants in Dampston, and eliminate their upper echelons!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reading the details, Osborne was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "This heir trial isn't just one task. It's a whole trio of challenges! And the difficulty? It's off the charts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first task seems manageable; all I have to do is sniff out a mole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm confident in my ability to uncover whoever's lurking in the shadows, no matter how deep they've buried themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the second stage? Helping the Augustine family reclaim their former glory and rise to the top three among Dampston's ancient families?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How on earth am I supposed to do that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From what Dylan said, the Augustine family has already fallen from grace. They're sitting at the bottom of the barrel among Dampston's nine ancient families, and they could be kicked out any day now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What can I possibly do to elevate them from the depths to the top three?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And if the second stage is that tough, the third one is bound to be a nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There are families in Dampston colluding with the Aberrants? The Godfather wants me to root them out and take down their entire upper echelons?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if I can identify them, how am I supposed to take them down?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many of those upper-tier folks are probably Class A masters!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow, tension mounting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trial was set in stone, and he had no choice but to tackle it head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "This fifth heir trial is tougher than anything I've faced before, and the risks are sky-high. Completing it in a short time frame? That's going to be a real uphill battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anastasia's health can't wait. I need to finish this fast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I need a solid entry point."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, his gaze landed on Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps her impending marriage to Alexander from the Paltrow family was the perfect angle to exploit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's hesitation, Osborne said, "Mr. Dylan Radcliffe, you want to kill me, but Clarissa would fight tooth and nail to protect me. This back-and-forth isn't getting us anywhere. How about you hear me out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "What do you have in mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied coolly, "I can convince Clarissa to leave with you. You can go ahead and prepare for her marriage to Alexander. But you can't stop me from being with her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I demand a fair chance against Alexander!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll head to Dampston and compete with him on equal footing. If I win...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I want Clarissa to be mine!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
