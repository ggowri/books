  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think you can save him? Dream on! You're going down with him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne reappeared just as the Deschanel Clan's Superior Deity was rushing to assist his comrade. With lethal precision, he thrust his divine artifact dagger forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the moment he struck, a jolt of shock coursed through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just a coward hiding in the shadows, huh? I've been waiting for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Osborne's surprise, the Superior Deity reacted instantaneously, slamming a palm toward his position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that split second, Osborne felt the world around him tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer divine power radiating from the Superior Deity was overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had two choices: retreat and evade the incoming attack, which he was certainly capable of given his agility, or press forward and absorb the blow while delivering his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, he chose the latter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce determination etched on his face, Osborne pressed on, driving the dagger deep into the Superior Deity's chest. His blade pierced through the deity's defenses, and the dark power within exploded violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Superior Deity's chest erupted, a massive wound gaping open as his Divine Body took a severe hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne was not unscathed; the retaliatory strike from the Superior Deity landed squarely on his right shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, half of Osborne's body felt as if it had been blown apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Ethereal Glow and Divine Body struggled to withstand such a devastating attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, this was a Superior Deity and a particularly strong one at that, even among their ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing the wrath of the Deschanel Clan's Superior Deity, Osborne, despite being a Junior Deity, managed to survive the onslaught without being obliterated. His injuries were grave, but they demonstrated the strength of his Ethereal Glow and Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer force of the blow sent Osborne hurtling backward; his body flung away like a rag doll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting his teeth against the pain, he quickly slipped into a parallel space, his form </span><span>vanishing from sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Superior Deity's expression hardened dramatically as he realized what had just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes darted around, searching for Osborne, but Osborne had vanished without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of Stealth Art is this? How is it so powerful?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Superior Deity's shock was palpable, but there was no time for contemplation. The Pantheon League warriors, seeing their opportunity, erupted with renewed fervor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of Intermediate and Junior Deities from the Pantheon League charged at him in a frenzied rush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take him down, and we'll live to fight another day!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warriors of the Pantheon League, now emboldened by their numbers, surged toward the wounded Superior Deity. They didn't care who had launched the sneak attack; all they knew was that they had to eliminate the two severely injured Deschanel Clan deities to turn the tide of battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, both wounded Superior Deities found themselves engulfed by a relentless barrage of attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their diminished power left them vulnerable, and they could do little more than cry out for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But their cries fell on deaf ears. The other deities of the Deschanel Clan were too entangled in their own battles, unable to break free and assist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph, locked in a fierce struggle with Helios, caught sight of the dire situation. Panic surged within him as he saw the two Superior Deities in peril.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to rush in to save them, but Helios was relentless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Helios, enough already! This ends here! I'm taking my people and getting out!" Joseph shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helios sneered, his eyes glinting with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave with your people? You, the Deschanel Clan, have killed so many of us in the Pantheon League already! And just when the tide starts to turn against you, you think you can simply walk away? Do you take us for fools? Or me for an idiot?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His anger was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The toll was staggering&mdash;close to a hundred divine warriors from the Pantheon League had fallen, nearly all at the hands of the Deschanel Clan's Superior Deities. Now, with two of those deities gravely injured, Joseph had the audacity to ask him to back off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not a chance!" Helios declared, intensifying his relentless onslaught, determined to keep Joseph pinned down and away from any thought of rescue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's fury ignited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> this is it, Helios? You really want to fight us to the bitter end, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helios shot back, a cruel smile twisting his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitter end? You really think we can still negotiate now? We're already at war! If you </span><span>want to talk about ending this, sure! Just hand over the culprits responsible for the deaths of nearly a hundred Junior Deities, and I'll let you leave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The audacity of Helios' demand sent Joseph into a rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hand over the culprits?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those one hundred slain were mostly at the mercy of the Deschanel Clan's Superior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way he could give up any of his own, especially not the five responsible for all this mayhem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes blazed with unchecked fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So be it! If that's how you want to play it, then let's see who ends up on top! Will it be the Deschanel Clan that wipes you out, or will you manage to exterminate us first? Let's kill!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
