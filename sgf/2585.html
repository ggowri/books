  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Yvonne lay unconscious on the arena, with her Supreme Sacred Artifact scattered around her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd murmured softly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the viewing platform, all the Royal Family members wore grim expressions, as if a heavy pressure loomed over them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one spoke, but everyone could feel the tense atmosphere.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne lost again!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After losing to Clara, Yvonne lost to Leroy. Both of them were once tied for last place on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings announced by the Royal Family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is undoubtedly the greatest humiliation suffered by the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before the battle began, everyone said that the nine princes and princesses of the Royal Family could all make it into the top ten, leaving the other hundred ordinary contestants to compete for the tenth spot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, with Yvonne's defeat, she has been pushed out of the top ten.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Clara and Leroy, two ordinary contestants, have already secured spots in the top ten.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The members of the Royal Family feel utterly humiliated at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Amid the surrounding chatter, the mocking remarks made them clench their fists in fury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What a disgraceful loss!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To win the match, Yvonne forcibly used the not fully mastered Supreme Sacred Artifact and suffered a backlash. Yet, she still lost. The battle only ended after Leroy knocked her out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Take her away!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Keep fighting!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Frederick finally spoke. His voice was so calm that no one could discern his thoughts from his tone. It was as if none of this had anything to do with him, as if Yvonne wasn't his daughter. Yvonne's injury and humiliating loss couldn't stir any emotional reaction from him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But his words were commands.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, maids from the Royal Family appeared and took the unconscious Yvonne away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The arena was cleared, and Osborne's fight began.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne calmly smiled and glanced at the Royal Family members, whose faces were filled with anger and discomfort but unable to erupt. He let out a cold snort.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "They're already feeling upset and angry? This is just the beginning!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne was merely the weakest among the nine princes and princesses participating in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel. Although the Royal Family felt her defeat was embarrassing, as long as the other eight princes and princesses performed well and dominated everyone to win the championship, it would be acceptable to the Royal Family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But how could Osborne let them have their way?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, he will deliver more defeats to the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom! They will go from anger to numbness, from numbness to fear, and finally to jealousy and inferiority!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everything is just beginning!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne is the first but definitely not the last loser because the next one, Yunus, will also fail, bringing shame to the Royal Family members.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After thinking, Osborne slowly walked toward the arena.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the other side, Yunus also stood up slowly with a gloomy face from among the Royal Family members and walked toward the arena.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne has the best relationship with him!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne's defeat and failure to enter the top ten brought shame to the Royal Family. He knows very well what kind of punishment Yvonne will face next.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made him even angrier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And he could only vent his anger in the arena!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yunus!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a prince said, "The face and dignity of our Royal Family cannot be lost again! You must win this battle! And win it beautifully, so that everyone mocking our Royal Family knows it was just an accident. Our Royal Family is still strong!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yunus turned his head to look.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The person speaking turned out to be the Crown Prince of Glorious Divine Kingdom, Weston Augustine!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yunus was shocked that Weston actually spoke personally.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took a deep breath and replied, "Don't worry. I won't let the Royal Family be shamed again! I will crush my opponent and let everyone witness the strength of our Royal Family!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's the best!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Weston said calmly, a cold light flashing in his eyes. "If there's another mishap, even if our parents don't punish you, as your elder brother, I won't let you off!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yunus was shocked again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said nothing more. After nodding, he walked towards the arena with an extremely serious expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was already waiting for him in the arena.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Osborne, a cold light flashed in Yunus's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, two super dark horses emerged, which was the reason for Yvonne's defeat, ultimately bringing shame to the entire Royal Family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As far as Yunus knew, Clara and Leroy, the two super dark horses, were very close friends with Osborne. There were even rumors that Clara and Leroy only stood out in the state duel and zone duel thanks to Osborne's help.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, since Clara and Leroy are super dark horses, could Osborne also be a super dark horse? Could Osborne be even stronger than them?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Yunus suddenly felt a bit worried and looked anxious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Osborne was the champion in the city duel, state duel, and zone duel! Meanwhile, Clara and Leroy were only runner-up and third place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seems only natural that Osborne is stronger than these two women.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Impossible! Having two super dark horses is already unbelievable! They must have had some kind of recent encounter, which allowed their strength to skyrocket!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne might have been stronger than Leroy and Clara before, but he has definitely been surpassed by them now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides, I'm not Yvonne! My strength is greater than Yvonne's. I'm ranked fifth on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, far above Yvonne's ninth, so there's no way I can lose!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yunus murmured and felt relieved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He took out a Legendary Sacred Artifact, a slender longsword. It was even longer than a regular spear, exuding an incredibly terrifying power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After getting ready, he stared at Osborne and coldly said, "Are you ready? I will crush you to win. I hope you can take one of my moves!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately laughed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't respond. Instead, he slowly took out the Bloodwrought Bow and directly drew the bowstring.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I hate nonsense!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, let's fight!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yunus became angry. "Since you want to lose to me quickly, I'll grant your wish!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fight!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Yunus struck. The sword in his hand trembled, and a highly concentrated beam of light shot toward Osborne at an incredibly terrifying speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The speed of this beam was too fast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But unfortuna</span><span>tely, something was faster than this beam. That was Osborne's Sacred Power Arrow!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne released the bowstring, the Sacred Power Arrow shot out instantly. Then, he put away the Bloodwrought Bow and turned to walk off the stage. His expression was calm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, his Sacred Power Arrow collided with that beam of light.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a loud bang, the sword light unleashed with Yunus's full power shattered like fragile glass. Yet Osborne's Sacred Power Arrow continued to shoot toward Yunus. Locking onto Yunus, it reached him in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yunus was shocked, but the next second, he was struck by the Sacred Power Arrow. His defense was easily torn apart. Then, an explosion followed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yunus spewed blood wildly and was flung off the stage. His head tilted, and he passed out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne had already reached the edge of the stage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Zorro, he calmly asked, "Can you announce my victory now?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
