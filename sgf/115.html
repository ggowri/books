  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had grown accustomed to Wesley's frequent blood-spitting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said coolly to Ophelia, "He must be suffering from some sort of illness. You'd better take him to see a good doctor. Otherwise, I'm afraid you'll be a widow before long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's face darkened, but she didn't argue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, she felt a pang of disappointment. Wesley, as the heir to the Ashford family, should have shown more resilience. At a time like this, he should be holding it together, no matter how tough things got.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By comparison, Osborne had a much stronger constitution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the three years he spent with the Caldwell family, he endured humiliation, torture, and pressures that most people couldn't even imagine. Even she thought Osborne was a bit of a pushover, but he never complained or faltered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about this, Ophelia felt a moment of distraction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a deep breath and turned to Austin. "Ms. Montague, hello. I'm Ophelia, the heir to the Caldwell family. We're in the business of jewelry design and sales. We'd like to buy some of these high-quality diamonds from you at a price 10% above market value. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia looked at Austin with hopeful eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was under immense pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Caldwell Group's rival, Luna Jewelry, had gained access to a substantial amount of top-grade diamonds thanks to Osborne. With Alison's handling, Luna Jewelry had quickly made a name for itself, squeezing the Caldwell Group's presence in the high-end jewelry market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many of the Caldwell Group's high-end clients had recently turned to Luna Jewelry for their custom orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Wise Order of the Caldwell family had harshly criticized Ophelia for the situation, demanding she find a way to turn things around quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To do that, she needed a significant supply of top-grade diamonds, which were limited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the Ashford family had provided some support, it was far from sufficient. She had to figure out a solution on her own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, seeing Austin cut out a large quantity of high-quality diamonds, Ophelia was eager to buy a portion, even at a premium.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She believed this was a reasonable request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Montague, what do you say? If you think the price isn't right, we can negotiate further."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin gave her a dismissive glance. "I'm definitely planning to sell these diamonds, but I can't decide who buys them. You'll need to talk to Osborne about that. If he agrees to sell to you, then fine by me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "I need Osborne's approval?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isn't he just a sycophant hanging on Austin's coattails? He's only good at picking uncut diamonds; how can he decide who gets to buy the diamonds?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her brows furrowed as she considered asking Osborne to sell the diamonds to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a difficult pill to swallow, but given the criticism from the Wise Order and the current situation of the Caldwell Group, she had to push through her discomfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Ophelia could finish her sentence, Osborne interrupted with a wave of his hand, "Ophelia, don't even bother. I won't be selling any diamonds to you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you need diamonds, try asking Wesley."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne turned to contact Alison, instructing her to come and take over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way he'd sell these diamonds to Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't forgotten what she'd done to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, Luna Jewelry was his company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was looking forward to the day Luna Jewelry would surpass the Caldwell Group and relish the sight of Ophelia's and the Caldwell family's dismay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, even though these diamonds weren't as top-notch as the previous batch and mostly just high-quality, they were still going to Luna Jewelry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon enough, Alison arrived with her team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching the scene unfold, Ophelia bit her lip, her face a storm of anger and envy as she glared at Alison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, no one cared about her feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Montague, Mr. Radcliffe, the appraisals for all the diamonds are complete. The total comes to 960 million dollars. I can round it up to a nice round number - one billion. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin and Barlyn's faces lit up with surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This figure was considerably higher than their own estimate. How could they not be pleased?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, they remained silent and looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison also turned to Osborne and said, "Boss, what do you think of this price? If we handle the deal well, we could still make quite a profit!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Agreed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin, however, was taken aback. "Boss? Osborne, you're the owner of Luna Jewelry? Why didn't you mention it earlier? Since it's your own company, the price shouldn't be this high! I think 500 million is more than enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right, Barlyn?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn nodded in agreement. "Exactly! 500 million is more than fair. If it weren't for Osborne bringing us into this, these diamonds wouldn't have had anything to do with us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head. "It's not the same. We had an agreement, and these diamonds would fetch at least 800 to 900 million anywhere else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's not the point!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group huddled together, debating the price. Eventually, they compromised at 800 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna Jewelry would still make a substantial profit, and Barlyn and Austin would not lose out much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the distribution plan, each of them would get 240 million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've hit the jackpot!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
