"To explain it simply, Zoe's power is still very weak. If we were to rank it, she'd only be a Class F metahuman. Normally, her power shouldn't be able to affect either of us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The gap between our levels and hers is vast. Yet her psychic power silently influenced both of us, indicating that her power could bypass the usual level restrictions. She could even affect top-tier Class A metahumans with enough time to use her power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Powers that can transcend level differences are called divine powers. Zoe's potential is limitless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Isa's explanation, Osborne finally understood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but be shocked. No wonder he had been affected by Zoe's power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for his Blood Cross that could shield him from such influences, he might have remained entranced by her singing, completely immobilized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If an enemy had attacked him in that state, he wouldn't have been able to resist. "It's terrifying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Usually, as a Class F metahuman, Zoe shouldn't be able to harm him at all, given that he could easily defeat Class C+ metahumans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Zoe had managed to affect him nonetheless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her divine power could influence even higher-class metahumans if given enough time, making her extraordinarily powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was impressed. If he had understood psychic power better, he might have considered taking her as a disciple himself. With the proper training and growth, Zoe could become a formidable force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zoe, Isa is an excellent teacher. She's stronger than me and knows how to help you improve your power. You should accept her offer," Osborne said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's eyes lit up, and she looked at Isa excitedly. "Really? I can be your disciple?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course!" Isa responded happily. "I'll do my best to teach you how to become a master. Don't be fooled by the fact that I don't have any power and am just a martial artist. I'm the perfect teacher for you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have many ways to help you enhance your psychic power. Also, psychic metahumans usually train in martial arts because the stronger the body, the stronger the mind. I can help you become proficient in both."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe didn't fully understand but was overjoyed. She respectfully bowed to Isa and said, "Ms. Bowin, I look forward to your guidance. I promise to study hard and will never let you down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's good, Zoe," Isa said, quickly helping Zoe up, her face beaming with happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Bowin, Osborne, I want to change my name. I've been an orphan all my life and don't know my real name. I chose the name Zoe Davis myself," Zoe suddenly said. "Now that I've found my sister, I want to have the same last name as her and you, Osborne. Can I be called Zoe Augustine from now on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Osborne with some trepidation, afraid he might refuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback but smiled, gently patting her head. "Alright. From now on, I'll treat you just like I treat Anastasia. If you want to take my last name, go ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe beamed with joy at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zoe, you'll stay here, learn from Isa, and take care of Anastasia. I have some things to attend to and need to head back," Osborne said, then drove out of the hospital and returned to the Radcliffe Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's sudden awakening had not signaled a recovery. Instead, her condition had worsened. The time she had left had shrunk from one year to just eight months.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the urgency, Osborne knew he had only eight months to complete six inheritance tests and elevate his status to Level 6. Then, he could send Anastasia to the Godfather's medical research facility. Time was running out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed to focus on the tests. But the fourth test was now his immediate obstacle. It was pursuing Clarissa and making her his woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, Osborne was reluctant about this task. He believed that love should be mutual and develop naturally over time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Godfather's test, which required him to pursue Clarissa, felt more like an arranged marriage, a strategic alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Osborne's perspective had changed. Pursuing Clarissa had become his singular goal. No matter the challenges or opposition, he had to succeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone who tried to interfere would become his enemy. He was determined to do whatever it took.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he drove, Osborne resolved firmly in his mind. Soon, he arrived at the Radcliffe Manor and immediately sensed something was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entrance was filled with law enforcement vehicles, and numerous armed officers guarded the gate. They even stopped Osborne's car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Something's happened?" Osborne's face darkened. The presence of so many law enforcement officers indicated a possible emergency at the manor. He couldn't help but worry about Clarissa.</span></p><div class="pagination">
