  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Luca finished speaking coldly, Osborne, Clarissa, and Emma's expressions all changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Were there more enemies?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca had been waiting for Clarissa and Emma to show up. He hadn't even been serious before, just playing around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned and scanned the area with Satan's Eye, but he saw nothing. Besides Luca and a few surviving Class AAA </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, there was no one else in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, a figure suddenly emerged from the shadows behind a nearby rock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a man in his twenties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man wore a mask, revealing only his eyes. He stared at Osborne, filled with hatred and defiance. Osborne found the gaze familiar, but couldn't immediately recall who he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he appeared, more figures emerged from the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another ten Class AAA </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> stepped out of the shadows. Two of the Titans held Donna, Barlyn, and two others, all unconscious and covered in blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four were completely unconscious. Their bodies were bloodied and tortured, dangling like toys from the Titan's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene left Osborne completely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've scanned that area countless times. I didn't see anyone or sense any presence. How could they have hidden so many people there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Donna! Father! Grandpa! Barlyn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa saw Donna and the others, her face full of worry. Her eyes reddened as she clenched her fists at the sight of their tortured bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gritted her teeth and immediately prepared to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The masked man said coldly, "If you make a move, I'll kill them immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was hoarse, clearly disguised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's body trembled </span><span>violently,</span><span> her face full of worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne squeezed her hand, signaling her to stay calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at the area where the masked man had appeared, suddenly realizing something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know now! It's the Dark Realm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've been hiding in the Dark Realm all along, so I couldn't detect you. Even though you're wearing a mask and disguising your voice, if I'm not mistaken, you're Palmers Rosenthal, the Godson of the Rosenthal family from </span><span>Yalynch</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Half a month ago, at the Godfather's birthday party, we fought, and you used the Dark Realm. But you were too arrogant, and I beat you before you could show your full strength."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared intently at the masked man in front, his expression icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't expect you to collude with the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>! Has the Rosenthal family allied with them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished speaking, anger flashed in the masked man's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He replied coldly, "Didn't think you'd figure it out so fast! Yes, I'm Palmers! But I'm here not because the Rosenthal family has allied with the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, but simply because I can't stand you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to fight you again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Palmers' eyes burned with battle intent. "Last time, I lost only because I was careless and didn't use my full strength! This time, I want revenge! Osborne, today we'll settle who's stronger and who survives!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you dare accept?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Powerful energy surged around Palmers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could sense that Palmers, like him, was only Class AA, but he felt even more threatening than the Class AAA </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Settle both victory and death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at Luca and the newly appeared ten Class AAA </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, his expression extremely serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, their situation was extremely dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enemy's strength was overwhelming!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To kill him, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> had sent twenty Class AAA </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had killed four of them and two others had exhausted themselves using their ultimate moves, there were still fourteen Class AAA </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> ready to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fourteen Class AAA </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> were terrifyingly strong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, there was still the formidable Luca.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the sixth disciple of the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, wielding the divine artifact, the </span><span>giant axe. His power was immeasurable. Even when he hadn't used his full strength, Osborne had struggled to resist him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Palmers wanted to settle the score with him, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Palmers was only Class AA, he had mastered the Dark Realm, a high-level application of powers. Within that realm, his strength would be incredibly dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, to this day, had not mastered any high-level power techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The threat Palmers posed was no less than that of Luca.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, the enemies they faced now were overwhelming in both numbers and strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, they only had three people on their side!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three Class AA fighters!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could they possibly win?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt immense pressure at that moment. He turned to look at Clarissa and Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of their expressions were equally serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too scared to fight? Then just surrender."</span></p><div class="pagination">
