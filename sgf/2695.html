  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as you can control him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hurry up and take action! Control him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne instructed Drum to take action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum immediately took action. He extracted the Soulbane Parasite from Weston's Soul Current Ocean, and did something that made the Soulbane Parasite obediently nod.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the Soulbane Parasite returned to Weston's Soul Current Ocean and parasitized again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"All set!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Heal his wounds, and he will wake up! Whatever I tell him to do, he will do!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum happily said to Osborne, as if waiting for praise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Drum, you're amazing!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and patted Drum's head. Drum immediately smiled with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Weston.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Weston's injuries were severe, as he had fully taken an arrow from Osborne's Apocalypse Bow. It was already very lucky not to be killed outright by Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he hadn't broken through to become a Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, Weston would have definitely been killed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But no matter how severe the injury, it was nothing in front of Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity could easily heal Weston's injuries.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne possessed the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. In fact, he could also use its power to control Weston.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He just needed to transform Weston into his Blood Golem.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne often did this when he was on Celestara Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back then, the Blood Demons were all Blood Golems he transformed; they were Osborne's most powerful allies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But after arriving on the Racial Convergence Planet, Osborne never used this ability again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because Primordial told him that using the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to transform others into Blood Golems had side effects. It would make his body and soul power less pure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each time he transformed a Blood Golem, it was like integrating impurities into his body and Soul Current Ocean, severely affecting Osborne's potential.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne never transformed another Blood Golem again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, if Drum couldn't control Weston's body through the Soulbane Parasite, Osborne was ready to transform Weston into a Blood Golem.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if it meant losing some potential, he wouldn't hesitate!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, now he could control Weston without losing potential!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne used the power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to heal Weston's injuries. Weston quickly opened his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, he wasn't actually Weston, but a Soulbane Parasite.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Weston's consciousness had been suppressed by the Soulbane Parasite. The one controlling Weston's body now was a Soulbane Parasite.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne did nothing to Weston.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if he wanted to take revenge on Weston, now wasn't the time. He would wait until he finished using Weston's body, then extract the Soulbane Parasite and restore Weston's consciousness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That would be the time for his revenge!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"From now on, you follow Osborne's orders! Whatever he tells you to do, you do it! If you dare disobey, I&rsquo;ll be very unhappy! And if I&rsquo;m unhappy, I&rsquo;ll destroy you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum said to Weston.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fear flashed in Weston's eyes, and he quickly nodded. "Queen Drum, rest assured. I will obey!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Queen Drum?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Drum in surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum stuck out her tongue. "I've already subdued it, so now I'm its queen!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He tried giving Weston orders and found no issues at all. Although Weston's body was controlled by a Soulbane Parasite, it had devoured Weston's memories, so it acted exactly like the real Weston.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, did you take control of him?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Adriana asked in surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana was overjoyed. "His strength has already reached Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness! He's not much weaker than me. Is he on our side now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne continued to nod. "But it's still not enough!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, next, I have prepared these plans."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne told Adriana his plans.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana immediately frowned. "The plan is good, but can it really be done? If you get surrounded by them out there, it&rsquo;ll be trouble!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head. "It must be done this way! Only then do we stand a chance!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Actually, Osborne's plan was very simple.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was going to take the initiative!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He believed that Frederick, eager to find them quickly, would definitely have those Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors spread out to search, which would give Osborne the chance to take them down one by one.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as Osborne could find them and defeat them, he could then control them with Drum's help.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this situation, their side would grow stronger and stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Frederick's side would grow weaker and weaker.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, even if Frederick found them, they wouldn't need to run anymore, let alone worry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They would just need to face him head-on!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A total of nearly fifty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said coldly, "At least thirty of them have already been controlled by Soulbane Parasites! I just need to find these thirty and take control of them all."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, our Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors will outnumber Frederick's warriors! At that point, the ones who need to run and fear won't be us, but Emperor Frederick!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, Adriana was still very worried.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She gritted her teeth and said, "I'll go with you! We'll act together, and the success rate will be higher! Even if we're surrounded, we'll have a better chance of breaking out!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, however, shook his head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No way! During this time, you must use the emperor fruit to enhance your strength! Because only if you become stronger can you deal with Emperor Frederick! Otherwise, even if my plan succeeds, at most we can defeat Emperor Frederick. Capturing him would be impossible."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If Emperor Frederick decides to escape, we might not catch him! If he hides somewhere and breaks through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, it will be trouble!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana still frowned. "Even if he breaks through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, we won't be afraid! I have enough emperor fruit. By the time Emperor Frederick breaks through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, I will have broken through too! By then, I'll definitely be stronger than him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head. "Still no! Because after breaking through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, Emperor Frederick might go directly into the deeper parts of the universe! How would we find him then?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The universe is vast. If he goes deeper into the universe, we won't be able to find him at all! So, we absolutely can't give Emperor Frederick the chance to break through!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We must defeat and capture him before he breaks through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness! Otherwise, based on what I know about him, he will definitely escape to the deeper parts of the universe!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked worried.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana opened her mouth, seemingly wanting to say something, but ultimately remained silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright! Then I'll stay here to strengthen my power!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Be careful!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded with a smile, "Don't worry. I have the Sublime Concealment Orb. They can't track my aura! This is a hunting game. They think they're the hunters, and we're just prey hiding."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But unfortunately, the real hunter is me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Osborne got ready to act.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that moment, Osborne suddenly remembered something very important.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was something he had wanted to do for a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now it's time to do it!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing that only close people like Adriana and Isa were around, Osborne took action directly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, his expression was somewhat excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because he was preparing to resurrect Alfreda, the princess from the Nature Elf Royal Family!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back then, Alfreda sacrificed herself to save him, standing in front of him and being killed by Isidore's power projection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's cultivation level was too low at the time, so he had never been able to resurrect Alfreda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And this had always been Osborne's pain!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, he finally had enough strength to resurrect Alfreda!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Alfreda should be resurrected!</span></p><div class="pagination">
