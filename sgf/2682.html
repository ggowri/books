  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>May seemed a bit anxious. "Osborne, what nonsense are you talking about? I have no idea about any eerie forest, let alone being trapped in it. You said branches pierced my vital points?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you think Ms. Alba will believe you? Look at me! My body wasn't pierced at all. I'm perfectly fine! I don't know why you're making this up, but it's ridiculous."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>May kept denying it, looking extremely agitated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the more May acted like this, the more Osborne was certain something was wrong with her. However, Osborne couldn't pinpoint exactly what the issue was. May was indeed still alive and still the same May as before, even her memories and way of speaking were identical.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, there was definitely something wrong with her!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne calmly said, "May, do you think I'm making this up? Then would you dare let Adriana check your body? If I've wronged you, Adriana will naturally clear your name after the examination. By then, I'll apologize to you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, May's expression suddenly turned even colder. She angrily said, "She wants to check my body? On what grounds? Just because you suspect me? I was the one who raised Ms. Alba. For so many years, I&rsquo;ve cared for and helped Ms. Alba wholeheartedly. Just because of your suspicion, she has to check my body? I don&rsquo;t agree!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>May looked at Adriana. "Ms. Alba, if you doubt me because of Osborne's words and think there's something wrong with me, you can just kill me. Living has no meaning for me anymore. I might as well die early and go see your parents."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, Adriana immediately showed a guilty expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne sneered and thought, "She's actually starting to play tricks, using past feelings to sway Adriana?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was now almost certain that something was wrong with May. The more May refused to let others examine her, the more Osborne wanted to check her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said coldly, "Adriana, if you don't want to do it yourself, you can step out for a moment. I'll check her. If I ultimately fail to find any evidence against her, I'll compensate her with a hundred emperor fruits. I think, if May is truly innocent, a hundred emperor fruits should be enough to make up for it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Osborne's words, May's face changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Adriana nodded. "May, cooperate with Osborne. As long as it proves you're innocent, you'll get a hundred emperor fruits. You might even become a warrior at the Imperial Empyrean Sacredness level, gaining extended longevity once again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Isn't this a good thing for you? If you refuse again, I can only suspect you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, May fell silent, her face looking terrible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Adriana almost believed Osborne's words. She couldn't help feeling a bit uncomfortable, but finally, she just sighed and said, "Osborne, I'll leave her to you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The only thing I can be sure of is that this body indeed belongs to May. So, please don't harm this body."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Alright. I understand."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Adriana disappeared from the Ice Crystal Hall. Instantly, only Osborne and May were left in the Ice Crystal Hall.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stared at May and said calmly, "May, will you let me check willingly, or do you plan to resist?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>May's expression instantly turned ferocious. "You're courting death! You're just an outsider. Even if Ms. Alba invited you to be the Honorary Elder of the Fairy Moon Sect, your status in the Fairy Moon Sect is still beneath mine."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You actually dare to doubt me and even try to sow discord between me and Ms. Alba? You must have bad intentions. So, I will kill you now to prevent you from harming Ms. Alba and the Fairy Moon Sect."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, May launched a fierce attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before entering the Skyfall Casket, May was already at the Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness level. Her strength was considered supreme in the entire Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although her gains in the Skyfall Casket were limited and she did not reach Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, her strength was immense and nearly at the Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, she exerted all her strength, aiming to quickly kill Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this scene, Osborne let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before entering the Skyfall Casket, he was absolutely no match for May and could even be easily defeated by her. After all, he was only at the advanced Empyrean Sacredness level at that time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Osborne had already reached Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, he was not comparable to an ordinary warrior at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection. Even when facing a warrior like May, who was at Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, Osborne was not afraid at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Facing May's full-force attack, Osborne summoned an incredibly ornate Panoply Armor, enveloping and protecting his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was an Inferior Imperial Artifact Armor!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, the Inferior Imperial Artifact Armor unleashed immense power, blocking all of May's powerful attacks. Osborne just stood there without moving an inch.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? Inferior Imperial Artifact Armor?" May was utterly shocked. "You actually possess an Inferior Imperial Artifact Armor? How could you have so many Inferior Imperial Artifacts?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, May felt a bit flustered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne calmly said, "May, do you want an Imperial Artifact Armor? As long as you let me inspect you obediently, after confirming there's no issue, I'll give you an Imperial Artifact Armor. Not just an Inferior Imperial Artifact Armor&mdash;if you want, I can give you a Mid-grade Imperial Artifact Armor, or even a Superior Imperial Artifact Armor. So, are you willing to let me inspect you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, May's face was filled with ferocity and greed. She shouted angrily, "You're going too far! I am your elder. How dare you humiliate me? Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>May launched another attack, further confirming Osborne's suspicions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sure enough, May has a problem!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't dare let Osborne examine her body because he would definitely uncover her problem.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, Osborne's Satan's Eye didn't find anything on May. After all, May's power was strong enough. Once she used her strength to protect her body, even Osborne's Satan's Eye couldn't probe every corner of it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is also why Osborne wanted to restrain May first.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>May unleashed her power more wildly. But this time, Osborne also took action. He hadn't forgotten Adriana's words about not harming May's body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Osborne didn't use the Bloodwrought Bow or the Apocalypse Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, Osborne was confident he could kill May with just one arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He let out a cold snort, unleashed Sacred Power wildly, and threw a punch, shattering May's attack instantly. The next second, his body vanished from where he stood and reappeared behind May.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a rope appeared in his hand, the Dragon Binding Rope, a Supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was the Supreme Sacred Artifact Osborne exchanged from the Royal Treasury. It had no other functions; its sole purpose was to suppress enemies by continuously channeling power into the Dragon Binding Rope after entangling them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, under Osborne's control, the Dragon Binding Rope swiftly shot toward May, attempting to bind her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>May was extremely panicked. Clearly, she hadn't expected Osborne's strength to be this terrifying. Fortunately, she reacted quickly and immediately prepared to dodge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You think you can dodge?" Osborne sneered coldly. Then, he took out another Supreme Sacred Artifact, the Invictus Seal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne coldly said, "Invictus Field!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the Invictus Field enveloped Osborne and May. No matter how May attacked, she couldn't break it. Gradually, she was forced into a corner by Osborne's Dragon Binding Rope.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, the Dragon Binding Rope wrapped around May.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, May's power was suppressed. She couldn't move and could only glare angrily at Osborne, her eyes filled with icy killing intent.</span></p><div class="pagination">
