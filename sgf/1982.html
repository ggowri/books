  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary stepped forward, determination etched on his face. "Dad, I'll take 10 Supernal Deity Kings and 10 thousand peak Deity Kings to corner the Baxter family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I promise, not a single one of them will escape!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They'll all face judgment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes burned with lethal intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alicia chimed in quickly, "I'll do the same! I'll lead 10 Supernal Deity Kings and another 10 thousand peak Deity Kings to trap the Faulkner family. No one from their side will get away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro nodded, impressed by their resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, then the rest of us will go after the ones hiding out. Their base is in Chilly Breeze Valley."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Osborne. "What do you think of this plan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head. "It's not enough. The Baxter and Faulkner families still have Ascension Three Supernal Deity Kings among them, while Uncle Zachary and the others are only Ascension One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings will struggle against Ascension Three. Here's what we'll do: each of you should lead fifty Supernal Deity Kings to handle the Baxter and Faulkner families. We need to ensure there are no surprises and wrap this up as quickly as possible&mdash;ideally before anyone even realizes what's happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Hudson family's strength shouldn't be fully revealed just yet; we need to keep that under wraps."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone frowned at this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about Chilly Breeze Valley? There are nearly a hundred Supernal Deity Kings there, including one at Ascension Four and at least five at Ascension Three!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was thick with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled reassuringly, "Don't worry, Grandpa and I will handle Chilly Breeze Valley. It'll be fine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet the others still looked skeptical, clearly unconvinced of Osborne's capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Jethro spoke up, his voice firm, "We'll follow Osborne's lead! We've got Chilly Breeze Valley covered, so you all focus on making sure the Baxter and Faulkner families don't get a chance to react!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reluctantly, the group nodded in agreement. "Okay! We'll see this through!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne added, "Then let's move out! Chilly Breeze Valley isn't far from the Faulkner family's location. I can use my spatial power to teleport us close to their base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then we'll strike together!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, let's show those traitors what happens when they betray the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes glinted with cold determination, and the Hudson family warriors felt the same surge of resolve, each one eager for action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the Hudson family warriors began to assemble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary, flanked by 50 Supernal Deity Kings and 10 thousand peak Deity Kings, set off towards the Baxter family's residence located on Apocalypse Island in the heart of Apocalypse City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given their strength, they would reach their destination in just a few minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they departed, Osborne made his move. "Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His spatial power enveloped over 100 Supernal Deity Kings and another 10 thousand peak Deity Kings from the Hudson family, and in the blink of an eye, they vanished from their location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, they reappeared over 100 million miles away in Twilight City, where the Faulkner family resided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twilight City was perpetually blanketed in snow, and Osborne's group materialized about 60 miles from the Faulkner family's stronghold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alicia, stay sharp!" Jethro said, his voice low but urgent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alicia nodded confidently. "Don't worry, Dad! Not a single member of the Faulkner family will escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, she led 50 Supernal Deity Kings and 10 thousand peak Deity Kings toward the Faulkner family's location, quickly moving to encircle them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go! Chilly Breeze Valley awaits!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne guided the remaining 70 Hudson family Supernal Deity Kings as they activated interdimensional travel, arriving at the snowy entrance of Chilly Breeze Valley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bram's memories had provided detailed accounts of this place&mdash;it was where the so-called "dead" members of the Baxter and Faulkner families were hiding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what's the plan?" Jethro asked, a note of anxiety creeping into his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given that Chilly Breeze Valley housed nearly 100 Supernal Deity Kings, including one at Ascension Four and at least five at Ascension Three, he couldn't help but doubt whether they stood a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without Osborne, Jethro would never have dared to take such a risk. But knowing Osborne had recently taken down Bram and Icy Nine put him at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Follow my command, then charge in!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave a few alive for the God of Light, but anyone who resists must be eliminated!" Osborne said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne began to take action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive blood-red lotus suddenly appeared behind him, radiating a pulsating energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolute forbidden zone!" he shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood-red lotus unfurled, showering the valley in a blinding crimson light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warriors inside Chilly Breeze Valley immediately sensed something was off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before they could react, panic set in as they realized their cultivation levels were being suppressed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was forced down to Ascension One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ascension Four Supernal Deity King struggled fiercely, managing to cling to Ascension Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that was as far as he could go&mdash;Ascension Two was hardly a match against the oncoming storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the others, even those who'd once been at Ascension Three found themselves helplessly trapped at Ascension One, unable to break the grip of the absolute forbidden zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said with a calm smile, "Now we can strike!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Inside, there's only one Ascension Two and 84 Ascension Ones!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just a heads up, Grandpa, you need to be careful, too. The moment you step into the forbidden zone, your cultivation level will drop to Ascension One as well! My absolute forbidden zone doesn't discriminate between friend and foe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro exclaimed, his eyes wide with disbelief, "Wait, you mean to tell me you can suppress their cultivation levels with an ability like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why didn't you mention it sooner? You had me worried for nothing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He threw his head back and laughed, tension lifting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's charge in! They're all just Ascension Ones now; there's nothing to fear! After all, we've got Osborne with us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Jethro led the charge, the warriors following him into the depths of the valley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, didn't join the fray just yet. Instead, he swiftly created 28 Spatial Clones, sending 20 of them deep into Chilly Breeze Valley to assist Jethro and the others in their battle against the Baxter and Faulkner warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the enemy's cultivation levels reduced to Ascension One, they stood little chance against Osborne's clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a head-on clash of equal cultivation levels, the clones easily overpowered multiple opponents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining eight Spatial Clones weren't idle either; under Osborne's guidance, they utilized interdimensional travel to position themselves near the Faulkner and Baxter families' residences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the battle had already begun for Zachary and Alicia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each had taken command of 50 Supernal Deity Kings and 10 thousand peak Deity Kings, launching a fierce assault on their respective targets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground trembled with the force of their combined power, catching the Baxter and Faulkner families utterly off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having been Dukedom Level Powers that had secretly betrayed the Human Community to align with Lord Malevolence, they never expected an attack to come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, their defenses shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, the slaughter commenced!</span></p><div class="pagination">
