  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vince's desperate cries pierced the air, instantly darkening Bancroft's expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, as the ruler and the most powerful warrior of a life planet, he managed to maintain his composure even with his son under threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" he barked at Vince, his voice cutting through the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vince fell silent, trembling slightly as he looked at his father with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft, however, ignored him, turning his attention to Osborne and Isa. A flicker of confusion crossed his face; their unfamiliar appearances and energy signatures&mdash;Osborne at Ascension Seven and Isa at Ascension Nine&mdash;made him relax just a fraction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">An Ascension Seven and an Ascension Nine dare to cause trouble on Necoton Planet? Talk about asking for trouble!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with Vince under Osborne's control, Bancroft couldn't act recklessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He forced a calm demeanor and inquired, "So, you two are foreign warriors? What brings you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a subtle smile. "It's none of your business who we are."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft frowned and kept pressing. "Then why'd you snatch my son? Did he tick you off? Or has the Phantom Tide Demon Sect done something to cross you? If so, I'm sorry. To show I'm serious, I'm willing to pay compensation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about a hundred thousand Celestial Crystals? Just let my son go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wore a sneering smile. A hundred thousand Celestial Crystals was no doubt a huge fortune for most Supernal Deity Kings, but it was laughable to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bancroft, are you trying to shell out that money to buy your son's life, or are you bribing me to hush up the Phantom Tide Demon Sect's slave-trading racket?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft scowled at the accusation. "Slave trading? You've gotta be kidding me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Phantom Tide Demon Sect is a reputable sect. We'd never get involved in such a shady business! There must be some mix-up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a mocking chuckle. "Bancroft, if you're gonna play innocent, then there's no point in talking anymore. We wouldn't be here without proof, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft fell silent, pondering his next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long moment, he finally broke the silence. "The hundred thousand Celestial Crystals is just to secure my son's life. As for the slave-trading matter... I'm willing to fork out a million Celestial Crystals! You return our slaves, and we'll just act like this never happened. We will treat you like family, sending you ten thousand Celestial Crystals every year!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what do you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished speaking, a menacing glint flashed in Bancroft's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, you can say no! But I reckon a smart guy like you won't pass up this deal. You should know the Phantom Tide Demon Sect has some heavy-hitting backers. My allies aren't ones to mess with!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but burst out laughing. "A million Celestial Crystals? Ten thousand a year for as long as I live? Bancroft, you're really laying it on thick! Looks like the slave trade is one profitable racket! But sorry, Celestial Crystals just don't do it for me. If you were talking about a million Sacred Crystals, I might give it a thought..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One million Sacred Crystals?!" Bancroft's face twitched, fury flashing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt that Osborne was mocking him with such an outrageous demand, clearly having no intention of negotiating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On Racial Convergence Planet, a single Sacred Crystal could trade for at least ten thousand Celestial Crystals&mdash;and even then, it was hard to come by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Very few would trade Sacred Crystals for Celestial Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One million Sacred Crystals meant a staggering ten billion Celestial Crystals. Even if he sold the entire Phantom Tide Demon Sect, he couldn't scrape together even a fraction of that amount.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft's voice was icy as he demanded, "What exactly do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No longer mincing words, Osborne continued, "I want to know who's backing you! And I need to find out where the Frenetic Storm Warband is right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft froze at the mention of his backer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His brow furrowed as he processed the implications. "Are you after my backers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne neither confirmed nor denied it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He simply replied, "That's not your concern. What you need to tell me is who's behind your slave trading operations. What's his identity? Where can I find him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne locked eyes with Bancroft, his gaze unyielding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't even think about lying to me. If you do, I swear I'll snap your son's neck right here! He's talented&mdash;an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King at such a young age. He has a bright future ahead, possibly becoming an Empyrean Sacredness warrior! It's no wonder you entrusted him with your most secretive operations. You're grooming him to be your heir, aren't you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bancroft, I doubt you want to be collecting his corpse today, do you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft's expression darkened further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a cold snort. "You think I'd betray my backer? You're dreaming! If he finds out, I'm as good as dead! If my son dies, I can have another, but if I'm gone... then there's nothing left!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So go ahead and make your move! But I promise you this&mdash;if you kill him, you won't walk away from Necoton Planet alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, a menacing glint flashed in Bancroft's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was caught off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft would rather let his son die than betray his backer? This was beyond his expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lowered his head, deep in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It seems that trying to force Bancroft to reveal his backer's identity by threatening Vince's life won't work. I'll have to come up with a different plan&mdash;one that really packs a punch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this in mind, a chilling gleam appeared in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Bancroft and said, "If that's your stance, then I've got nothing else to say! Since you don't give a damn about your son's life, I'll send him to the afterlife right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne tightened his grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before either Vince or Bancroft could react, Vince's neck was snapped with a swift motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything unfolded in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time Bancroft finally grasped what had just happened, his face contorted with pure rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying surge of energy exploded from Vince's lifeless corpse and barreled straight towards Osborne and Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bancroft bellowed, his body shaking with fury, "You'll pay for this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You killed my son! I swear I'll end both of you and make you pay dearly for what you've done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Bancroft unleashed his full might. A torrential wave of power crashed down on the two of them like a tsunami. Even a casual blow from him was as powerful as Lord Malevolence's all-out attack&mdash;truly spine-chilling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look out!" Isa shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression turned grim as she prepared to step in, but Osborne held her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got this covered!" he declared, his eyes ablaze with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Since you're not willing to spill the beans about your backer, I'll beat you and dig through your memories myself.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne's Sacred Power flared up, and he threw a bone-shattering punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air crackled with intense energy as the battle erupted.</span></p><div class="pagination">
