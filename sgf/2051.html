  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne stepped aside, curiosity bubbled within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't need Jaden to remind him that members of the Elf Race's Royal Family held an esteemed position in Elf City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rules were strict&mdash;no one was allowed to maintain prolonged eye contact with them, call them by name, or show any sign of disrespect&mdash;let alone attack them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the hundreds of thousands of regulations, many were specifically </span><span>about</span><span> the Royal Family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, there weren't many members of the Royal Family, making encounters rare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hadn't expected that before he even set foot into Elf City, he would find himself face-to-face with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Is this a blessing or a curse?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze was drawn back to the dimensional portal, where the golden light flickered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment it flared brightly, tall, elegant figures began to emerge. Osborne's heart raced as he took a quick glance, and he was utterly taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had imagined the Royal Family to be adorned in lavish attire, exuding an air of nobility and pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, what he saw left him speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne saw a group of strikingly beautiful and handsome Elf Race members, but they looked utterly disheveled, as if they had just escaped a brutal beating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were ragged, their clothes tattered, and their faces bore the marks of a recent fight&mdash;bruised and battered, they resembled beggars more than royalty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "Could these truly be members of the Elf Race's Royal Family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't been told otherwise, he would have thought they were refugees fleeing disaster, desperately seeking shelter among their kin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood frozen, his eyes wide, unable to tear his gaze away from the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you staring at?!" A sharp voice cut through the air, filled with anger and indignation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the crowd, a disheveled Elf man glared at Osborne, his face twisted in rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You lowly human dare to stare at us, the Royal Family? You've just violated Rule Number Seven of Elf City! Someone, seize him and give him a good t</span><span>en</span><span> lashes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a burly Elf guard sprang into action, drawing a long wooden whip from his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he swung it toward Osborne, the whip slicing through the air with a fierce whoosh, igniting with a blaze of fiery energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was headed straight for Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression hardened instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel the immense heat emanating from the whip; if </span><span>he was hit</span><span>, he would be left disfigured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than that, it would be a humiliation he couldn't bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination, Osborne wouldn't just stand there and take it. He swiftly darted back, narrowly avoiding the strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa?! You lowly human actually dared to dodge?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's a crime in itself! Now you're looking at a punishment of twenty lashes! If you try to evade again, it'll be forty! Eighty!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Each time you dodge, the punishment doubles&mdash;no limits!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Elf guard, furious at being outmaneuvered, swung the whip again, this time with even more force aimed straight at Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene left Jaden and his companions utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't anticipated that Osborne would provoke the Royal Family of the Elf Race&mdash;especially the notoriously hot-tempered Fire Elf Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a mess!" Jaden exclaimed, his anxiety palpable as he watched Osborne narrowly evade another strike from the Elf guard's whip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are we going to do? Someone has to help Osborne!" Letitia frowned, her worry evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help him? How? That's the Royal Family of the Fire Elf Clan we're dealing with! If I step in, I'll be in hot water too!" Jaden bit his lip, frustration etched on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Renata quickly chimed in, pulling Jaden back, "We can't intervene! Sure, we're all part of the Human Community, and we should support each other, but we can't afford to get involved in this. He broke the rules of Elf City, and rushing in to help wouldn't be justified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, these are members of the Fire Elf Clan! If we offend them, it won't just be us who suffer; even our families would be in danger here in Elf City!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We barely know him; it's not worth the risk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Renata's expression was resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Letitia sighed, her heart heavy, but she knew Renata was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly sent a mental message to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, stop dodging! Those are the Fire Elf Clan's Royal Family members&mdash;the most volatile and arrogant of them all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't help you right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just stand still and take a few lashes. It's better than provoking them further; otherwise, you'll really be in trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a wave of frustration wash over him as he heard Letitia's anxious warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had just dodged the third strike, and his anger was boiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All Osborne had done was glance at those so-called Royal Family members, and now he was facing punishment?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt utterly dehumanizing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had intended to keep a low profile in Elf City, avoiding trouble at all costs, but he refused to be treated like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, "Members of the Fire Elf Clan?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just because they have a short fuse doesn't mean they can humiliate me like this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just because they are Royal Family doesn't give them the right to whip me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression hardened. He understood Letitia meant well and was trying to guide him through this predicament, but he couldn't accept it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already shown remarkable restraint by only dodging their attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought to himself, "If they really push me, I'll just unleash my full power and take them all down. Then I'll leave Elf City for good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deep space is vast; no way they could catch me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that resolve, a menacing glint sparked in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He assessed the situation&mdash;there were nine Elves in total.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The forefront consisted of two men and one woman who appeared to be </span><span>young</span><span>; they were likely members of the Royal Family, each possessing a cultivation level of Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining six individuals seemed to hold a lower status, perhaps serving as guards or escorts. They too appeared young, but their cultivation levels were higher, reaching Ascension Five Supernal Deity King level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pondered, "Six Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings? Three Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They might seem stronger, but I'm confident I can take them all down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I use my absolute forbidden zone to suppress their cultivation levels, taking them out won't be a problem!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Do I just stand here or take action?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
