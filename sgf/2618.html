  <div class="container">"<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, Osborne saw nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crack still contained an incredibly terrifying power, capable of easily tearing apart the body of any strong being who had reached advanced Empyrean Sacredness or even Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, the Black Whirlpool surged violently, seemingly trying to seal the crack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Keep reinforcing it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At Frederick's command, all strong beings who had reached Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness desperately unleashed their power to reinforce the passage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, their expressions were all grave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could no longer speak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More than sixty strong beings who had reached Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness found it difficult to open the crack, so Osborne suddenly felt that remembering the coordinates here seemed meaningless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he came alone, he would be completely unable to pass through this terrifying Black Whirlpool to enter Necropolis City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne estimated that if he were alone here, he would need at least the strength of Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness to pass through the Black Whirlpool and enter Necropolis City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Emperor Frederick must have explored Necropolis City alone before, but this time, to bring us who haven't reached Empyrean Sacredness into Necropolis City, he had to invite Adriana and others..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Otherwise, Emperor Frederick would never be willing to expose the existence of Necropolis City!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne looked at Clara and Leroy beside him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Clara and Leroy had already recovered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the massive and terrifying Black Whirlpool above, they appeared utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What a terrifying whirlpool! I feel like just one glance, and my soul is about to be devoured. It&rsquo;s as if the moment I dare to approach it, I&rsquo;ll be torn to shreds instantly!" Clara murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do we have to go through this terrifying whirlpool?" Leroy's eyes were also filled with fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry! Emperor Frederick and those strong enough to reach Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness will ensure our safety. At least until we enter that place where only those below Empyrean Sacredness can go, we are safe," Osborne reassured Clara and Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy nodded, moving closer to Osborne, as if they could only feel safer by his side.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the others gradually recovered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When everyone looked up at the massive Black Whirlpool overhead, they couldn't help but show expressions of shock and fear, their bodies trembling slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Open it!" Frederick suddenly roared. As the incredibly terrifying power around him surged into the Black Whirlpool, the rift instantly grew larger, and the energy within became more stable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's now!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, follow me into Necropolis City! If we miss this chance, we'll have to wait another thousand years! Protect the juniors as we enter Necropolis City!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Frederick waved his hand, unleashing a force that shielded Seraphina and Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately looked a bit dissatisfied.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't expect Frederick to only protect him and Seraphina. As for the others, Frederick left them to protect themselves...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Given the situation, not only was Osborne stunned, but even Adriana was shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She originally wanted to protect Osborne, but seeing Frederick had already done so, she could only protect Clara and Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, everyone who hadn't reached Empyrean Sacredness was protected by those who had achieved Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness. Then, they charged toward the crack on the Black Whirlpool.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was surrounded and protected by Frederick's power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly pondered, "Emperor Frederick actually chose not to protect the other princes and princesses but came to protect me. Moreover, he only protected me and Princess Seraphina. It seems that Princess Seraphina and I hold a more important place in his heart than the other princes and princesses!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Does he think Princess Seraphina and I are stronger? Does he need us to help him obtain something? Is he afraid that if others fail to protect us, we might die here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought of a crucial point and sneered inwardly, "Do you expect me to help you obtain something? How could I let you have your way? Even if I get it, I will never hand it over to you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After thinking, Osborne observed the surroundings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, they had already entered the Black Whirlpool. Not far from Osborne, the terrifying power within the Black Whirlpool surged, and it was incredibly strange&mdash;something Osborne had never seen before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The passage of the Black Whirlpool's fissure was very deep.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Frederick and those strong individuals who had reached Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness flew with them for several minutes, Osborne finally felt the surrounding power begin to weaken.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They seemed to be about to leave the Black Whirlpool.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What kind of existence is Necropolis City? What secrets are hidden within? How did the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet once gain power here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, even Osborne felt incredibly curious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, everyone suddenly felt a burst of light before their eyes. They had broken out of the Black Whirlpool and entered a completely different world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, aside from Frederick, who had been here many times before, the others couldn't help but be stunned as they looked at this world, their eyes filled with shock and astonishment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This world was too peculiar.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This place was neither the cosmos nor deep space but an incredibly viscous world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It felt as if they were inside a giant egg, surrounded by viscous egg white.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ahead of them stood a massive pyramid-shaped structure. It was so enormous, even larger than a small planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they looked closely, they would find that the pyramid-shaped structure was made up of a massive tower and nine huge rocks. At the top was a giant tower, the second layer had two rocks, the third layer had three rocks, and the bottom layer had four rocks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were a total of nine rocks and one tower.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The tower was so massive, like a small planet. A person standing in front of it seemed as tiny as dust, while the nine rocks resembled nine continents.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On top of each rock was an enormous coffin, positioned right at the center.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How big was that coffin?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its length was at least tens of thousands of miles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Is this a coffin?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was utterly shocked. The nine coffins emitted a bronze glow, looking incredibly terrifying. The aura surrounding them made him tremble uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Nine massive rocks holding nine enormous coffins? Are they suppressed by a towering structure above?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Is this Necropolis City?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was extremely shocked, but what shocked him even more was the environment here. Perhaps others didn't know what it was like, but Osborne knew...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had once been to a place similar to this, and that was Chaotic World.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chaotic World existed before the cosmos was born.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt that the environment around Necropolis City was very similar to Chaotic World, but they were not exactly the same.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There's no Primordial Energy here!" Osborne murmured. Then, he looked around in surprise, while everyone else was also stunned by the peculiar sights of Necropolis City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is Necropolis City!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Frederick finally spoke, "Necropolis City is made up of nine floating Skyfall Monoliths, and each Skyfall Monolith holds a Skyfall Casket, all suppressed by the Celestial Spire at the top. Within the Skyfall Caskets, there are countless opportunities, treasures, and powers that can make each of us stronger."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, if we want to open the Skyfall Caskets, we must first obtain the keys..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The key is in the Celestial Spire!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick pointed to the tower at the top, his eyes filled with excitement and enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Only those who haven't reached Empyrean Sacredness can enter the Celestial Spire."</span></p><div class="pagination">
