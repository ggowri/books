  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox cast a skeptical eye on Anastasia, Zoe, and the rest, and Osborne couldn't suppress a soft chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evidently, Maddox had yet to witness their true mettle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had unwavering faith in their abilities. Taking on a Wooden Golem of the same cultivation level was no Herculean task. No matter how formidable the Golem, he was certain they could rise to the occasion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they couldn't handle this, it would spell bad news for all the disciples of Mystic Sirius Sect's Peak Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It might even imply that no one within the sect was up to the challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Osborne was lost in these thoughts, Terrance's sneering voice cut through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do they hail from some backwater life-bearing planet? A so-called genius from a puny world? That's a laugh! Every year, hordes of so-called prodigies from small and micro life-bearing planets flock to Racial Convergence Planet. But how many actually make the cut to join </span><span>the </span><span>Mystic Sirius Sect through the assessments?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back on their home turf, they're treated like royalty, strutting around all high-and-mighty, thinking they're invincible. But here? This is Racial Convergence Planet, the heart of the Glorious Divine Kingdom! Those so-called geniuses are nothing more than run-of-the-mill folk in this grand scheme of things!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly, I doubt any of them will pass the practical assessment!" Terrance's disdain was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox let out a cold huff but didn't argue, still focused on Osborne. He knew Terrance's words held some truth, even if they were a bit extreme.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the so-called geniuses from small life-bearing planets faded into obscurity when they arrived at Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They simply couldn't compete with the local talent, whose skills were light-years ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, Maddox recognized that Osborne and Isa were exceptions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when it came to Anastasia, Zoe, and the others, he felt a twinge of doubt. Would they be able to pass the practical assessment?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, breaking the tension, "Looks like we have no choice but to participate in this practical assessment, right? Otherwise, we'll have a pack of dogs nipping at our heels."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrance's expression turned icy at Osborne's words. "Are you insulting me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looking for death? Or do you really think Maddox can protect you? You dare to talk back? Do you want me to end you right here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne simply smiled, "I don't believe you can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrance bellowed, his power surging forth like a tempest and bearing down on Osborne, " You're just begging for a beating!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think a measly Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King can throw his weight around in front of me? If you've got any courage left in you, step into the arena! I'll even let you have the advantage of using just one of my hands. It'll be an all-or-nothing fight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you up for it?" he goaded, a smug look on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words sent a jolt of excitement through the onlookers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like we're in for a real spectacle!" someone yelled, barely containing their enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on! That bloke won't take the challenge. He's only an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King. How could he possibly have the nerve to face off against Terrance? Even if Terrance held back, he could still crush this guy without breaking a sweat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't fret, he'll surely back out with his tail between his legs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne listened to the crowd's buzz, a frosty smile appeared on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Step into the arena? You've got to be joking. You're not even in my league. I have no interest in picking on you, and I definitely don't want to start my journey at </span><span>the </span><span>Mystic Sirius Sect with a bloody fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So why don't you just slink off and save yourself the embarrassment?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just a practical assessment, isn't it? We'll take part."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrance's face contorted with disdain. "Is that your way of chickening out? How utterly pitiful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd burst into laughter, ridiculing Osborne for seemingly being too scared to take on Terrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get ready for the practical assessment," Terrance snapped, not wanting to waste another second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, as an Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King and the fourth-ranked inner disciple of Peak Seven, it was beneath him to keep haggling with a newbie like Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the idea of Osborne and his friends entering the assessment brought a cold smirk back to his face. Terrance couldn't wait to see how they'd fare against the Golems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Just wait these guys make complete idiots of themselves!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">You think you can ace the practical assessment? Beat a Wooden Golem at the same cultivation level? Please! I'd be shocked if any of you could pull that off. And here's the kicker&mdash;My teacher is in charge of those Wooden Golems. He knows there's a batch that's off-the-charts powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those Wooden Golems were the very first ones made by Peak Lord Ms. Olsen! Each one of them is way stronger than the others. Even I'd have a tough time going up against that batch at the same cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Just wait till these fools get flattened by the Golems! Maddox thinks he can get them into </span><span style="font-style: italic;">the </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Mystic Sirius Sect, specifically Peak Seven? That's hilarious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Terrance shot a look at the guy behind him and quickly sent a mental message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jamaal, you take care of the Wooden Golems yourself. Fetch that special batch..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamaal's eyes sparkled with excitement at the order and he scurried off without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, they reached a huge arena where the Wooden Golems were all set up, raring to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news had spread like wildfire, and thousands of onlookers flocked to the scene, itching to see the newbies take on the fearsome Golems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrance, Brie, and Jamaal were standing on the sidelines, their eyes twinkling with amusement as they watched Osborne and his companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's </span><span>gonna</span><span> be the first?" Maddox looked at Osborne, his face full of worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne just flashed a calm and composed smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Bryce stepped forward. "I'll lead the way! I'm the weakest among us, so let me go up there and size up these Wooden Golems. If I can't make it through, I'll just strike out on my own adventure..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a big grin, Bryce sauntered into the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his self-deprecating words, he practically oozed confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Going up against a Wooden Golem at the same cultivation level? Bryce couldn't have cared less.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The training they'd done in Hope Haven, fueled by a generous supply of Element Gold Crystals and Sacred Crystals, had taken their strength to a whole new level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only had he reached Ascension Three, but his elemental essence had also exceeded Level Ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce was fearless against a foe at the same cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Bryce stepped into the arena, his eyes met a motionless Wooden Golem in the distance. It was made of a kind of wood he couldn't name, but it had a metallic sheen and looked rock-solid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox muttered, a tinge of uneasiness in his voice, "Hold on a sec... this Wooden Golem seems off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what's different about it? I can't quite put my finger on it, but it feels like someone's pulling the strings here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a soft laugh. "Don't sweat it! Let's just wait and see how things play out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also fixed his gaze on the Wooden Golem, his curiosity getting the better of him. He activated his Satan's Eye and took a peek inside the Golem. To his amazement, its internal mechanisms were incredibly elaborate, looking like something out of high-tech science.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, this is one well-made Golem!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Peak Lord Ms. Olsen of Peak Seven must be a real master forger! This Wooden Golem is definitely a top-notch Apex divine artifact!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was truly blown away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Grimoire of Sacred Artifact Forging also has methods for making Golems! Granted, it's about forging holy-level Golems, which would be even more complex and powerful than this one!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I've got to dig into that Grimoire of Sacred Artifact Forging as soon as I can!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As these thoughts whizzed through his head, he shifted his focus back to the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let the fight start!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, there was a soft hum, and the Wooden Golem sprang into action, gearing up for the battle.</span></p><div class="pagination">
