  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the first Intermediate Deity stepped out of the dimensional portal, a heavy silence fell over the members of the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear flickered in the eyes of many, a palpable tension gripping their hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While an Intermediate Deity might seem insignificant compared to the twenty-nine Transcendent Deity elders and the clan leader of the Deschanel Clan&mdash;each capable of taking down an Intermediate Deity with ease&mdash;the story shifted dramatically when their numbers began to swell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of the Intermediate Deity kept increasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of more and more Blood Demon warriors reaching Intermediate Deity status stirred panic among the Deschanel Clan ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Terrence and the other Transcendent Deity warriors stood dumbfounded, a mixture of apprehension and a hint of panic etching their expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surge of Intermediate Deity Blood Demon members continued, and as the last hundred Vanguard members launched from the dimensional portals, the atmosphere turned eerily quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The twenty portals flickered and vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A total of four thousand eight hundred ninety-six!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, four hundred fifty-six had attained Intermediate Deity status, while four thousand four hundred forty were mere Junior Deities!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Close to five thousand Blood Demon members gathered at Osborne's flanks, fully armed and eerily silent. Each warrior radiated confidence and resolve as if they were not individuals but a seamless, indomitable force&mdash;a spear poised to strike or a shield that would not yield!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the Blood Demon army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As their ranks augmented and their strength grew, their coordination became alarmingly precise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The aura they exuded converged into a terrifying force, pressing down on the Deschanel Clan like a mountain, making it hard for them to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The faces of most Deschanel Clan warriors turned ashen, fear evident in their wide eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five thousand divine beings loomed before them, four hundred fifty-six bearing the title of Intermediate Deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the laughter of Divine Shadow shattered the anxious silence, echoing ominously across the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every member of the Deschanel Clan turned to glare at her, their expressions darkening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfazed, Divine Shadow smirked. "What's the matter, Deschanel Clan? Suddenly gone mute? You were having a grand old time laughing just a moment ago!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why the long faces?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did someone die?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, keep laughing! Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the Deschanel Clan warriors lost in shock filled her with a sense of joy. Earlier, their mockery had stung, but now, witnessing their dismay brought her a measure of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Divine Shadow felt that the sheer number of close to five thousand Junior and Intermediate Deities might seem impressive, she knew it would hardly hold against the might of twenty-nine Transcendent Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, that didn't dampen her spirit in the slightest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence finally broke the tension with a cold scoff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nearly five thousand stepping into divinity! Over four hundred of them are even Intermediate Deity; I'll give you that&mdash;the Augustine family has certainly caught me off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But don't let it go to your head!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really think that this motley crew of Junior and Intermediate Deities can stand up to the Deschanel Clan? Dream on! Even a swarm of ants can't take down an elephant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne listened quietly, then smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? You make a compelling point. A horde of ants can never hope to topple an elephant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you're mistaken on one count&mdash;they are no ants, and you, well, you're no elephants either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Deschanel Clan must perish today! How dare you challenge the Augustine family? Not a single soul from the Deschanel Clan will leave here alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished, a frigid killing intent burst forth from Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of Blood Demon, standing behind him, mirrored his expression, their own auras icing over with terrifying intent. It hung heavy in the air, smothering the members of the Deschanel Clan in pure dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming pressure weighed down heavily on the Deschanel Clan, causing many of them to tremble, their lips turning white with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even before the battle had begun, they were already broken. Most of them, at least.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The few who had reached the ranks of Superior Deity or Transcendent Deity stood firm, but the rest quaked under the sheer power of Blood Demon's intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could they not?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing nearly five thousand Deities&mdash;Junior and Intermediate alike&mdash;was no small feat. The Deschanel Clan, after all, boasted only two hundred Deities in total. A twenty-five-fold difference in numbers. Even with twenty-nine Transcendent Deities, along with fifteen Superior Deity warriors, could they truly hold back such an overwhelming force?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, doubt gnawed at their resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence's face darkened because he could sense the crumbling confidence of his clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold snort, he stepped forward, his voice booming with defiance. "Think you can wipe out the Deschanel Clan? You're mistaken. In the Age of Gods, we stood among the most elite divine clans. Many have tried to destroy us, and all have failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Augustine family will be no different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five thousand ants? I'll slaughter them all right now and watch your family's hopes crumble into dust!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Terrence waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At his command, the twenty-nine Transcendent Deity warriors and the fifteen Superior Deity warriors of the Deschanel Clan sprang into action.</span></p><div class="pagination">
