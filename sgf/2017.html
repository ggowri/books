  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at his raised hand and smiled. "Don't worry, I won't use divine power or any other kind of power for this slap. It'll just be pure physical strength. If Mr. Cullen can't even handle that, then don't blame me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, you wouldn't go back on your word, would you? You'll honor the bet, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Julian and continued. "But, this bet was made in front of everyone here, including the God of Light. She's a witness too. If you refuse to honor it, I'll have no choice but to ask the God of Light to enforce it for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sure the God of Light, as the leader of the Human Community, will be fair and just."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time Osborne finished speaking, Julian's face had turned ashen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Osborne, his teeth clenched. "Osborne, are you really going to do this? Fine, I lost the bet, but I can offer something else in exchange!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled. "I already told you, there's nothing you have that I want. Keep your junk to yourself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All I want is to slap you once. Just to remind you that you're not as invincible as you think."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You...!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian was furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced around, hoping someone would step in and help him out of this situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But most people avoided his gaze, some even pretending nothing was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the God of Light remained calm and indifferent, showing no intention of intervening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I refused to honor the bet...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light would likely enforce it just as Osborne had said. Fairly and justly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Julian turned to Tanner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner, the head of the Jackson family and one of the top three Dukedom Level powers in the Human Community, was also an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words carried weight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of hesitation, Tanner said, "Osborne, do me a favor and let this go. Mr. Cullen meant no harm. Like the rest of us, he didn't expect your subordinates to be so strong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled while hearing his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Tanner and said, "You want me to let it go? If I had lost the bet and Julian demanded I pay up, would you have asked him to let it go? I didn't provoke him, yet he mocked me. Now that I've won, you're telling me to back off?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine. I won't slap Mr. Cullen... if you're willing to take the slap in his place. I have no problem with that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Osborne's expression turned cold and stern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tanner's expression darkened with anger, but after a moment of thought, he said nothing more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave Julian a helpless look and stepped back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked and looked at Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like no one's coming to your rescue. The next match is about to start, and I still need to participate. Mr. Cullen, let's not waste any more time. Take the slap, and we'll consider this matter settled."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's face twisted with conflicting emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew there was no way out of this. Osborne was relentless, and the God of Light would undoubtedly enforce the bet if he refused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting his teeth, Julian said, "Fine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just one slap. I, Julian, honor my bets! Come on! You said you wouldn't use divine power or any other power, and I won't use mine to defend myself either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get this over with!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian had made up his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was just one slap. Sure, it would be humiliating, but there would be no real damage. Osborne had promised not to use divine power or any other abilities, relying solely on physical strength. With Julian's powerful Divine Body,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could easily withstand it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once this was over, I'd find a way to get back at Osborne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled again. "Don't worry. I always keep my promises. No divine power, no other abilities. Just pure physical strength."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although my physical strength had already reached the level of Denary Dragon Might."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne didn't say this word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Anastasia, Zoe, and a few others who knew the extent of Osborne's physical power watched Julian with amusement, waiting for the show to begin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised his hand again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Cullen, I'm about to strike. Are you ready?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian snorted. "Just get on with it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, everyone thought Osborne was giving Julian an easy way out by promising not to use divine power or power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A "gentle" slap wouldn't cause any real harm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, Osborne swung his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't use his full strength. Not even close. He only used a tenth of his power, equivalent to...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Single Dragon Might!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Single Dragon Might was roughly equivalent to the full power of an Ascension Three Supernal Deity King using the Divine Ascendance Technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King like Julian, this level of power shouldn't be a big deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was one crucial detail: Julian couldn't use divine power or any other abilities to defend himself. He had to rely solely on his Divine Body and his face to withstand the Single Dragon Might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using his face to block Single Dragon Might?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Julian couldn't handle that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne's hand descended, Julian felt a sudden sense of unease. A bad premonition crept into his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he held firm, refusing to activate his divine power to defend himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's slap landed heavily on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's slap landed on Julian's face with devastating force. Julian's face twisted and deformed instantly, blood spraying everywhere. The Single Dragon Might erupted, completely disorienting him. His head was knocked sideways, his neck twisted, and the bones in his face groaned under the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a scream, Julian was sent flying, crashing heavily to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact of the slap was earth-shattering!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone, including the God of Light, was stunned. No one had expected Osborne's slap to be so powerful, or for Julian to be so thoroughly humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared in shock at Julian, who lay on the ground, his face covered in blood, his features distorted and out of place. Everyone couldn't help but swallow nervously, their faces filled with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian was an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Divine Body was supposed to be incredibly resilient. Yet, Osborne's slap had left him in such a state that he couldn't even recover immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that slap had landed on any of them...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their heads would probably have exploded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrifying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could anyone possess such immense physical strength?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone turned to Osborne, their faces filled with fear and wariness. Osborne was only an Ascension One Supernal Deity King, wasn't he?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the power of that slap...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was comparable to a full-force strike from an Ascension Three Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How was that possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the God of Light stared at Osborne in astonishment, her gaze lingering on his body with intense curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne offered no explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled and said, "Well, the bet's been settled. My issue with Mr. Cullen is now resolved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, it's time for me to head to the arena..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
