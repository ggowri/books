  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been holed up in that meeting for what felt like ages, repeatedly watching the four videos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each time, they scrutinized the strength of the Augustine family, debating the potential outcome if Rosmandi's Newport City were to face a Beast Tide of that magnitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The conclusions they reached weighed heavily on each of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truth was stark: they wouldn't stand a chance against such a Beast Tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it ever hit Rosmandi Newport City, it could easily end up in ruins, just like Yalynch's Lafier City, Marcelin's Harbino City, Ransford's Denferes City, and Easionand's Mayano City. The thought of millions falling victim to the Dark Deities sent shivers down their spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They brainstormed ways to fend off the impending disaster, but the consensus was grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless someone could break through to the divine realm and bring a divine warrior to protect Rosmandi Newport City, there was simply no way to withstand a Beast Tide of that scale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, breaking through to the divine realm wasn't something that happened overnight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forging Divine Bones, Divine Fleshes, and ultimately a Divine Body could take anywhere from a couple of months to several years&mdash;or even a lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And they just didn't have that kind of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why their anxiety was palpable, and their expressions grew increasingly grave before Osborne was back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, everything shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tension in the room began to ease with the news that Osborne had broken through to the divine realm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family finally had a true divine warrior in their ranks. Even if Newport City in Rosmandi were to face a Beast Tide led by a Dark Deity, they now had the strength to fight back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian exclaimed, clapping Osborne on the shoulder with enthusiasm, "Fantastic!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With you on our side, we finally have a fighting chance against the Dark Deities! We can stop worrying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others nodded in agreement, their spirits lifting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne couldn't help but chuckle, shaking his head. "Grandpa, you guys are overestimating me! Sure, I've become a deity, but there are levels to this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From what I know, there are seven tiers of deities, and the gap between each tier is massive. We've got Junior Deity, Intermediate Deity, Superior Deity, Transcendent Deity, Celestial Deity, Deity Overlord, and finally, Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right now, I'm just a Junior Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Dark Deities that wiped out Lafier City, Harbino City, and the others? They're at least Intermediate Deities, if not Superior Deities!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words hung in the air, and the room fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock and disbelief washed over their faces as they processed the implications.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seven tiers of deities? And the ones who destroyed those cities are at least Intermediate Deities?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weight of their situation settled back in, anxiety creeping back into their expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, his tone lightening, "But don't worry too much! In the short term, Newport City should be safe from any Beast Tide attacks. We're not likely to see a Dark Deity leading an army of Class S Dark Exotic Beasts anytime soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian raised an eyebrow, intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why do you say that? Are you sure? Remember, Lafier City and the others didn't see the Dark Deities coming until it was too late."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, a glimmer of confidence in his eyes, "Because I've already taken care of the Beast Tide in the Lostridge Mountains with the Blood Demon members. Plus, I found a subterranean rift near Eidolon City that led to a Dark Exotic Beast nest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Inside that nest, there was a Dark Deity and over 10 thousand Class S Dark Exotic Beasts&mdash;exactly the kind of threat we were worried about. But now? They're all gone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished speaking, Sebastian and the others were left in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you just say? You found a Dark Exotic Beast nest? You took out over ten thousand Class S Dark Exotic Beasts? And a Dark Deity?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, and after a long pause, Sebastian and the others finally began to settle down from their initial excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt to them like they had narrowly escaped disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suppose Osborne hadn't gone after the Beast Tide and discovered that Dark Exotic Beast nest; there was a good chance that in just a few days, the Dark Deity would have regained its Superior Deity powers. It could have led an army of over 10 thousand Class S Dark Exotic Beasts and more than 500 thousand evolved Ferocious Beasts straight to Newport City in Rosmandi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The city could easily have ended up in ruins, just like Lafier City in Yalynch, Harbino City in Marcelin, Denferes City in Ransford, and Mayano City in Easionand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, thanks to Osborne, the crisis had been averted!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne's expression remained grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, even though I've taken down the Dark Deity and destroyed the Dark Exotic Beast lair, we can't let our guard down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have no idea if there are any other Dark Deities lurking nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These Dark Deities survived the war in the Age of Gods, and no one knows how many of them are still out there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They will eventually regain their powers, and our situation will only become more perilous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need to think ahead and strengthen ourselves as quickly as possible. Otherwise, as more Dark Deities recover, it won't be long before we face annihilation!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
