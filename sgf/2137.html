  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Luminous Elven Wings enveloped Alfreda, absorbing the relentless barrage of attacks that rained down upon her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the warriors Uriel had brought were all at least Ascension Five level, and couldn't crack her defenses alone, their combined might, especially with Uriel leading the charge, began to weigh heavily on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thunderous crash, the wings started to splinter, and Alfreda was hurled backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Uriel and his team had no intention of letting her escape. They were set on her complete annihilation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uriel, you shameless coward!" Alfreda </span><span>seethed,</span><span> her fury ignited as she retaliated with everything she had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet the relentless pressure from Uriel and his allies only intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel laughed, reveling in his dominance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Princess Alfreda, history is written by the victors! Everyone here is loyal to me. Once I take you down, who's going to know what happened?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're strong, I'll give you that, but you're still going to die here. The mistake you made was coming to this place and witnessing the Umbra Earth continent's greatest secret&mdash;the Sacred Artifact-level palace!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, prepare to meet your end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With one final assault, amplified by five Ascension Six warriors and nearly a hundred Ascension Five warriors, Alfreda's Luminous Elven Wings shattered under the </span><span>combined force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, they had absorbed most of the attack's power, and her divine power shielded her from the worst of it. While she was pushed back and blood dripped from the corner of her mouth, the damage was manageable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda glared at </span><span>Uriel,</span><span> hands clenched in fury. "You bastard!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uriel, I wanted a fair fight, but you bring a whole army? Fine, then don't blame me for what comes next! Did you think you were the only one who could call for help?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to kill me? Dream on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda cast a desperate glance at Osborne hovering behind her. "Osborne, I can't hold them off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and nodded, saying, "Leave it to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped in front of Alfreda, facing Uriel and his minions' oncoming onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calmly, he addressed Uriel, "I think I overestimated you. I expected you to have some tricks up your sleeve to turn the tide. Instead, your big plan is just </span><span>to</span><span> swarm with numbers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A look of disdain creased Osborne's face, and Uriel's expression darkened as he realized Osborne was actually standing in their way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel said, disbelief etched in his voice, "You really think a worthless human at Ascension Three like you can save Princess Alfreda? What gave you the courage to face me?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're looking for a death wish, consider it granted!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll take you out first, then finish off Alfreda. There'll be no one left to hinder my claim to the Sacred Artifact-level Palace!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce shout, Uriel unleashed a brilliant beam of light aimed straight at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confidence radiated from him; he perceived Osborne as nothing more than an easy target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This attack might not have shattered Alfreda's wings, but he believed no Ascension Six would walk away unscathed from it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Osborne? He was just </span><span>an </span><span>Ascension Three Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's Luminous Elven Wings had already been shattered. Uriel was confident that his attack could easily kill Osborne and even severely wound Alfreda in the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the attack hurtled toward them, Uriel noticed an odd tranquility on both Osborne and Alfreda's faces, as if they had anticipated this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eclipse War Armor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne sprang into action. A magnificent energy armor enveloped him, transforming him into a figure of power and resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing boldly in front of Alfreda, he didn't budge an inch as Uriel's attack closed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a blinding flash, Uriel's assault exploded against Osborne's armor, a dazzling burst of light that illuminated the battlefield, engulfing both him and Alfreda within its brilliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is he dead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel frowned, staring at Osborne, who had taken the full brunt of his attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A nagging unease crept into his mind. Osborne was far too calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why isn't he dodging? Is he just looking for a death wish?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon enough, the truth became clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the blinding light faded, Osborne stood unscathed, his armor gleaming with a regal purple-black glow, not a hair out of place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel's jaw dropped in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible? A worthless human at Ascension Three can't just brush off my attack like that! Even Princess Alfreda, with her Luminous Elven Wings, wouldn't be able to withstand my power so easily!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression twisted into one of confusion and frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne simply smiled, too uninterested to explain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Eclipse War Armor was forged from his own Sacred Power, boasting defensive capabilities that rivaled, if not surpassed, Alfreda's wings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel, despite being Ascension Seven, didn't have the strength to breach it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said with a hint of amusement, "Uriel, you might as well save your breath. Your strength is inferior to my little sidekick. Why not attack together? You might actually give me a bit of entertainment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel's shock was palpable. "What do you mean by that?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda </span><span>scoffed,</span><span> her disdain evident. "Uriel, are you really that thick? You still don't get it? Osborne is my boss! His power surpasses mine! If you can't even beat me, what makes you think you can take him on? My advice? Run while you still can, or it'll be too late!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel stared at both Alfreda and Osborne, incredulous. "Run?! You think this Ascension Three guy is stronger than you?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want me to flee? Hahaha! Princess Alfreda, do you take me for a fool? He merely used some trick to block my attack once. I can still kill him with ease!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda rolled her eyes, unimpressed. "If that's the case, why don't you give it a shot and find out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel's face darkened. "Fine! I'll show you!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I refuse to believe a mere Ascension Three can withstand me! Not even a genius from the Sacred Dragon Clan could stand against my might! Today, I will eliminate both of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he locked his gaze on Osborne, his expression steely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Human, I don't know how you blocked my attack before, but you won't be so lucky this time! Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel transformed into a blinding beam of light, charging at Osborne like a miniature sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Uriel's signature move!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had used it earlier to break through Alfreda's defenses, and now he aimed to obliterate both her and Osborne in one fell swoop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, despite the impending onslaught, Osborne remained calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had observed Uriel's strength during the fight with Alfreda and had a solid grasp of what he was up against.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This attack was powerful, but he was even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial Oblivion Slash!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
