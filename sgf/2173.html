  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Maddox finally made his move, his energy signature could no longer be concealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's eyes widened as she confirmed his cultivation level: Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that crucial moment, not only did Emma's expression shift dramatically, but Clarissa, Austin, the God of Time, and the others also felt the weight of the revelation. They stared at Maddox, their faces etched with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ascension Nine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a level reserved for the likes of the God of Night and Lord Malevolence&mdash;the pinnacle of warriors that Celestara Planet had ever seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, in Celestara Planet, only the God of Night had ever reached Ascension Nine; no one else had even touched Ascension Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the God of Light, God of Death, Goddess of Life, God of Time, Goddess of Fate, and God of Space were all hailed as the Seven Great Deity Kings of the Human Community, their peak cultivation levels had only ever reached Ascension Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even now, they were merely back to their former strength&mdash;still stuck at Ascension Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with Maddox's Ascension Nine level, how could they not be shaken?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was another super warrior on par with Lord Malevolence from a thousand years ago!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, although Lord Malevolence had been defeated and sealed by their combined efforts, he had still managed to kill the Goddess of Life and the Goddess of Fate, severely injuring the God of Death, God of Time, and God of Space&mdash;so badly that they had to enter the cycle of reincarnation to heal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Night and the God of Light had also been gravely wounded, stalling their cultivation for centuries, even causing regression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear just how powerful Lord Malevolence had been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as Maddox showcased his strength, he mirrored that very same power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa and the others couldn't help but recall the brutal battles of the past, their faces paling at the memories of the devastating outcomes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thousand years ago, they had the God of Night leading the charge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now? The God of Night was still absent, and they were left to fend for themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did they really have what it took to stand against Maddox?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, uncertainty loomed over them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox chuckled, his demeanor relaxed, "Ascension Nine is nothing to fuss over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In Racial Convergence Planet, it's just the beginning. Only when you become an Empyrean Sacredness warrior can you truly call yourself a powerhouse! You Celestara Planet natives really are just frogs in a well!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I can offer you a chance! If you're willing to surrender, I'll recommend you to the elders of the Mystic Sirius Sect. You all have impressive talent, and I can help you join our ranks!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Joining the Mystic Sirius Sect means you'll gain access to a wealth of cultivation resources&mdash;resources you'll never find in this barren Celestara Planet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With your talent and those resources, you'll skyrocket in power, quickly becoming inner disciples of the Mystic Sirius Sect, or even core members! In the future, you might even become Empyrean Sacredness warriors, the backbone of the Mystic Sirius Sect!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So think it over! I'm offering you this opportunity because I value talent. Don't be foolish and turn it down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Maddox laid out his proposal, Emma and Clarissa exchanged glances, their expressions darkening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma retorted, her voice steady and fierce, "You think we'll just roll over and surrender?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dream on! So what if you're an Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King? A thousand years ago, we took down Lord Malevolence, who was also Ascension Nine. We're stronger now than we were back then, and we can take you down too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who cares about your Mystic Sirius Sect? We're not interested!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a determined nod from Clarissa, Emma's voice rose, filled with resolve. "Even if you are Ascension Nine, today, we will defeat you! Let's fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma shouted, determination blazing in her eyes as she launched her next attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Death Ripple!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a low hum, the eerie white eye began to vibrate violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waves of invisible energy erupted from it, rapidly spreading toward Maddox. Wherever the ripples passed, the fabric of space shattered, everything around them tainted by a terrifying aura of death, decaying in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox scoffed, his expression darkening, "You ungrateful woman! You've missed a golden opportunity to change your fate! Since you've chosen this path, I won't hold back any longer! You dare to strike at me, an Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King? Do you really think I can't handle you if I don't retaliate?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost!" Maddox bellowed, his hand plunging into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deafening thunderclap erupted, but there was no flash of lightning&mdash;only the sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Strangely, the death ripples emanating from Emma's Death's Stare suddenly halted in midair, flickering with electric energy before hurtling back toward her with alarming speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's face paled in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't anticipated such a turn of events, and by the time she realized what was happening, it was too late to defend or evade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a stunning figure stepped in front of her&mdash;Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fate's Destination!" Clarissa declared, raising her delicate hand and pressing it against the void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strange power coursed into the air around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Incredibly, the electric Death Ripples that had been hurtling back toward Emma shifted direction once more, now racing back toward Maddox.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox's eyes widened in surprise. "Huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He regarded Clarissa, his brow furrowing slightly. "Fate power? Such a peculiar force! You're only at Ascension Seven level, yet you can redirect my attack? Impressive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad it won't harm me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Maddox unleashed a powerful palm strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a flash of lightning erupted, and the electrified Death Ripples were obliterated in the air, as if they had never existed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma and Clarissa exchanged glances, their expressions darkening with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What overwhelming power!" Emma whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox smirked, "This is getting fun! Two Ascension Seven chicks actually make me use 30% of my power? That's no small feat! But you are still way out of your league. I've got no more time to waste on you two. Get ready to eat dirt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a chilling finality, Maddox struck again, summoning countless bolts of lightning from the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They coalesced into a massive electric hand that descended upon Emma and Clarissa. The terrifying lightning hand was upon them in an instant. Gritting their teeth, they braced for impact, but the next moment, they were struck hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of them were sent flying, and their defenses shattered. The searing power of the lightning scorched their bodies, inflicting heavy wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, a vibrant green light surged through the air, enveloping them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Austin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Clarissa and Emma were injured, Austin channeled a vast well of vitality into them, swiftly mending their grievous wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, Emma and Clarissa's faces remained grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox was just too powerful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with Austin's support, they struggled to see how they could stand against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What do we do now?!</span></p><div class="pagination">
