  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the sixth layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm, only the top twenty on the power rankings could keep their cool. They pulled out their Sacred Artifacts and, with their might, managed to stand firm in the sixth layer, warding off the attacks of that terrifying storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the ones trailing behind, even with the help of Sacred Artifacts, it was an uphill battle to resist the sixth-layer storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there were distinctions among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top fifty seemed to have </span><span>the</span><span> power</span><span> to stay</span><span>. They could tough it out for a good while, at least a few hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top eighty could last for about an hour. And the top hundred could hold on for a bit, at least.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only those ranked after the hundredth spot were really struggling. Their defenses would crumble in no time. If Rupert didn't step in to protect them in the nick of time, they'd surely get hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave was in this very pickle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was ranked 108th on the power rankings. He had no desire to be a show-off and didn't want anyone to catch on that he could handle the sixth-layer storm with relative ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he put on an act of being on the verge of giving in and voluntarily let his Sacred Power defense fizzle out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the state duel hadn't kicked off officially yet, so there was no point in showing his hand just now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Conrad caught sight of Osborne's predicament, he immediately sneered in disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said casually, "How ridiculous! People ranked after the hundredth spot have the nerve to come to the sixth layer? If I'd known the state duel was gonna be held in the Arctic Maw Chasm, I'd never have asked you to join my team!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>After all</span><span>, my team's gonna be scouring the fifth layer, or maybe even the sixth layer, for tokens for a long time. And you, someone ranked after the hundredth, can't even hang around in the fifth layer for long, yet you're here in the sixth? That's a real knee-slapper!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pathetic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad's jibes made the faces of those ranked after the hundredth turn a bit sour. He wasn't just taking a dig at Osborne; he was dissing all of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they didn't dare to utter a peep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, in the Arctic Maw Chasm, the brutal environment laid bare the vast gulf in their strengths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an open-and-shut case; one could tell at a glance who was packing some heat and who wasn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strong could venture deeper into the chasm, while the weak could barely hold their ground in such a harsh setting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne paid Conrad no heed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just some cheap talk. It didn't cost him a thing, so he let Conrad run his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Conrad wasn't about to let Osborne off the hook.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He jeered, "What's wrong? Lost your voice? Osborne, didn't you say you wanted to have a go at me before? How about we set this duel right here in the sixth layer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't have the guts, do you? Haha, if that's the way it is, then apologize, and plead for my forgiveness. Maybe I'll cut you some slack."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a look of utter disdain spread across Conrad's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne retorted coolly, "Set the duel in the sixth layer? You sure about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad was taken aback for a second, then let out a sneering laugh. "What's there to be unsure of?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile. "In the sixth layer, your odds of winning are even slimmer. After all, your teammates can't last long here. If we fight right here, they'll be in even more hot water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, if we duel here, you won't have any backup."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Conrad burst out laughing. "So what? At least they can hang around in the sixth layer for a bit. But you? As soon as you step foot in the sixth layer, I won't even have to lift a finger. The hellish storm here will finish you off in no time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a soft chuckle. "Is that so?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then the sixth layer it is! Let's make it the third day of the state duel! Before the first stage wraps up, what do you say? We'll sort this out right here by this Translocator. Anybody who doesn't show up is a yellow-bellied coward!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne locked eyes with Conrad, his gaze full of challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd picked the third day because by then, the first stage of the token-hunting would be almost over, and Conrad would surely have racked up a ton of points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beating Conrad at that moment would score Osborne a tenth of those points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not too shabby a deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad scoffed dismissively. "Works for me! If you're that dead-set on getting yourself killed, I'm more than happy to help. If you don't show your face here on the third day of the state duel, you'll grovel in front of everyone, call yourself a good-for-nothing, and admit you're my lapdog!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, his expression nonchalant. "Same goes for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the time and place of their showdown decided, they turned their backs on each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, a lot of people were eyeing Osborne with confused looks on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne can't even hold his own in the sixth layer. He needs Mr. Carroll to watch his back and keep him out of harm's way. So, why on earth is he challenging Conrad to a duel here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Has he gone off the deep end?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It's a lost cause!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Just like Conrad said, Conrad won't even have to throw a punch. That crazy storm in the sixth layer will wipe Osborne out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What a waste of time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Plain suicide, if you ask me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The gap in their strength is just too wide. This fight's a complete non-starter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were the thoughts swirling around in the heads of many onlookers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the distance, Leroy was having a hard time keeping herself upright. She was looking at Osborne with worry in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tried to speak up several times, but the guy next to her kept shutting her down. "Stay out of it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man said in a cold, composed tone, "Conrad's not someone we can mess with! Don't stick your neck out for a guy who's just asking for trouble. Otherwise, you'll drag our whole team into the mud and screw up my plan to make it into the top ten!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy wavered for ages, but in the end, she could only give a nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rupert spoke up, his voice oozing authority, "Alright, folks! You've all seen what the sixth layer's like. I'm sure after experiencing it for yourselves, you've got a pretty good idea of just how brutal the environment is!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, in the upcoming state duel, you'd better size up your own skills before you decide which layer to go for and start hunting for tokens. If you can't hack it in this tough environment and need a judge to come to your rescue, you're out on the spot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I'm gonna get you all out of here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The state duel kicks off tomorrow morning! I wish you all the best and hope you achieve what you're aiming for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Rupert turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, a sweet-sounding voice chimed in, "Mr. Carroll, can we head into the seventh layer?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, everyone's eyes darted towards the speaker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Agatha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rupert looked at Agatha, surprise etched on his face and his brows knitted together. "Agatha, I wouldn't recommend that. Even a bunch of Empyrean Sacredness warriors can't keep themselves safe in the seventh layer. And besides, there aren't any state-duel tokens in the seventh layer. It's a dead end if you ask me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha gave a faint smile. "But I've heard that in the Arctic Maw Chasm, starting from the seventh layer down, there's this super-precious cultivation resource called Frost-kissed Heart!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Frost-kissed Heart can not only beef up your physical body but also make it a breeze to meld with power. Even for Empyrean Sacredness warriors, Frost-kissed Heart is worth its weight in gold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm really keen on getting my hands on the Frost-kissed Heart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she finished speaking, Rupert's frown deepened. "There's really Frost-kissed Heart in the Arctic Maw Chasm, starting from the seventh layer on down! But it's rarer than hen's teeth. It's no walk in the park to find it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just the fact that it's there is good enough for me!" Agatha said, gave a slight nod, and then kept her lips zipped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rupert furrowed his brow, and finally said, "Anyway, I still think you shouldn't go into the seventh layer. You might end up biting the dust in there. Come on! Let's get out of here!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
