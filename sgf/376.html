  <div class="container"><p>Osborne sensed the fluctuation after Isaac finished speaking.</p><p>The battle with Brad did not last long, only a few minutes.</p><p>But damn, that power surge was off the charts. Every badass within miles felt it and was bound to come sniffing.</p><p>The Augustine family wasn&#x27;t the only one in the surrounding sea. The Marions and Walkers were here too.</p><p>Osborne activated his Satan&#x27;s Eye, scoping out the Marions and Walkers. He saw many strong men rushing out and approaching over quickly.</p><p>Even some Augustines caught wind and were rushing over.</p><p>Osborne&#x27;s face went sour.</p><p>No way he wanted to go full-on war with the Paltrows. The Augustines didn&#x27;t have the juice to take them on, so he couldn&#x27;t let anyone know he&#x27;d killed Brad.</p><p>&quot;Let&#x27;s go.&quot; Osborne did not hesitate.</p><p>He waved his hand to lift Brad&#x27;s withered body and put it into the Dimensional Space.</p><p>Then, he opened a dimensional rift, grabbed Isaac&#x27;s shoulder, and entered the void. </p><p>Soon, they&#x27;re back at Augustine HQ.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne sucked all Brad&#x27;s life force and energy. His death was too strange. If others saw his body, it would be bad for Osborne. Moreover, hiding Brad&#x27;s body could affect the Paltrow family&#x27;s judgment.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Not long after Osborne and Isaac left, the fastest master of the Walker family arrived.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was a middle-aged man.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He was surprised, looking at the empty sea, which just had a fierce battle. He couldn&#x27;t help but frown.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He murmured, &quot;It&#x27;s weird. There was a fierce battle between at least two Class A martial artists. Why did they disappear so quickly?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Where did they go?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The next second, several masters arrived.</p><p style="text-align:left;">They were masters from the Walker, Marion, and Augustine families. They looked around the sea in surprise.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The leader of the Walker family&#x27;s masters was the middle-aged man who had just arrived first.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He was Shawn Walker, the head of the Walker family and a Class A mind control Power Master.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The leading man of the Marion family was an older man. He was Emery Marion, the eldest master of the family. He could control water elemental. Emery was the only Power Master and the strongest person in the Marion family.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The leader of the Augustine family was Brian Augustine, the head of the family.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Brian was not a Class A Power Master, so he seemed to be less imposing in front of Emery and Shawn.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mr. Walker, what happened?&quot; Emery looked at Shawn and asked. After all, Shawn was the first to arrive.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Shawn shook his head. &quot;I don&#x27;t know. When I got here, the battle was over, and there was no one around. Look! There are bodies!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Upon hearing this, everyone looked over.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The cleft bodies of Yohan and Lauren were floating on the sea, drifting with the waves, with fear on their faces.</p><p style="text-align:left;">When everyone saw the thunder symbol on Yohan and Lauren&#x27;s clothes, their expressions suddenly changed.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;The symbol on their clothes is the family emblem of the Paltrow family!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;They are probably the Paltrows!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;How could they die here?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Shawn and Emery&#x27;s expressions turned solemn.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Brian looked a little pale. He hesitated for a moment and finally said, &quot;They are indeed from the Paltrow family. I know them. They are Yohan and Lauren. Not long ago, they followed Brad to the Augustine Estate to discuss some affairs.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;And just over ten minutes ago, they left. Unexpectedly, they died here! Where is Brad? Why is he not here?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Shawn and Emery were both shocked when they heard this.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But they didn&#x27;t say anything.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Shawn hesitated for a moment and then said, &quot;Notify the Paltrow family.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Just now, I felt two powerful fight fluctuations here. One of which is probably Brad&#x27;s. Two young people from the Paltrow family have died, and Brad has disappeared. Something might have happened.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Leave this matter to the Paltrow family.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">After Shawn finished speaking, he contacted someone from the Paltrow family.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne wheeled Isaac out of the conference hall. He glanced around casually and remembered all the people there.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Isaac, something happened!&quot; When Nathan saw them coming out, he immediately ran over and said with a severe expression.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Isaac knew what it was, but he remained calm and asked in confusion, &quot;What happened?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Nathan quickly reported.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Isaac pretended to be surprised. &quot;How could such a thing happen? I&#x27;ll go over and take a look. Don&#x27;t be panic. Although they just left here, we didn&#x27;t do anything to them. The Paltrow family won&#x27;t blame us.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">After saying this, Isaac and Osborne left the Augustine Estate.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The surrounding people glanced at each other, looking solemn and worried.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Something happened to Brad and his companions just after they left the Augustine Estate.</p><p><em>Would the Paltrow family really not hold the Augustine family accountable?</em></p><p style="text-align:left;">Everyone was worried.</p><p style="text-align:left;">A person in the darkness had a puzzled look, but it quickly disappeared.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne and Isaac returned to the sea where the accident happened.</p><div class="pagination">
