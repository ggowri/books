  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew he had to be resolute to firmly draw the line between himself and Ophelia once and for all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wrestled internally with the thought, "I can't possibly forgive Ophelia!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No simple apology can mend the wounds she has inflicted on me! Signing that bloody divorce agreement was my way of closing that chapter. There's no going back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's voice screeched through the air, but Osborne remained fixated on the five bodies before him, hardly sparing her a glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His silence ignited a spark of fury in her&mdash;the rage turned into madness, then into hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "Why is Osborne being so cold toward me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've apologized, I've humbled myself, and I've been begging for forgiveness, yet he still refuses to accept it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can't accept it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enormity of that thought was too much for her to bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia trembled violently, an overwhelming force bubbling up within her as she murmured to herself, as if seeking the answer deep inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you doing this to me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've apologized! I know I was wrong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why won't you forgive me? Why are you still so distant?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, her voice rose into a furious roar, and the air around Ophelia crackled with an intensity that shook the very room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the five divine bodies trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Powerful energy surged from Ophelia, a force that far exceeded what a Class AAA could harness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned to her, his expression one of shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What on earth is happening? Is she breaking through to Class S?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The commotion she was causing was unprecedented, completely unlike any typical breakthrough he'd ever witnessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And her emotional state was way out of control!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this continued, her breakthrough could very well end in disaster!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ophelia, you need to calm down! You're on the verge of breaking into Class S, but you must steady yourself, or the process will fail!" he implored urgently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay out of it!" Ophelia screamed, her red eyes locked onto him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air around her crackled with energy, her clothes whipping wildly, her hair swirling as she floated, looking down at him with pure fury and hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is none of your business!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, Ophelia was oblivious to the chaotic power rampaging through her; she was merely venting the torrent of rage and bitterness inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why should I abase myself begging for his forgiveness only to be met with this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why, despite all my achievements, won't he even look at me? I can't accept this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt a chasm opening up within her, a void pulsing with boundless energy that sought to engulf her, pulling her deeper into its depths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't fight it. Ophelia embraced that power, welcoming the plunge into the abyss!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ophelia, please, calm down!" Osborne shouted again, witnessing how dangerously far gone she had become.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Ophelia laughed, a chilling sound that sent shivers down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I swear! One day, you'll regret this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One day, you'll come to see what you lost by refusing my apologies! Just you wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's brow furrowed tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ophelia, this isn't the right mindset for a breakthrough. You really need to take a step back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he readied himself for action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He intended to knock Ophelia out&mdash;just temporarily&mdash;to let her regain her calm before moving forward with the breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Osborne approached Ophelia, a terrifying force erupted from her, blasting him backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its sheer power was even stronger than Gerardo's full might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face paled, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth as he stared in shock at Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of abnormality about her breakthrough resurfaced in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia simply smiled, her eyes locking onto Osborne for one last profound gaze before she closed them, two crimson tears rolling down her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, her energy exploded wildly, causing the entire lair of the Aberrants to shake violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force rippling from her was so intense that Osborne could only stagger back, his face awash with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even more astonishing was the sight of the five divine corpses, which disintegrated into beams of light, swiftly merging into Ophelia's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A formidable, sacred power then emanated from her, leaving Osborne utterly speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This... is..." Osborne stammered, his heart racing as he sensed the divine energy coursing through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine power?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force surging within Ophelia was unmistakably divine&mdash;pure, raw divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, abruptly, Osborne felt a violent throbbing in his left eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Satan's Eye seemed on the brink of a breakthrough.</span></p><div class="pagination">
