Greyson </span><span>murmured,</span><span> his voice laced with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roy nodded in agreement, his expression mirroring Greyson's astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked at Osborne as if he were a monster, a young man barely twenty-five years old yet wielding power that seemed beyond comprehension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was still just a Class AAA!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't fathom how formidable he would become once he broke through to Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps he would be able to face off against the </span><span>top Class</span><span> S fighters on the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One thing was certain: Osborne's attack power would be nothing short of extraordinary!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne was contemplating how to test the defensive capabilities of his martial art aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he stood beside Greyson and Roy, a cold smile appearing on his face as he focused on the two terrified Class S </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> assassins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Greyson Lambert, Sir Lambert, leave these two to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two exchanged glances, silently agreeing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had already gained the upper hand, and while they were </span><span>confident</span><span> they could defeat the two Class S assassins, it would take considerable time and likely result in injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Osborne was stepping in, they wouldn't contest his decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With an air of calm confidence, Osborne began to stride toward the two Class S assassins, who were now visibly shaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, are you really willing to make an enemy of the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization? I strongly advise you to back off. We serve Sin and Crimson; if you dare to kill us, they will not let you get away with it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned scornful at their words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've already killed their daughter. Do you really think I'm afraid of taking out a couple of their underlings? Ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two assassins exchanged a glance, determination flashing in their eyes as they prepared for what was to come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, we're not going down without a fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to kill us, you'll pay the price!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, they launched their attacks. Having witnessed Osborne's brutal efficiency in dispatching their comrade, they knew that defense alone wouldn't cut it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had to go on the offensive&mdash;fierce, relentless attacks were their only hope of buying time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could only hope Osborne's defenses weren't as insane as his attacks!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their lives on the line, they poured everything they had into their assault, unleashing their most powerful techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out, Godfather!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of the way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greyson and Roy shouted warnings to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To them, he was still just a Class AAA, and while his offensive capabilities were mind-boggling, there was no way his defenses could match up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two Class S assassins were clearly going all out, and even Greyson and Roy felt the weight of their power. They believed Osborne must dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne had other plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was determined to test the limits of his martial art aura's defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing his ground, he enveloped himself in the dark red aura, which now resembled a suit of armor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see how strong this really is," Osborne muttered to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the two assassins launched their attacks at Osborne, striking against his martial art aura defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying force erupted in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the ultimate move of two Class S </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization assassins, a full-powered strike that even someone like Greyson or Roy would have to avoid or risk getting hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne simply absorbed it with his martial art aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming force caused the aura to vibrate violently, but it didn't shatter. Osborne staggered back two steps, a slight pallor crossing his face, but he fully withstood their attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Remarkably, his body showed no signs of injury whatsoever!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight left the two Class S </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization assassins dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far away, Greyson and Roy were equally stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been bracing themselves to rush in and save Osborne. Yet here he was, effortlessly blocking the attack without even a scratch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even his martial art aura had broken!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two sucked in a sharp breath, suddenly feeling like they had wasted decades of their lives. If Osborne could withstand the full force of two Class S </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization assassins' most powerful attacks, then he could certainly handle whatever they threw at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that if they didn't employ some special methods, they would likely struggle to break through Osborne's defenses!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is insane!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
