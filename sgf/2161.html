  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the arrival of God of Time, cheers erupted from the Human Alliance once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the death of the God of Light, the Human Community desperately needed a pillar of strength, and God of Time's effortless dispatch of Samson had reignited their hope. It was as if they had found their backbone, and their morale surged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Time listened to the jubilant cries, a satisfied smile creeping across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She declared, "Good! Stay here for now and watch as I take down the Dark Sovereigns of the Paramount Supreme Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a menacing glint flashed in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, she vanished from sight. When the crowd finally registered what had happened, a colossal projection of divine power materialized in the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was God of Time herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze locked onto the Ninefold Heaven's Tower, and a mocking smile spread across her face. "Icy One! You think you can gang up on the God of Light? What a pathetic show! The God of Light was gravely injured by Lord Malevolence a thousand years ago, and her essence has been compromised ever since. If you're so bold, come face me in battle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am the God of Time, reborn from the cycle of life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice thundered, reaching every corner of the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Deity Legion, locked in their siege against Peaks City, was thrown into a frenzy at her words. Many of them stumbled backward in fear, recognizing the name that once sent shivers down their spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the Seven Great Deity Kings of the Human Community, God of Night was the most well-rounded and powerful, but God of Time was the most enigmatic and bloodthirsty&mdash;her reputation was legendary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the depths of the Ninefold Heaven's Tower, Icy One and Icy Two emerged, their faces grim as they regarded the God of Time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One gritted his teeth. "God of Time! I can't believe you managed to return from the cycle! In just a thousand years, not only have you come back, but your powers are fully restored!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad it's no longer your era! Even if you've returned, what can you change? The Human Community is doomed! The esteemed Lord Malevolence has decreed the complete eradication of the Human Community on Celestara Planet and the reconstruction of the Malevolence Empire!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't think that your return, or even the return of the God of Space, God of Life, God of Death, and the Goddess of Fate, along with the God of Night and God of Light, could alter the inevitable downfall of the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're wise, you'll get out of Celestara Planet while you still can. With your power, you could thrive in this cosmos without throwing your life away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One finished, his tone dripping with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Time merely laughed, a sound laced with contempt. "Icy One, you talk too much! You think I'm afraid? Afraid of being taken down by you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's anger flared. "God of Time, you're incredibly arrogant! Sure, your time powers are tricky, but thinking you can kill us is just a pipe dream!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Time's icy smile returned. "Is that so? If your Ninefold Heaven's Tower were still intact, I would indeed find it difficult to kill you. "As long as you hide within its walls, you'd have a fighting chance... but how foolish of you to destroy it in your attempt to eliminate the God of Light!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, the Ninefold Heaven's Tower has significantly weakened, hasn't it? It can't protect you from me anymore! I'm giving you a chance&mdash;retreat six million miles with the Dark Deity Legion, and I won't lay a finger on you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, this war between the Paramount Supreme Clan and the Human Community isn't something you or I can decide. The ultimate outcome will be determined by the God of Night and Lord Malevolence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't come here to kill; I'm just waiting for the God of Night to make his move... So, take your Dark Deity Legion and get lost! If you do, I won't kill you. But if you refuse, don't blame me for being ruthless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As her words hung in the air, Icy One and his companions exchanged glances, their expressions hardening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want me to lead the Dark Deity Legion back six million miles? In your dreams! That's no different from asking us to surrender! God of Time, don't try to intimidate me&mdash;just because you've come back doesn't mean you can take us down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want a fight, then let's fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's voice dripped with defiance, his aura crackling with battle intent as he glared at God of Time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Time simply smiled, "Oh, is that how it is?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let's get to it! If you're looking for death, I'll be happy to oblige! Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could follow her movements; one moment she was there, and the next, Icy One was sent flying, crashing into the ground with a tremendous impact that created a massive crater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His companions&mdash;Icy Two, Icy Three, Icy Four, and Icy Five&mdash;were left stunned, unable to react in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they turned to see God of Time, she regarded the spot where Icy One had landed with a look of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes met hers, and a wave of realization washed over them&mdash;God of Time was stronger than ever!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were no match for her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a battered Icy One emerged from the crater, fury boiling in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Time, you coward! You attacked me without warning!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Time chuckled, a smirk appearing on her face. "A sneak attack? You think you're worthy of that? Just so you know, I'm about to strike again, and I'll be aiming for your chest!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm coming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before anyone could react, Icy One felt a crushing blow to his chest, sending him hurtling backward once more, blood spraying from his mouth as he crashed into the ground, creating an even larger crater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Time asked casually, "How's that? Still think I'm sneaking up on you? "I told you exactly how I'd attack, and you still couldn't dodge or defend yourself! You're pathetic, thinking you can be arrogant in front of me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll send your own words back to you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This isn't your era anymore! You've lost your edge&mdash;don't embarrass yourselves in front of me! I'll give you one last chance&mdash;retreat six million miles with your Dark Deity Legion, or I will wipe you out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cold, murderous tone sent shockwaves through the crowd. Everyone stared at her in disbelief, their faces pale with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Terrifying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even Icy One stands no chance against God of Time! She's stronger than she was a thousand years ago! The entire Paramount Supreme Clan is likely no match for her, except maybe for Lord Malevolence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the Dark Deity Legion trembled in fear, the Human Alliance erupted in cheers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Time's might invigorated them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Icy One get beaten without even a chance to retaliate made it clear&mdash;God of Time was far stronger than the God of Light!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Anastasia and Zoe wore grave expressions, their faces pale with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's voice trembled. "She's become so powerful! Anastasia, is she really an enemy of Osborne? Does she truly want to kill him? If Osborne returns, will he be able to stand against her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia bit her lip, shaking her head. "I don't know! But I believe in Osborne! He's never let me down before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And I can feel it! Osborne will be back soon!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
