  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment the arrow was released, Osborne himself was startled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he saw the arrow directly pierce through the Beast Clan warrior's head, Osborne was completely stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Was this really my attack?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Can my attack be this powerful?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, when he used the Bloodwrought Bow to fully unleash the Heaven Arrow, he couldn't even break through the defense of these astral projections.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So when encountering the astral projections of the Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, Osborne could only avoid them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, using the Apocalypse Bow to unleash the same Heaven Arrow with the same power, he easily blasted their heads!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although those astral projections were already gravely injured and barely had any defense left, the power was still astonishing!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The power of this arrow was at least dozens, if not hundreds, of times greater than when he used the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is terrifying!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked down at the Apocalypse Bow in his hand. At this moment, the Apocalypse Bow seemed to have lost its power, and Osborne could no longer draw it or use it in battle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Apocalypse Bow was too damaged; overuse would accelerate its collapse. Unless Osborne could repair it better, he could only use it once a day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And he couldn't exploit loopholes with time acceleration.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Apocalypse Bow doesn't fall for that!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Before, I thought shooting only one arrow a day was useless, almost no improvement for me! But now I know, I was wrong, terribly wrong!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This will become my new trump card!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I use the Apocalypse Bow with my current strength and unleash the Heaven Arrow with full force, the power of this shot can definitely threaten the defenses of those Imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even Frederick would probably be seriously injured if hit by this arrow!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was extremely excited at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What excited him even more was that after killing that astral projection, a massive power surged into his body. He was already close to Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, and with the help of this power, his cultivation level directly broke through from Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection to Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I did it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A sense of joy spread throughout Osborne's body again, with every cell cheering.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had finally reached Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Killing an astral projection at the Imperial Empyrean Sacredness level provides power equivalent to killing ten thousand astral projections at the Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness level! Maybe even more..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was incredibly excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although the Apocalypse Bow can only shoot one arrow a day, successfully killing an astral projection at the Imperial Empyrean Sacredness level is equivalent to killing ten thousand astral projections at the Proto-Imperial Empyrean Sacredness level...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My cultivation level will improve even faster than before!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If the Skyfall Casket closes a bit later, I might even break through to become a Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness right here!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was incredibly excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After reaching Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, his strength skyrocketed once again. Defeating Hendrix was now a piece of cake, even if Hendrix broke through to Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Osborne previously had no trouble dealing with Common Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, there was still a significant gap between him and Adriana. Even if he used all his means, he probably wouldn't be a match for a Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Facing Frederick, the gap was even greater!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Osborne had broken through to Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection. He felt that with his current cultivation level, he was no longer inferior even against opponents like Adriana!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He even had the qualifications to face Frederick head-on.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, he could be said to stand at the pinnacle of Racial Convergence Planet. Except for those three Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean warriors, he feared no one!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Great!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Speaking of which, I really have to thank Frederick. If he hadn't brought me to Necropolis City, I wouldn't have reached my current cultivation level! At most, I would still be at advanced Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Advanced Empyrean Sacredness and Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection are worlds apart! If relying solely on normal cultivation without other opportunities for advancement, it would take me at least hundreds of years to break through!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;&#21363;&#20415;&#25105;&#30340;&#22825;&#36171;&#20877;&#22909;&#65292;&#24656;&#24597;&#20063;&#35201;&#20960;&#21313;&#24180;&#65281;&#32780;&#20174;&#36827;&#20837;Black Whirlpool&#65292;&#25269;&#36798;Necropolis City&#21040;&#29616;&#22312;&#20063;&#19981;&#36807;&#25165;&#36807;&#21435;&#20102;&#19968;&#20010;&#26376;&#26102;&#38388;&#65281;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A month ago, I was just an Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King, nothing noteworthy on Racial Convergence Planet! But now, I've already reached Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, becoming one of the top warriors on Racial Convergence Planet!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought to himself, "A month ago, although I wanted revenge, I didn't dare reveal my inner thoughts! Because if discovered, my enemies would easily crush me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But now, even when facing Frederick, I have the strength to fight! I just don't know what kind of gains Frederick will have here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne's expression turned a bit serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick's understanding of the Skyfall Casket far surpasses everyone else's; he has prepared for this for an incredibly long time. Osborne couldn't believe that Frederick would gain nothing or die inside the Eighth Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hope he doesn't break through to become an Imperial Empyrean Sacredness! Otherwise, he'll still be a big problem!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth in anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No matter what, as long as my strength is strong enough, even if he breaks through to become an Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, I won't be afraid! So, keep improving my strength!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne observed his surroundings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could no longer use the Apocalypse Bow, so naturally, he could no longer pose a threat to the astral projections of the surrounding Imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he could observe in advance and pick those astral projections most likely to be taken down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as tomorrow comes and the Apocalypse Bow can be used, he can kill them and gain their power!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I can kill one Imperial Empyrean Sacredness astral projection every day, perhaps within a month, I can break through from Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection to Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I wonder if the Skyfall Casket will remain open for a month..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could only wait patiently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had nothing to do in the safe zone, so he simply took out a piece of Inferior Imperial Artifact Armor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his current strength, he was no weaker than Adriana. Since Adriana could control the Inferior Imperial Artifact Armor, so could he.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne decided to take advantage of the time to leave his Soulbrand on the Inferior Imperial Artifact Armor and take control of it first.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thus, Osborne's life began to become more structured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When the Apocalypse Bow was usable, he would shoot down an Imperial Empyrean Sacredness's astral projection, steadily growing stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After finishing the battle, he would start learning to master and control the Inferior Imperial Artifact Armor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the blink of an eye, another four days passed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This day marked the twenty-fifth day since the Eighth Skyfall Casket opened...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And on this day, the environment of the Ancient Battlefield would change once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne put on the Inferior Imperial Artifact Armor, ready for action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, the Ancient Battlefield began to change.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this time, the change was unexpected. No new astral projections appeared; instead, all the existing astral projections vanished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The once bustling Ancient Battlefield suddenly fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "All the astral projections on the Ancient Battlefield disappeared? Why is this?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He frowned, unable to figure it out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without these astral projections, his cultivation level couldn't improve.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, the Ancient Battlefield began to change abnormally.</span></p><div class="pagination">
