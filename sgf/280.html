  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once exquisitely decorated wedding venue at Rose Castle was now in disarray. All the guests had left, leaving only members of the Ashford and Caldwell families behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wedding had not taken place as scheduled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa and Venom Lord had targeted Clarissa for assassination. To prevent the guests from interfering, Venom Lord released his toxin at the first opportunity, poisoning everyone into unconsciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time they awoke, an hour had passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guests were clueless about what had transpired. The management of Rose Castle, the Draco Group, offered a feeble explanation. "An unexpected incident occurred, but it has been resolved without any casualties."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the explanation was hardly convincing, no one dared to press for more details.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With such an event, the wedding could not proceed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Ophelia sat blankly in a corner, her stepmother Evelyn trying in vain to comfort her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no hope left in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time she closed her eyes, all she could see was Osborne&mdash;now transformed, handsome, and distinguished&mdash;kissing Clarissa and placing the invaluable Crown of Fate atop Clarissa's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This caused Ophelia a pain that felt like her heart was being wrung out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was unwilling to admit that she already regretted her actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, after their divorce, was every bit the perfect husband she had imagined. She regretted divorcing him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had thought Wesley outshined Osborne in every way. She believed marrying Wesley after leaving Osborne was the wisest decision she had ever </span><span>made,</span><span> one she would never regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Wesley had been bested by Osborne time and again. She now knew who the superior man was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, Osborne had opened her eyes to Wesley's true nature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley was the notorious backer of the Scarlet Gang! He had even advised them to kidnap innocent women and force them into prostitution!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia could not accept such a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I regret it," Ophelia murmured in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn's body jolted, her lips tightly pressed together, speechless. In her mind, she also saw the image of Osborne, and... the picture of him taking his revenge on her parched body as he pinned her to the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's too late for regrets now, Ophelia," Evelyn said with a sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne is with Ms. Radcliffe. You should be well aware of her status and position. We can't compete with her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's body </span><span>trembled,</span><span> her lips tightly pressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, even if she regretted it, it was useless. Osborne had divorced her; he was her ex-husband now. He was with Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how much she regretted it, there was no turning back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the things she had done to Osborne had already broken his heart. Even if he wasn't with Clarissa, he wouldn't come back to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia felt her heart aching even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He once said he would make me kneel before him one day, regretting divorcing him! He said he would make everyone in the Caldwell family regret it. And now he has."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia murmured, "If kneeling before him in repentance could win him back, I would do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn shuddered again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could say anything to comfort Ophelia, Wesley approached with a group from the Ashford family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ophelia, our marriage..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia looked up, her face cold, cutting Wesley off. "Wesley, our engagement is off! After what's happened, we can't possibly marry now. I've publicly declared my relationship with Osborne and revealed that I once carried his child. You must indeed despise me now, right? Well, I also hate you now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, we can't possibly marry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley's face darkened at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression contorted as he snarled, "Ophelia, not marry? Who do you think you are? What do you take my dignity for? What do you take the Ashford family's dignity for?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can accept not marrying, but I want you to be my secret lover from now on! How Osborne played with you, so will I!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's face was covered with anger at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood up and slapped Wesley hard across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Scum! Wesley, are you even a man? You couldn't handle Osborne, took a hit from him, and now want to take it out on me, right? I despise you! I once thought you were formidable, but now I've come to realize you're nothing but a coward!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not even a thousandth of Osborne! Osborne could play with me because I was his wife. I would have cooperated with whatever he did! But who are you? Get out now! Right away!" Ophelia raged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley, slapped and humiliated by Ophelia's words, went mad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed her by the neck roughly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitch, you dare hit me? You dare act high and mighty with me? I'll show you exactly what kind of man I am!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a maniacal expression, Wesley began to tear at Ophelia's clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, the Caldwell family members rushed to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Ashford family members were more numerous, blocking them all, leering at the struggling Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Struggle all you want, you bitch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The more you struggle, Ophelia, the more excited I get! Look down on me, do you? Think I'm not as good as Osborne? Now I'll show you, I'm a damn sight better than Osborne! I'll make you scream!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
