  <div class="container"><p style="text-align:left;">As Wade raised the lightning staff, the thunder from above seemed to go wild, converging into a dazzling light that pierced through the dark clouds and connected to the tip of the staff.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The power surrounding Wade became immensely terrifying.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He didn&#x27;t rush to attack but instead said, &quot;You bastard, this is the Paltrow family&#x27;s inherited level four magic weapon—lightning staff.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;With it, even if my strength isn&#x27;t quite Class AA, it won&#x27;t be too far off. Killing someone like you, a Class A martial master will be effortless. Are you still going to struggle?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I see you might be somewhat talented, so I&#x27;ll give you a chance. Surrender with Clarissa and become slaves to the Paltrow family, and I will spare you both.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Otherwise, I will kill you immediately.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Wade&#x27;s demeanor was arrogant.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne couldn&#x27;t help but laugh. &quot;Do you think I haven&#x27;t seen Class AA masters? You are nowhere near Class AA. Relying on a magic weapon to try to kill me? Go ahead and try.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Wade&#x27;s face turned cold. &quot;This is your own doing. Then you can die.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The lightning staff erupted with even more dazzling light, and the thunder above grew increasingly violent. The sky seemed to tear open as a terrifying bolt of lightning flashed down toward Osborne.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne felt as though the lightning had locked onto him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But he didn&#x27;t panic. While protecting himself with his martial arts aura, he also manipulated the power of the lightning elements.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne, too, controlled the lightning elements.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Now, as a Class A Power Master, his control over lightning was far beyond what it had been before. After merging with the soul of powers, his speed and strength in using power, along with his control over elemental forces, exceeded that of any power master at the same level.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne was now on a brand new path of cultivation.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Even Isa didn&#x27;t know what Osborne&#x27;s future would become.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In any case, Osborne&#x27;s control over lightning was powerful.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Though Wade was Class A+, Osborne&#x27;s mastery over lightning was no less than his.</p><p style="text-align:left;">However, since Wade had the lightning staff, Osborne couldn&#x27;t counter him, no matter how adept he was at controlling lightning.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Still, he was confident he could weaken Wade&#x27;s lightning attack.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne channeled his energy, and the terrifying lightning aimed at him lost more than half its power in an instant. It struck against Osborne&#x27;s martial art aura, creating violent ripples but failing to penetrate it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;How is this possible?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Wade suddenly exclaimed.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Just then, he felt that his attack had weakened significantly, vanishing into thin air, leaving behind an attack that couldn&#x27;t harm Osborne at all.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The threat he posed to Osborne was even less than that of Alexander.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After all, although Alexander&#x27;s extra energy was also derived from the lightning element, it was a mutated version, so Osborne couldn&#x27;t interfere with Alexander&#x27;s energy releases.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne smiled, &quot;Wade, is this all the strength you have? If so, not only will you and Alexander die, but your family will also perish.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">After saying this, Osborne stepped closer to Wade.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Wade&#x27;s expression darkened. &quot;You want to destroy the Paltrow family? How bold you are! Keep trying to kill me.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Wade raised the lightning staff high, unleashing dazzling light and summoning even more terrifying lightning to strike down at Osborne continuously.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Such an attack made Evelynn, Charlie, and others watching from a distance feel their hearts race.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Wade&#x27;s power is somewhat frightening. Luckily, we didn&#x27;t act impulsively earlier. Otherwise, against him, we might not be a match.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Charlie murmured.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Evelynn nodded, her expression equally grave, but she didn&#x27;t look at Wade. Her gaze remained fixed on Osborne.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;That person seems strange.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She murmured, &quot;Faced with such terrifying lightning attacks, even I would only dodge and wouldn&#x27;t dare to withstand them. But he can actually use defense against such fierce lightning.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;His martial art aura has issues.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Charlie was astonished.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;It indeed does. His martial art aura has such strong defensive power that even ordinary Class A+ masters wouldn&#x27;t possess such strength.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Evelynn nodded. &quot;There&#x27;s more. His control over lightning is also formidable. He weakened Wade&#x27;s lightning attack.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Wade is manipulating lightning with a level four ancient magic weapon, yet Osborne can still weaken Wade&#x27;s attack. This indicates that his mastery over lightning is likely higher than Wade&#x27;s.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Charlie was shocked. &quot;How is this possible? Wade is genuinely a Class A+ master. Could that guy&#x27;s power also be Class A+?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Evelynn shook her head. &quot;I don&#x27;t know. But he certainly is peculiar. Let&#x27;s observe a bit more.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">The group continued to watch the battle unfold.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The terrifying thunder rained down furiously on Osborne, yet each time it fell, it dissipated most of its power mid-air. Osborne&#x27;s martial art aura easily blocked the remaining force.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander, having recovered, joined forces with Wade to attack.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But even together, they still couldn&#x27;t injure Osborne.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne walked step by step toward the two, bathing in the thunder.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He coldly remarked, &quot;Have you two had enough fun? Now, it&#x27;s time for you to go.&quot;</p><div class="pagination">
