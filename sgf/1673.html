It surged forward, hitting a barrier before breaking through in record time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the potency of the Elixir was nearly spent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the effects finally settled, Osborne found his dark elemental essence firmly established at the early stage of Level Seven, not far from mid-Level Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't believe my dark elemental essence has surpassed my space elemental essence! The power of this blue Miracle Elixir is </span><span>amazing! </span><span>If only I could get </span><span>more!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt </span><span>so good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even</span><span> </span><span>the core energy of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to enhance his elemental essence didn't compare </span><span>with </span><span>the effects of the blue Miracle Elixir.</span><span> The </span><span>blue Miracle Elixir</span><span> did a much better job!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity</span><span> was not good enough</span><span>. Instead, it just wasn't the right fit. </span><span>In terms of </span><span>energy</span><span>,</span><span> the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity</span><span> was surely more superior than blue </span><span>Miracle Elixir</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I still </span><span>own</span><span> four</span><span> lines of core energy of </span><span>Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.

Osborne</span><span> was curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, he didn't have time to </span><span>do </span><span>that right now. </span><span>Upgrading</span><span> his Satan's Eye to Level Ten would </span><span>help him a lot</span><span>, </span><span>and his Infinite Devouring Eyes would be enhanced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His speed to </span><span>break through realms</span><span> would also get faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>N</span><span>o new technique with my dark elemental essence breaking through Level Seven?" he murmured to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, an overwhelming surge of information flooded his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's </span><span>coming</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wave of information felt far more massive than what he had experienced when his space elemental essence broke through to Level Seven, leaving him astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His brain raced to process the influx of knowledge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne </span><span>processed</span><span> the information, vivid </span><span>pictures</span><span> began to flash before his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saw glimmers of light in the darkness, terrifying battles, endless screams, and rivers of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt as if he was locked in combat with a fearsome opponent, both of them engulfed in shadows, colliding amidst a torrent of dark energy. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that chaotic struggle, he sensed himself being </span><span>defeated</span><span>, the echoes of countless gasps ringing in his ears</span><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gasped for air as the </span><span>pictures</span><span> swirled around him. They were hazy, yet the emotions were crystal clear. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pressure from that mysterious</span><span> rival made him feel hard to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He </span><span>frowned and </span><span>thought, "What the hell is </span><span>that</span><span>?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why are these visions surfacing in my mind? Is it a side effect of my dark elemental essence breaking through?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forget it! I need to </span><span>stay </span><span>focus</span><span>ed now</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pushed aside his confusion and continued to absorb the information flow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he </span><span>got what he wanted!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>new dark power techniques!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like when his space elemental essence had broken through, this time, he was rewarded with three new dark power techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eclipse of Eternity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Undead Cataclysm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abyssal Spear!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly set to work mastering these new techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eclipse of Eternity unleashed a dark power that brought shadows over an entire area.

T</span><span>hey couldn't see, hear, or feel anything.
