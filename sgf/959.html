  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Flame!" Osborne shouted again, unleashing a torrent of fire that seared Gerardo's blood, igniting a fresh wave of agony within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, however, Gerardo didn't scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had grown accustomed to the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the toll on his body was becoming alarmingly apparent as his wounds worsened. With Osborne's relentless support, Sebastian hammered Gerardo again and again, each strike echoing like thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's breaths were growing shallow and labored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once more, Sebastian sent Gerardo crashing to the ground, blood pouring from his mouth as he struggled to remain standing. Yet amid the chaos, Gerardo's eyes glinted a deep crimson, a fierce rage bubbling within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo exclaimed, "Ha! Look at you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't expect to be pushed this far! A Class AAA little punk causing me so much trouble? I underestimated you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo trembled, but there was a palpable surge of terrifying power radiating from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't let him talk! Kill him!" Osborne yelled in alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Osborne could utter another word, Sebastian unleashed his next attack, sensing the shift in Gerardo's energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, an explosive force erupted from Gerardo, sending Sebastian hurtling backward, blood spewing from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression shifted to one of shock as he swiftly caught Sebastian in mid-air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes widened in disbelief as they stared at Gerardo, who was now emanating an overwhelming presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell is happening?" Osborne muttered, furrowing his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo was on the brink of defeat, yet now he seemed more dangerous than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian shook his head, clearly at a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, be careful! If things go south, you need to run. Don't worry about me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, stubbornness igniting within him. "No way! We're in this together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's body tensed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued to watch Gerardo with an unwavering focus. The energy surrounding Gerardo intensified, and even Sebastian found it difficult to approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo cackled suddenly, a chilling sound that sent shivers down their spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sebastian, this was meant for you! A little surprise I've been saving. But now? Now it's time for you both to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Gerardo's form twisted violently, morphing almost inhumanly before their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Medusa?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before their astonished gazes, Gerardo transformed into something monstrous&mdash;a </span><span>reflection of Medusa herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear to Osborne that this was no ordinary shape-shifting power; he could feel an aura of monstrous strength radiating from Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was divine power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian shouted in horror, "Oh no, that's the Medusa deity! He's fused his body with her remains, temporarily wielding divine power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, we need to run! Gerardo can manipulate divine power now; we don't stand a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian grabbed Osborne by the shoulder, bolting away as fast as they could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can escape?" Gerardo taunted, his voice twisting into something unearthly, sharp, and feminine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't immediately launch an attack; instead, Gerardo seemed to revel in his newfound form, admiring his body as if it were a flawless piece of art.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For twenty long years, I dedicated myself to merging this Medusa deity with my own body, and just recently, I finally succeeded!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Though it's not a perfect union yet, and there are still some issues, it's more than enough to take you down! I am now a true god!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Any Class S who stands before me is nothing but worthless trash!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sebastian, Osborne, you two are the first to witness this power of mine. Even in death, you'll have something to be proud of!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his words echoed, a chilling light flickered in Gerardo's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Petrify!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sudden pulse, the energy surged from his gaze, reaching out across the distance where Osborne and Sebastian had taken refuge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, they froze in place; their bodies halted as the stone began to creep over them. It only took a breath for the stone to envelop them completely, leaving them immobile, not even a finger able to twitch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fear etched itself across their expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "How could this be? At such a distance, Gerardo has managed to petrify us with a mere glance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian was among the elite of Class S, not much weaker than Gerardo. Yet, despite his formidable strength, he had been effortlessly turned to stone by Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of power was this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed only a true deity could wield such terrifying abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their minds raced in shock, but their bodies were powerless to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo laughed, his voice dripping with mockery as he seamlessly appeared in front of both of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He regarded the statues of Sebastian and Osborne as if they were corpses, a grim satisfaction shining in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, it's time to send you both off to hell!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
