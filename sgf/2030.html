  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light's gaze was unwavering, filled with conviction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He told me to hold on a little longer. Once he returns, everything will come to an end! I believe in him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm waiting for his return, and I know he will come back! When he does, he'll resolve the Human Community's struggles in Celestara. He will defeat Lord Malevolence and the Dark Deity Legion, bringing peace to our world!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He has never failed in what he set out to do!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, admiration shone in her eyes, a radiant glow that made Osborne momentarily speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't realized just how deeply God of Light revered the God of Night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear she idolized him, and that stirred something unsettling within Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, he couldn't contain himself any longer. "But what about Isa? Why do people say she's the God of Night's woman? And I've heard that you confirmed this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you seen them together in person?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes locked onto hers, searching for answers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light looked taken aback, clearly caught off guard by his sudden shift in topic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa? Well, she's a disciple of the God of Night. Her talent is exceptional, and she inherited his powers. As for her being his woman... that's something she claimed herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never saw them together because by the time I learned about Isa, the God of Night had already disappeared to carry out his plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa showed me some evidence, and it was enough to convince me that she truly is his woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression dimmed slightly as she spoke, but then she noticed the storm brewing in Osborne's eyes, the growing tension in his demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did Isa show you?" Osborne's voice trembled slightly. "What could prove she's with the God of Night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fists clenched tightly, a surge of frustration coursing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light frowned, her brow furrowing in concern. "What's wrong? Why are you so fixated on Isa? Do you know her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne bit his lip, refusing to answer, his gaze locked onto her, waiting for clarity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of hesitation, God of Light shook her head. "I'm sorry! This is a secret between Isa and the God of Night. I can't divulge it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I can assure you that Isa is indeed the God of Night's woman. He chose her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never expected him to choose her, though. The rest of us&mdash;me, God of Death, God of Destiny, God of Time, and God of Life&mdash;we all admired him! Except for the God of Space, we all had feelings for him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He knew about our affections, but he never chose any of us. It was only a thousand years ago, before the God of Death, God of Destiny, and God of Time burned their powers to help him and entered reincarnation, that he finally promised... he would marry them when they returned. But unfortunately..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light trailed off, a shadow crossing her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression darkened further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't gotten a clear answer about Isa's relationship with the God of Night, but her unwavering tone left him gasping for breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "So, Isa really is the God of Night's woman?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did she betray me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could this happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thoughts spiraled in his mind, anguish tightening around his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Images of Isa flashed through his mind&mdash;their laughter, their shared moments&mdash;and each memory felt like a dagger to his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bitter laugh escaped him, self-deprecating and hollow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How pathetic," he thought, feeling the weight of despair settle heavily on his shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As God of Light noticed the deepening shadows on Osborne's face, her concern grew. "Osborne, what's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath, trying to steady himself. "I'm fine, just thinking about some troubling things. Where were we?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh right, you mentioned that the God of Night promised to marry the God of Death, God of Destiny, and God of Time when they reincarnated, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light hesitated for a moment before nodding. "Yes, that's correct. He made that promise, and he always keeps his word. But it's strange&mdash;despite a thousand years passing, none of them have returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only God of Time has come back, but by the time she did, the God of Night had already vanished. And soon after, she learned about Isa being the God of Night's woman..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head, a hint of sadness in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, God of Time is blocking the entrance to the Sanctum of Night, demanding answers from Isa. But Isa seems preoccupied and hasn't acknowledged her at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Sanctum of Night is completely under Isa's control now, sealed off tight! Even I can't enter without Isa's permission..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, God of Light glanced at Osborne, whose face had turned gloomy and grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clenched his teeth and said, "The God of Time, blocking the entrance to the Sanctum of Night? To question Isa? Can you tell me where the Sanctum of Night is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light furrowed her brow. "Osborne, what are you planning</span><span> to do</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head, unwilling to share his true intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't let God of Light know that he intended to confront Isa and demand an explanation for her betrayal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it because the God of Night was stronger than him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More capable?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then there was God of Time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would never forget how God of Time had cast him into the chaotic space currents, nearly leaving him to die in deep space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne needed to settle that score, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he had to rescue Ophelia's soul from the seal the God of Time had placed on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But all of that had to remain a secret from the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just tell me where the Sanctum of Night is! I have something crucial I need to take care of there!" Osborne's tone was firm, leaving no room for argument.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light hesitated, about to respond when her expression suddenly hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned sharply to look outside the Sanctum of Light, her eyes narrowing with alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Eight Dark Sovereigns have finally arrived!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart raced as he followed her gaze outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once bright surroundings had morphed into an oppressive darkness, swallowing all sound and light. It felt as if the Sanctum of Light had been sealed away in a void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is happening?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the sealing technique of the Ninefold Heaven's Tower! We're trapped in a seal! The only way out is to break it!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
