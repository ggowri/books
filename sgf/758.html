  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm using martial art at Class S from Eityreia Organization, Stealth Arts! I've already mastered it, so how can you possibly see me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger's voice dripped with anger, but there was a hint of panic behind it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wasn't particularly powerful, barely on par with Stuart, having only just broken into Class AAA. But with the Stealth Arts at Class S exclusive to Eityreia Organization and his dagger, he could easily take down opponents at Class AAA.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He'd even managed to assassinate experts from the Godson Rankings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet here he was, facing Osborne, and his supposedly unbeatable stealth was completely useless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once might be a coincidence, but twice?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne had definitely figured out his technique.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was as if Osborne knew exactly where and when Roger would strike, dodging effortlessly and countering without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This threw Roger off balance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stealth Arts?" Osborne muttered, a calm smile tugging at his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The truth was, Roger's Stealth Arts relied on merging his body with the surrounding space. When he disappeared, he was actually hiding in Dimensional Space.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, no matter how sharp someone's eyesight was, they couldn't see Roger because he wasn't even in the same space.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Plus, Roger was excellent at masking his energy, making it nearly impossible for most people to detect him before he struck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Osborne was a spatial power user.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For him, Roger's stealth wasn't much of a challenge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger, now clearly frustrated, snapped, "How the hell are you seeing through my Stealth Arts?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne just smiled and said, "Call it a strong sixth sense."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sixth sense?" Roger scoffed, narrowing his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You really expect me to believe that? Even if you're that lucky, you won't always dodge me. I can keep trying, but you? You only need to mess up once, and you're dead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's see you dodge this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger vanished again, slipping into the dimensional space as he silently moved toward Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne could feel exactly where Roger was but decided to let him get closer, waiting for the right moment while quietly gathering his strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger was biding his time, waiting for Osborne to make a mistake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sensing this, Osborne decided to play along, deliberately letting his guard down just a bit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Got you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger took the bait, emerging from the dimensional space with his dagger aimed right at Osborne's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's eyes flashed with cold determination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger's attacks were all lethal, clearly aiming to kill him in one strike, which only fueled Osborne's anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Get lost!" Osborne roared, unleashing a punch he had been holding back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His fist smashed into Roger's shoulder with crushing force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger hadn't expected the opening to be a trap. The blow shattered his shoulder, and he dropped his dagger as he was sent flying across the arena, blood spraying as he crashed hard onto the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne caught the dagger mid-air and calmly pocketed it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked down at Roger, his voice cold, "You lost. Is this over now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Struggling to get up, Roger saw his dagger in Osborne's hand and spat out blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Give... give me back my dagger!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smirked. "You tried to kill me, got your ass kicked, and now you want your dagger back? Why would I do that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because I'm with Eityreia Organization!" Roger's voice dripped with anger, his eyes full of threat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hand over the dagger, and we're done here. Otherwise, you'll never know peace. We will hunt you down endlessly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You'll die, and so will everyone you care about! Everyone connected to you will pay the price!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes blazed with a mixture of rage and madness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's expression tightened, and a flash of deadly intent crossed his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger was clearly not bluffing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment's thought, Osborne reined in his anger, pulled out the dagger, and tossed it back to Roger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This ends now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger snatched the ancient dagger, his face twisted in contempt and cold satisfaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without saying another word, he shot Osborne one last icy glare before quickly making his exit.</p><div class="pagination">
