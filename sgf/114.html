  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As each uncut diamond was about to be cut, Barlyn and Austin felt a mix of anxiety and anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, remained nonchalant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew exactly what was hidden within each uncut diamond and wasn't expecting any surprises. Although the diamonds he selected weren't particularly high in value individually, together, they amounted to a substantial sum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After his selection, the Ashford family's diamond dealing market was essentially finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would be impossible to cut out diamonds worth tens of millions, or even millions, in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here it goes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first uncut diamond was finally being cut. Austin eagerly rushed forward to open the cutting machine's cover, with Barlyn close behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the cover lifted, Austin let out an excited exclamation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin's face lit up with excitement and delight. "It's glassy one! It's a bit greenish. Although it's not very large, it's worth at least 20 million dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn, who wasn't very familiar with diamond values, was thrilled by Austin's reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was just the first of the uncut diamonds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had bought over forty uncut diamonds in total, and if each one turned out this well, they could potentially make over 800 million!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, in his mind, Barlyn knew that wasn't likely, but the prospect was still thrilling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to their agreed distribution, both he and Austin would get thirty percent each, so several million were already in the bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha, let's keep going!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Barlyn and Austin were in high spirits, while Wesley and Ophelia were visibly uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just 200 million, at least it's not as bad as last time." Wesley consoled himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last time, Osborne had cut out over 20 pounds of glassy diamond worth more than a billion, which had made him spit blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty million was something he could handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cutting continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia, deep in thought, suddenly approached Osborne and said softly, "Osborne, when did you start sucking up to Ms. Montague? Your charm with women is quite extraordinary. But as a man, when will you rely on your own abilities instead of women? When will you live on your own merit?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced at Ophelia with a calm expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does it concern you? I'll curry favor with whoever I want and rely on whoever I choose. It's none of your business."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's face flushed with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having been in a relationship with Osborne for four years and married for three, she had never heard him speak to her like this before. His icy tone stung.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they were already divorced, and she had no authority over him now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting her teeth, Ophelia said, "I'm only looking out for you! Relying on women is just temporary. Once they think you're no longer useful, they'll toss you aside like yesterday's trash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked, retorting, "Ophelia, are you speaking from experience? Do you think every woman is like you, ready to discard her husband when he's deemed useless?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His scornful expression made Ophelia uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought to herself, "I know asking for a divorce was harsh, but I had no choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Wise Order required me to divorce Osborne to ensure that the Caldwell family's fortune wouldn't fall into the wrong hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I had to be ruthless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever. I'm still trying to help you! And if you had shown the capability you have now back then, we wouldn't have had to divorce. The Wise Order wouldn't have forced us to split."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, "So now it's my fault?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not saying it's your fault, but if you had shown your abilities earlier, we wouldn't have ended up like this. You have to make things awkward for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia then glanced at the cutting machine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, several uncut diamonds were being sliced open, each revealing a high-quality diamond worth at least 10 million if not several tens of millions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even someone with no experience could tell that Osborne's method of selecting these uncut diamonds was extraordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was unheard of for every single uncut diamond to yield a gem of such high value.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's breath quickened with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "If only these uncut diamonds were picked out by Osborne for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hurriedly called out, "Osborne, come back! We may not be able to be together, but we can still be business partners! You have an incredible knack for selecting uncut diamonds, and with the Caldwell Group's expertise in jewelry design and sales, we could make a great team!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pick out the uncut diamonds, cut them, and once the money starts rolling in, the Caldwell family can give you a 10% cut of the profits!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback, his eyes widening in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at her with contempt. "You want me to go back to the Caldwell family? And you're offering me a 10% share?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ophelia, your ambition far exceeds your capabilities. Don't make such offers again; we're done. I won't be working with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne turned on his heel and walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia stood there, stunned, her fists clenched tightly as regret and frustration welled up inside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, over forty uncut diamonds had been sliced open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn and Austin were so excited they could barely contain themselves, eagerly calculating how much money they were about to make.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Wesley felt overwhelmed, on the brink of passing out from the shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spat out blood again, his condition worsening by the second.</span></p><div class="pagination">
