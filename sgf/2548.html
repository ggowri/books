  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne discovered that his Soul Current Ocean had become completely different from before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It had become larger and more vast, like an immense ocean.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, it was a pure golden ocean.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Powerful soul power turned into golden seawater, flowing within the Soul Current Ocean. At the center of the Soul Current Ocean stood an enormous tree, its roots embedded in the golden Soul Current Ocean, absorbing its power and giving back in return.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is the true form of Primordial!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is also an offshoot of the World Tree!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And further toward the edge stood another peculiar tree. Its leaves were Sacredness Level warships, and various Sacred Artifacts hung from its branches.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That is the Warfare Ancient Tree!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Warfare Ancient Tree is also rooted in the Soul Current Ocean, with its roots entwined around the corpses of Empyrean Sacredness beings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among them is the corpse of the Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There are also over twenty Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection corpses and hundreds of Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warriors' corpses...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These Empyrean Sacredness corpses drift and dissolve in the Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most of their power is absorbed by the Warfare Ancient Tree, with a small portion merging into the Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the edge of the Soul Current Ocean lies an incredibly solid Soul Current Ocean barrier, covered with intricate and mysterious patterns.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These patterns make Osborne's Soul Current Ocean more stable and indestructible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My Soul Current Ocean, how did it become like this?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial appeared in the Soul Current Ocean, excitedly saying, "You should ask yourself! After taking the Perfect Dragon Elixir, what exactly did you experience? Why hasn&rsquo;t your cultivation level improved, but your body and Soul Current Ocean have changed so drastically? What exactly happened to you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial was extremely curious at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne also wanted to know, so he carefully explained to Primordial what happened after taking the Perfect Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial was stunned after hearing it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A void of chaos? Feels like there's nothing? Yet somehow everything?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Could it be that you are..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Entered the Chaotic World before the universe was formed? The very Chaotic World where the World Tree, Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, and Warfare Ancient Tree were first born!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That Chaotic World is the origin of everything!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Because after the Chaotic World exploded, the chaotic matter within gradually transformed, forming this cosmos and giving rise to countless Acquired Creatures! That Perfect Dragon Elixir actually brought you back to that Chaotic World?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's the birthplace of Primordial Creatures! Entering there means you're absorbing Primordial Energy every second, so such a huge transformation is understandable!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's Primordial Energy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In this cosmos, Primordial Energy has long been incredibly scarce, almost extinct! The changes and improvements you see from absorbing Primordial Energy are nothing at all!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Those unseen changes..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are the true opportunity!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Primordial finished speaking, he looked at Osborne with some resentment, his eyes full of envy and jealousy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He is just an offshoot of the World Tree, not considered a Primordial Creature.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He has never been to that long-exploded Chaotic World, nor has he absorbed Primordial Energy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I had known that taking the Perfect Dragon Elixir could grant access to that Chaotic World, I would have done anything to get the Perfect Dragon Elixir!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I could enter that Chaotic World, perhaps I wouldn't need to devour the Tree Heart energy of other World Tree offshoots to revert to ancient times and become a true World Tree!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial was heartbroken at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was shocked by his words. "I went to that exploded Chaotic World? Absorbed Primordial Energy? Does that make me a Primordial Creature now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial rolled his eyes at Osborne upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Keep dreaming!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are Human, and Human is an Acquired Creature! Even if you went to that Chaotic World, it wouldn't change that! So, you are still Human! It's just that absorbing Primordial Energy has raised your limits as a Human..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You want to become a Primordial Creature?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial smirked and said, "Unless you find a new Chaotic World and completely devour and absorb it, there might be a slight chance! Otherwise, you'll always just be an Acquired Creature!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shrugged.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Acquired Creature is just Acquired Creature, nothing special! Isn't this cosmos now ruled by Acquired Creatures?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't you Primordial Creatures also have to live under the rule of Acquired Creatures?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial fell silent upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial Creature and Acquired Creature only differ in their birthplace&mdash;one born in the Chaotic World before the universe's creation, the other born within the cosmos.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In terms of average strength and talent, Primordial Creatures are definitely stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when it comes to peak combat power...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Acquired Creatures are in no way weaker than Primordial Creatures; otherwise, they wouldn't be able to rule this cosmos.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne doesn&rsquo;t feel inferior just because he belongs to the Human Community and is an Acquired Creature.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What level has my soul power reached now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne changed the subject and asked Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial shook his head. "I don&rsquo;t know! But I think even a true Imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior couldn&rsquo;t forcibly break through your Soul Current Ocean! The strongest aspect of your Soul Current Ocean is its solidity&mdash;those mysterious patterns, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, are likely Primordial Marks!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is the Primordial Mark protecting that Chaotic World, just not as powerful! Even so, breaking through your Soul Current Ocean would be very difficult."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"From now on, you'll be the nemesis of any cultivator skilled in soul power attacks!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne heard this and gave a faint smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Primordial Mark, huh? Good stuff..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then those mysterious patterns on every cell in my body, are they also Primordial Marks? Are these Primordial Marks what enhanced my body's strength?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're a monster now! Among the same cultivation level, even the physically strongest Beast Clan or Silicon-based Lifeform would find it hard to surpass your strength."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled, even more satisfied.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By the way, how long have I been in seclusion? I won't miss the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne suddenly thought of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, feeling a bit worried.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry, you've been in seclusion for sixteen years!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"According to the timeline, there are about twenty days left until the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne heaved a sigh of relief upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh right, I almost forgot to check my elemental essence progress!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately checked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, a look of surprise appeared on his face. All his elemental essences had reached the mid Sacredness Level, and his primary elements&mdash;space, darkness, thunder, and fire&mdash;had even reached the advanced Sacredness Level!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was much stronger than before his seclusion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Combined with the enhancement of soul power and physical strength, which together form the six forces of Sacred Power, Osborne had undergone a complete transformation, making his Sacred Power terrifyingly strong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such a level of Sacred Power strength even made Osborne feel it was a bit too overwhelming.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With my current strength, if I encounter an average Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, I should be able to confront them head-on and even defeat them without relying on Flash, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I encounter an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, I might still be able to fight!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was full of confidence in himself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes gleamed sharply. "Next, no more training! I'll spend quality time with my parents, grandpa, and maternal grandpa, then return to Racial Convergence Planet to participate in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My revenge should begin now!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
