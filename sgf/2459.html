  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Ian announced Dustin's score, everyone exclaimed in surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dustin got 64 million Scorepoints!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He got 1 million more Scorepoints than Mckinley. But Dustin became the runner-up, leaving Mckinley as the second runner-up!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dustin won!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Dustin's face was full of smiles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Actually, before Ian announced his score, he had already calculated it. After all, it wasn't hard for him. So, upon seeing Mckinley's score, he was certain he would be the runner-up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian had 1 million more Scorepoints than Mckinley.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at Mckinley and said with a faint smile, "Mckinley, this time I'm going to win! The runner-up will be mine!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mckinley snorted coldly, "You're lucky! When it comes to the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, we can have a match. By then, I won't lose to you again!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dustin shrugged. "I'll be waiting for you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Brenda also said to Dustin, "Dustin, congratulations on getting the runner-up. And Mckinley, third place isn't bad. At least we can all go to Eastern Zone 3 for the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel to fight for glory."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dustin smiled and said, "It's a pity that the gap between us and you is too big. We're no match for you at all! We should congratulate you in advance on winning the championship!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Same to you!" Brenda replied with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, someone suddenly said calmly, "It seems like you haven't secured the championship and runner-up yet, right? There are still scores that haven't been tallied, like Osborne's. If Osborne's score exceeds 64 million, Dustin won't be the runner-up!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And what if Osborne turns out to be the champion?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, the surroundings instantly became very quiet. Everyone's faces showed expressions of astonishment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That's right. Osborne's score hasn't been tallied yet!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, everyone turned to look at the person who spoke.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was Horace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Horace, like Osborne, was also representing Zephyr State in the competition. He once had a chance to win the state duel championship, but he ultimately lost consecutively to Agnes and Osborne, finishing in third place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During the state duel, Horace had already been defeated by Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, seeing that Osborne's score hadn't been tallied yet, Dustin was already certain he had secured second place and had begun celebrating, which immediately made Horace feel dissatisfied.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt that Osborne might create a miracle, just like what happened during the state duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before the state duel began, no one could have imagined that Osborne would rise from over a hundredth place in the rankings to become the champion, even defeating Agnes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Horace still held expectations for Osborne at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, his words sparked public outrage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For a moment, someone retorted disdainfully, "Osborne's score absolutely can't exceed 64 million. At most, he'll get 50 million Scorepoints. Even if he's lucky, he'll only make it into the top ten. There's no way he can compete with Dustin for second place!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As for the champion, well, that definitely belongs to Brenda!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Horace, you weren't in our team before, so you have no idea how much Brenda has gained these days! If you knew, you wouldn't say such foolish things!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's right. Ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone fiercely scolded Horace, making him look very embarrassed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He did act alone, so he didn't know how many Scorepoints Brenda had gained, but he felt that everyone underestimating Osborne would eventually embarrass themselves.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He snorted coldly, "Just wait and see!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Horace fell silent. His achievements were actually impressive, and he had redeemed over ten million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints. He could rank within the top 200 on the leaderboard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Horace was already very satisfied with this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even up to now, Horace was already the highest-ranked contestant from Zephyr State.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Until now, no one in Zephyr State had made it into the top 200.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Horace could only hope that Osborne would surprise everyone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph!" At this moment, Brenda glanced coldly at Horace and said indifferently, "A bunch of narrow-minded people! Do you really think Osborne can compete with me for the championship? Ridiculous! Now, I'll show you why I'm so confident that I'll be the champion!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll show you how many points I actually have!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Brenda walked toward Ian.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She originally planned to reveal her achievements after everyone, including Osborne, had finished tallying their scores.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne was still meditating with his eyes closed, showing no intention of revealing his score. Moreover, Horace's words had left Brenda quite displeased, so she decided to approach Ian early to tally her own score.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She believed that once her achievements were tallied, everyone would shut up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those who thought Osborne might threaten her championship would say no more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda proudly walked up to Ian.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian looked at Brenda and smiled faintly, "You performed very well! With such strength at this level, you are already one of the top warriors under the Empyrean Sacredness on Racial Convergence Planet. With a disciple like you, Skyearth Dominion is bound to become even stronger in the future."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Brenda politely smiled and said, "General Ian Augustine, thank you for your praise! I will work even harder. When the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel arrives, I will do my best to bring glory to Eastern Zone 3."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda remained composed, and everyone couldn't help but applaud.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Others felt a bit nervous when facing Ian, even trying their best to flatter him, but Brenda did not.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As an elite disciple of Skyearth Dominion, she displayed her confidence and charisma.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, this was something others hadn't achieved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian was also surprised, but after hearing Brenda's words, he just smiled mysteriously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you want to bring glory to Eastern Zone 3 in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel? Not bad! Just having this thought is already commendable. However, with your current strength, you're still far from enough. You should keep working hard and prepare more!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Brenda was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Could it be that with her current strength, she still couldn't bring glory to Eastern Zone 3 in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda didn't know that during the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, the princes and princesses of the Glorious Divine Kingdom's royal family would participate, so she was very unconvinced.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She felt that Ian had no idea about her strength and was just underestimating her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, she said calmly, "General Ian Augustine, please help me tally the results first! All my achievements are here. You might need some time to go through them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Brenda directly took out eight Dimensional Bags.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing the eight Dimensional Bags, Ian was stunned, and everyone around was taken aback.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Others only brought one Dimensional Bag when tallying their scores.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even for those who earned tens of millions of Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, one Dimensional Bag was enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Brenda took out eight Dimensional Bags.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each of her Dimensional Bags looked similar to theirs, not of a lower grade. If Brenda's achievements required eight Dimensional Bags to hold, how much would that be?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone felt extremely curious, and anticipation was written all over their faces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We'll soon find out exactly how many points Brenda has!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I guess he has at least 300 million Scorepoints!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Three hundred million? Not enough! Didn't you see her eight Dimensional Bags? I think she has at least 500 million!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian smiled and said, "Alright. I'll calculate your score first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Ian waved his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instantly, as the eight Dimensional Bags were opened, their contents densely filled the air, almost blocking out the sky.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, everyone was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh my God! There's so much!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
