  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sacred light descended, enveloping the young woman in its glow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instantly, her horrific wound began to mend, as if death itself had retreated, leaving no trace of her injury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For a brief moment, Maia's expression was blank, a shockwave of confusion crossing her features.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she instinctively knew&mdash;Osborne had saved her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her eyes, filled with gratitude and lingering fear, locked onto Osborne as if he were a lifeline.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Greyson, Aleena, and the rest of the Lambert family finally arrived at the scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Osborne unharmed and Maia well, a wave of relief washed over Greyson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Maia, what happened?" Greyson asked, concern etched into every syllable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Maia snapped back to reality, her voice trembling as she relayed the events.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Greyson Lambert, I felt like I was already dead! If it wasn't for him, I don't know if I would ever see you all again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The disbelief was palpable in the air. As they listened to her story, the Lambert family's members exchanged shocked glances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had thought that the assassination attempt by the Eityreia Organization had failed, but through Maia's account, they realized the truth&mdash;although the attempt had initially succeeded, it was Osborne who had heroically pulled her back from the grasp of death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gratitude swelled among them as they turned their eyes toward Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a casual smile, he tilted his head, sizing Maia up with curiosity. No wonder she looked familiar; she was Maia!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The last time, during their trip to Tethynia for Cuthbert's Honor Quest Ceremony, he and Emma pretended to be siblings Axell and Maia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma had even dressed up as Maia, using her photograph as a reference.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Greyson exclaimed, his tone turning serious, "Godfather, I really appreciate you stepping in!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Maia represents one of our brightest young talents in the Lambert family. Losing her would have been a catastrophic blow to us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne said, "Mr. Greyson Lambert, no need for that. I came here to help, to lend a hand to the Lambert family during its crisis. Unfortunately, I was too late, and Scarlett got away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Greyson's expression darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Scarlett? Blood Princess? Are you certain the one who tried to kill Maia was Scarlett?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne nodded confidently. "Absolutely! I've crossed paths with her before, and I wouldn't mistake her for anyone else."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as he spoke, the mood shifted dramatically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The faces of c grew somber, shadowed by concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't just Scarlett's capabilities they feared; it was her lineage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sure, she was a formidable fighter, currently ranked within the top twenty among her peers in the Godson Rankings, and any average Class S would be in serious trouble if they crossed paths with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the true source of their anxiety lay in her parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They were no ordinary assassins; they were the second and third top killers in the Eityreia Organization&mdash;Sin and Crimson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This legendary couple was a force to be reckoned with in the assassin community, both ranked within the top fifty of the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings, capable of decimating ordinary Class S experts with ease. When they joined forces, few could stand against them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The members of the Lambert family thought, "With Scarlett showing up, could Sin and Crimson, those top-tier Class S assassins, be lurking nearby as well?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If they're after the Lambert family, do we even stand a chance anymore?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, despair clung to nearly every member of the Lambert family, Greyson included. The fear was evident in their eyes, and a heavy silence fell over them like a shroud.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne surveyed the scene, his brow furrowed with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He understood all too well the sheer strength Sin and Crimson wielded. Not long ago, they had joined forces with Rumen and Everett, launching a coordinated attack on the Augustine family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them had even managed to ensnare God of Star.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At least for now, Osborne knew he stood no chance against them. The thought of an encounter with those assassins sent a shiver down his spine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, deep down, he felt a flicker of conviction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne thought, "Right now, Sin and Crimson are probably not lurking around here. The Lambert family just isn't significant enough to draw their attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Besides, I'd wager they're wounded. They were injured even before facing off against God of Star, and their condition only worsened as they focused on keeping him occupied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They must be somewhere nursing their wounds."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Taking a deep breath, Osborne broke the tense silence, his voice steady and reassuring. "Mr. Greyson Lambert, there's no need to panic!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure, Sin and Crimson are deadly, but they're not invincible! And I can assure you, they're injured and likely not in the vicinity right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if they were close, their abilities would be compromised. That gives us a fighting chance!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The words hung in the air, and suddenly, hope seemed to spark in the eyes of the Lambert family members.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A glimmer of hope began to flicker in Greyson's eyes as well, a fragile yet unmistakable spark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He clenched his jaw, determination growing within him. "Godfather's right. We can't let fear dictate our actions! The Eityreia Organization might want to wipe us out, but we can't cower in the shadows!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He straightened his posture, injecting a sense of resolve into his voice. "If it comes down to it, we'll stand and fight! We've endured too much to give up now!"</p><div class="pagination">
