  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time whizzed by in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the depths of his seclusion, Osborne once again savored the perks of having a wise teacher. A single piece of advice had worked wonders, extricating him from a hopeless situation and paving the way for a new breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, Osborne had got into the groove.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The essence of his thunder power was seamlessly blending with his Sacred Power, becoming an integral part of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Turns out, merging powers isn't all that tough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If I hadn't taken a wrong turn and squandered so much time, I might have integrated the thunder power into my Sacred Power long before the city duel started.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I wouldn't have had to struggle so hard in the duel and could've emerged victorious with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but heave a sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he attentively sensed the lightning power fusing into his Sacred Power, he was brimming with energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, the words of Adriana popped into his mind, and Osborne quickly reined in his excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This is just the merger of the third power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">There are still plenty of Supernal Deity Kings in this world who have combined four powers. Each subsequent fusion will only get trickier. It's far too early to rest on my laurels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Back to seclusion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The integration of the lightning energy went like a dream. Meanwhile, Osborne was also making leaps and bounds in other aspects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he knew it, he had finally reached Ascension Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally, the Ninth Stage of the Ascension Realm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was over the moon. Without delay, he reached out with his senses to check on Alfreda's life essence. But his face soon fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no change in Alfreda's life essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still couldn't bring her back to life using it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've made it to the Ninth Stage of the Ascension Realm. So why can't I revive Alfreda? Could there be something amiss?" Osborne murmured, frowning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then called out, "Primordial!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial popped up in a flash, transforming into a tiny treant and hovering in front of Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's up? I'm in the middle of my seclusion, you know!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne filled Primordial in on the situation. "Primordial, didn't you tell me I could revive Alfreda once I reached Ascension Eight, or better yet, Ascension Nine? Well, I'm already at Ascension Nine. So why can't I do it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Primordial stroked its chin thoughtfully. "Maybe your strength still isn't up to par. Or perhaps we underestimated that old geezer from the Ethereal Elven Temple. He's no ordinary Empyrean Sacredness warrior. Even among those at that level, he's likely a heavy-hitter!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't fret, though. As long as Alfreda's life essence remains intact, and your strength keeps growing, you'll surely bring Alfreda back one day!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Ascension Nine isn't enough, then wait until you hit Ascension Ten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if Ascension Ten doesn't cut it, you'll definitely be able to revive Alfreda once you reach the Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brows deeply. "I guess that's all I can do for now..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, he fixed his gaze on Primordial and asked, "Primordial, how's your strength these days? You've been holed up in my Soul Current Ocean for seclusion. I've noticed a significant boost in my soul power. Has your strength grown as well?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Primordial wore a smug expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your Soul Current Ocean is perfect for me! With the help of your Soul Current Ocean, my rate of improvement is very fast! Right now, I'm already comparable to an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King! Of course, I'm still not as good as you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial looked somewhat helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's rate of improvement was too fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was surprised and said seriously, "You're already comparable to an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's already very impressive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial gave Osborne a sidelong look, let out a snort, and declared, "Are you sure you're complimenting me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll outshine you in no time! What's more, the quickest way for me to level up is to take out other World Tree offshoots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I can just take down another World Tree offshoot and soak up its Tree Heart energy, I'll leave you in the dust in an instant! I've got a hunch that there's a World Tree offshoot on the Racial Convergence Planet. It's just that I can't pinpoint its location for now...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'd better focus on beefing up your own strength! I might need your hand before long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Primordial retreated back into his Soul Current Ocean, Osborne got back into his seclusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the various forces were having a heated discussion about the state duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you heard the news? There are twin brothers in the neighboring Sands Fury City. Each of them is a real powerhouse. They dominated the competition and grabbed first and second place in the Sands Fury City duel! They're even boasting that they'll wipe the floor with all their opponents in the Zephyr State's state duel and represent Zephyr State in the zone duel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who gives a hoot about those twin brothers from Sands Fury City? I heard the champion of Lacustrine Mirror City has fully mastered the power of a Sacred Artifact. One move from him and no one stands a chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And then there's the champion from Blood-soaked Iron City..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you ask me, none of these guys are up to snuff. To shine in the state duel, raw individual strength is just the starting point. The real key is to build a killer team! Remember, this state duel isn't just a regular tournament; it's a wild-style battle. You can't make it far relying on solo combat alone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard the eight major academies in Zephyr State have banded together! Our Azure Haven Academy in Tempest Fortress City is one of them. When the time comes, Leroy, Marreese, Pero, and other heavyweights from Azure Haven Academy will team up with the top guns from the other seven academies. Word on the street is they're saying they'll snag at least three of the top ten spots!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Heh, so what if the eight major academies have joined forces? They're just Second-rate Powers. The ones who'll really make a splash in the state duel are still the disciples from First-rate Powers. I heard that elite disciples from First-rate Powers like Chilling Nether Palace, Resurgent Throne Palace, and Fiery Volcanic Isle are coming to Zephyr State for the state duel. Their strength is way above that of the elite disciples from Second-rate Powers. They're the ones most likely to shine in this state duel..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can never tell. Anything's possible in a territory battle in the wild! I think Osborne from our Mystic Sirius Sect also has a shot at standing out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha, you're being way too optimistic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our Mystic Sirius Sect is just a low-rung Second-rate Power. Even though Osborne is the champion of Tempest Fortress City, it's next to impossible for him to make a mark in the state duel without any support! It'd be a win if he could even make it into the top 100!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's face it, Tempest Fortress City didn't even have a single contestant in the top 100 in the last state duel. Osborne's probably going to max out around the 100-mark."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alas, what a shame! Osborne's incredibly talented. In a regular tournament, even if he couldn't crack the top 10, he'd at least make it to the top 50, right? The top 100 would be a walk in the park. But this state duel is a wild territory battle. He's up against whole teams of tough opponents. How can he possibly compete?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's not set our hopes too high. Osborne's win in the city duel has already brought us a lot of pride. We can't ask for more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disciples of the Mystic Sirius Sect were chatting away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All across Zephyr State, in a hundred cities and among hundreds of Second-rate Powers, there were heated discussions going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the Zephyr State authorities put out a list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This list had all the participants for the upcoming state duel and ranked them according to the strength they'd shown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person at the top of the list was named Agatha Woolley.</span></p><div class="pagination">
