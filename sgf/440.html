  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing those words, Clarissa slowly turned around, locking her gaze on Dylan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan was Clarissa's father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, at that moment, the look she gave him held none of the affection one might expect from a daughter. Her eyes were filled only with anger and cold indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you all so determined to force me to marry Alexander?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't I even have the right to choose who I marry?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan responded coolly, "We're doing this for your own good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For my own good?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's smile was tinged with sorrow. "You think separating me from the person I love is for my own good? Forcing me to marry someone I don't care for is for my own good? You would rather push me to despair than let me be happy. How is that for my own good?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not doing this for me at all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan frowned, trying to persuade her. "Clarissa, don't get so worked up. Think about it carefully. How is Alexander inferior to Osborne in any way? I admit Osborne has achieved a lot and is the heir to an ancient family, but by every measure, he's far from being Alexander's equal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are a Fatebearer, and you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa cut him off sharply. "You've repeated these arguments countless times, and I'm tired of hearing them. I'll tell you again. In my heart, Osborne is the best! He promised we would face everything together. He promised he would come for me, and he will!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he hasn't shown up yet, it's because he's preparing. I believe he'll come. If he doesn't, then..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa bit her lip, her eyes resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In any case, stop trying to convince me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan was infuriated. "You're hopeless! Osborne is not as great as you think. He's a divorced man! He's not worth your love!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa smiled, her tone calm. "So what if he's divorced? I love him, and even if he weren't divorced, now that I've fallen for him, my heart belongs to him alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Clarissa turned away, no longer paying attention to Dylan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan trembled with rage, his fists clenching, but in the end, he said nothing more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke coldly, "No matter what, your wedding with Alexander cannot be canceled. In three days, you must attend the ceremony. If you refuse, your grandfather will personally drag you there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Prepare yourself to become Alexander's wife!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you hate us now, one day, you'll understand our good intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne will not come to pick you up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if he does, he'll die at the hands of the Paltrow family. You and he will never be together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Dylan waved his hand and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna sighed softly, speaking in a low voice, "Why has it come to this? We're family. Why make such a fuss?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, she moved to stand behind Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She placed her hands on Clarissa's shoulders, feeling a slight tremor in her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, what will you do if Osborne doesn't come for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa bit her lip. "He will come!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I mean, just in case. There's always the chance something could go wrong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Not this time. As long as Osborne is alive, he will come for me! I trust he won't break his promise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's resolve was unshakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna opened her mouth but ultimately said nothing more. In her heart, she thought, "Osborne, I hope you live up to Clarissa's trust and don't let her down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, you're the only one who can save her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were three days left until the wedding. At the Paltrow Estate, preparations for the ceremony had already begun, with servants bustling everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In three days, Alexander would officially become the head of the Paltrow family and have a wedding with Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both events would be grand affairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dampston's social elite, as well as many important figures from other provinces, were expected to attend the Paltrow family's grand occasion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alexander and Wade were sitting opposite each other in the study.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade's face was full of delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alexander, have you finally solidified your power and absorbed the strength of the Blessing of Thunder?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander smiled and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was full of confidence, looking very proud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he had every reason to be proud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At twenty-eight, Alexander had become a Class A Power Master. Upon his breakthrough, his strength had already far exceeded that of an ordinary Class A. After absorbing the power of the Blessing of Thunder, he felt that even a person in Class A+ would be no match for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a pity that Osborne stole so much of the Blessing of Thunder's power. Otherwise, I would have already reached Class A+ by now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of Osborne filled his heart with hatred, and he couldn't help but ask, "Wade, what is Osborne up to now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade shook his head. "We don't know. Our informant in the Augustine family had an unfortunate accident and died, so we've lost access to intelligence on the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, Osborne hasn't shown his face for half a month. It's like he's vanished. Maybe he's hiding because he's afraid to come to the Paltrow Estate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vanished? Hiding?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alexander frowned, then shook his head. "Impossible! When he challenged me, his gaze was resolute. He would never hide away in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's been preparing, planning to take Clarissa away from me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Wade's face was full of contempt.</span></p><div class="pagination">
