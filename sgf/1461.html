  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne calmly raised his sign and spoke, a hush fell over the auction room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana turned to look at him, a mix of surprise and confusion on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She mused, "Did he really just bid? And not just by a little&mdash;he jumped straight from three million to four million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"While others were upping their bids by a mere 100 thousand, it was clear the only contender left at three million was the Margery family from the Rainbow Viper Clan. They believed three million was already the limit for this group of human female slaves. Any bid beyond that just wouldn't make sense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, if he bid three million and 100 thousand, the Margery family would likely back out and let him have them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But here he went, throwing out four million!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It doesn't add up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is he genuinely bidding, or just stirring the pot?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana frowned, her concerns echoing the thoughts of those around her, especially the members of the Margery family, who were visibly miffed at this unexpected challenge to their apparent victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you just here to create a scene?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Margery family member shot a hostile glare at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne merely smiled, unfazed. "Creating a scene? I'm just placing a normal bid here. How does that make it causing a ruckus?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! Who bids like that? Three million is the cap for these human slaves. Can't you see everyone else has already pulled out? You just jumped a million in your bid. Don't tell me you're not just messing around."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged. "Who says they've hit their limit? In your eyes, they might be worth three million, but to me, they're priceless. Besides, there are no rules against making bids of a million in an auction, are there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You seem a bit too anxious, my friend! And the bottom line is: I've got the cash, I'm having a blast, and who are you to tell me how to bid? If you've got the dough, go ahead and raise your bid; if not, maybe you should just zip it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words hung in the air, leaving the crowd momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone there stared at Osborne in disbelief, shocked by his cheeky and bold demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the speaker were from the Demonic Dragon Clan, Soaring Lion Clan, or Mystic Feather Clan, th</span><span>ose</span><span> words might be deemed awe-inspiring, prompting admiration and envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the speaker was from the Human Community&mdash;a group they regard as profoundly inferior and primitive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had a Human Community ever dared to speak with such bravado in Wild Flame City?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Never, or if they had, it had ended badly for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Walter, the head of the Swift family&mdash;the strongest Human Community family around&mdash;would never dream of talking to the other clans like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of irritation rippled through the audience, many feeling a deep-seated discomfort at being reprimanded by someone they considered beneath them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead of reacting, everyone's eyes turned to the Margery family member, whose expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for death. A lowly wretch like you thinks you can shut me up? You really believe that once you step out of this auction, you won't be knocked out and wound up on the slave block by tomorrow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a palpable threat in his voice, and others around couldn't help but snicker, chuckling at Osborne's apparent naivety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes narrowed slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't you try? Let's find out if I'll end up on that slave block, or if I'm going to punch your lights out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Margery family member's eyes gleamed with menace. "Oh, it's on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll see about that! You're the first lowly human to talk to me like this, and you'll certainly be the last."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By this time tomorrow, I guarantee I'll be back at the slave market, buying you right off that shelf. You'll be in for a rough ride, believe me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he ignored Osborne entirely and turned his attention to Tiana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Tiana Hart, I suspect this guy is just making random bids to stir things up! I demand an immediate check on his financial status because I doubt he even has four million Essence Crystals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, he's just a lowly Human Community member."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The fact that any Human Community even survives in Wild Flame City is impressive enough, let alone having four million to bid on twenty slaves! I don't buy it, and I'm sure no one else does either!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He must have his funds verified before he can continue participating in this auction!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished his tirade, many in the crowd began to murmur in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely, we need to check his finances! Otherwise, he'll throw this entire auction into chaos with his outrageous bids!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We must verify!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do it now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with the crowd's escalating outcry, Tiana furrowed her brow and glanced at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think, Lachlan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The name caught many by surprise, and whispers rippled through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's Lachlan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't he the one who was just disavowed by the Swift family and kicked out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! So it's him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems he really is here to cause trouble. How could a guy who's been booted from the Swift family possibly have four million Essence Crystals?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Must be out of his mind!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
