  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley was stunned, thinking he must have misheard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Have you lost your mind, Osborne? If you dare to squander money at the auction, I won&rsquo;t let you off,&rdquo; Ophelia snapped. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne had extorted 20 million dollars from the Caldwell family, and she was still figuring out how to get it back. She didn&rsquo;t want Osborne spending that money here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne, however, ignored her and asked calmly, &ldquo;You surely are not too scared to accept, right, Mr. Ashford?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley sneered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared? As if.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He then raised his voice and declared, &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, please bear witness. This peasant dares to challenge me to a spending contest at the auction. Whoever spends the least has to submit to the other.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that, the crowd erupted in laughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;A commoner challenging Mr. Ashford to a spending contest? Isn&rsquo;t that just asking for humiliation.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Alright, we&rsquo;ll bear witness for you!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With a look of triumph, Wesley sneered, &ldquo;Loser, I&rsquo;ll soon show you just how big the gap between us is.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t compare your entire fortune to my pocket money because you can&rsquo;t. To me, you are just a penniless loser.&rdquo; He was sure he would win.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just then, a sudden commotion broke out around them, and everyone quickly turned their heads toward the VIP entrance, paying no more attention to Osborne and Wesley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ms. Radcliffe is here!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Hello, Ms. Radcliffe!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ms. Radcliffe, you look even more stunning.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even Wesley and Ophelia couldn&rsquo;t focus on Osborne anymore. They both looked thrilled and rushed over to offer greetings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was curious and turned to look as well. Then, he was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A beautiful silhouette had come into view, stepping out from the VIP lane.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was a girl around twenty years old. She was tall and graceful, with glossy hair and eyes that sparkled like stars, bright and brilliant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The girl&rsquo;s nose was straight and elegant, her lips full and rosy, exuding a distant coolness. Her skin was smooth and delicate, flawless like porcelain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was dressed in a luxurious gown, and she carried herself with a noble and composed grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In short, this girl was not only stunningly beautiful, but her innate nobility made her seem to glow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s ex-wife was also a beautiful woman, but compared to this girl, it was like comparing a firefly to the radiant moon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He didn&rsquo;t know why, but the moment he saw her, his heart started to race wildly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As Osborne stared at the girl, he was momentarily lost in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In fact, he wasn&rsquo;t the only one reacting this way. Most of the men around, regardless of age, were just as mesmerized, if not more. The girl was simply too dazzling and beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Right then, the Draco Star Wristlet on Osborne&rsquo;s wrist suddenly buzzed, bringing him out of his daze with an incoming message.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He glanced down and was immediately surprised as the message read: [The second successor&rsquo;s trial has begun.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne didn&rsquo;t expect the second successor&rsquo;s trial to start at this moment. He quickly clicked open the message to check the details of the trial. Then, he was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The message read: [Within three days, you must get close to Clarissa, the chosen one of the prominent Radcliffe family, and stay by her side.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After reading the trial details, Osborne couldn&rsquo;t help but take a sharp breath and look at the dazzling girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had gathered from others that she was Clarissa Radcliffe, the legitimate heiress of the prominent Radcliffe family and the most beautiful woman in Mayby City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne pondered. <span style="font-style: italic;">Did </span><span style="font-style: italic;">the </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Godfather say she is the chosen one of the Radcliffe family? What does that mean? </span><span style="font-style: italic;">And he</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> wants me to get close to Clarissa and even stay by her side? </span><span style="font-style: italic;">But</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> the trial period is only three days?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He then couldn&rsquo;t help but frown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This trial didn&rsquo;t seem as dangerous as the first one, but its difficulty gave Osborne a headache, as Clarissa&rsquo;s status was just too high.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was a true VIP of the Draco Group, personally accompanied by Debbe, and entered through the VIP lane.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">While other people&rsquo;s bodyguards had to stay outside, Clarissa had a large team of bodyguards with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As soon as she appeared, all the big shots present, whether heads of noble families or leaders of major corporations, scrambled to surround her with flattery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa&rsquo;s team of bodyguards kept everyone at a distance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She remained aloof in the face of everyone&rsquo;s flattery, her expression as cold as that of a proud princess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Is a legitimate heiress of a prominent family truly this dignified?&rdquo; Osborne muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He then saw Wesley and Ophelia, successors to noble families themselves, also trying to talk to Clarissa, but they were rudely pushed away by her bodyguards. They didn&rsquo;t even dare to get angry because the difference in their statuses was too vast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley and Ophelia, who had been so proud in front of Osborne, now appeared humble and insignificant before Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even after being rudely pushed away, they still kept smiling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;This is what power looks like.&rdquo; Osborne couldn&rsquo;t help but marvel inwardly, but thinking of his successor&rsquo;s trial, he started to feel a headache coming on again.</p><div class="pagination">
