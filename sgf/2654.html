  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Weston, Quinn, Naomi, and Hendrix were slapped hard by Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The four clenched their teeth tightly, staying silent. Even as their teeth were knocked loose and blood dripped from the corners of their mouths, they dared not make a sound.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because Frederick's expression was terrifying at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone around was watching Frederick's actions, clearly sensing his anger rising rapidly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, he stopped.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He turned his head, coldly looking at Osborne, and calmly said, "I've done what you asked. Now, can you open the Eighth Skyfall Casket?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't make any more excessive demands because he knew Frederick didn't care about his wife and children's feelings and wouldn't always be driven by Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne kept making demands, Frederick was very likely to turn hostile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And once Frederick turned hostile, it would be a disaster.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't possibly take the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear into the black vortex.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So he had to open the Eighth Skyfall Casket now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he was extremely reluctant to do so, he understood there was no other choice. In the current situation, if they didn't open the Eighth Skyfall Casket, they would have no chance of survival.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, "Of course, I have seen your sincerity. So, I have decided to open the Eighth Skyfall Casket, and everyone will explore together."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he looked at Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana gritted her teeth and said, "There's no other way, we have to open it. Although Frederick is the most familiar with the Skyfall Casket, he may not necessarily gain the greatest benefits. He might not find the opportunity to break through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness in the Skyfall Casket!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Back then, among the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet, only three broke through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness. Frederick won't be that lucky. Perhaps, he will die in the Skyfall Casket."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could hide in the Celestial Spire, but Adriana and the others couldn't. If they wanted to survive, they had to open the Eighth Skyfall Casket; only this way could they buy time and stay alive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath. "Cover me. I'm going to open the Skyfall Casket!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright!" Adriana said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She used her power to shield Osborne, Clara, and the others as they headed toward the location of the Eighth Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick saw this and immediately became excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, he wouldn't stop them to avoid any more accidents. To him, both Osborne and Adriana were targets to kill, but he wasn't in a rush. His priority now was to open the Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wouldn't allow any more accidents.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The massive Necropolis City was pyramid-shaped, with the towering Celestial Spire at the top and nine majestic Skyfall Monoliths below.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Eighth Skyfall Casket was located on the lowest level of Necropolis City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne and his group quickly arrived near The Eighth Skyfall Casket, truly feeling its majestic grandeur at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was clearly a continent!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It stretched tens of thousands of kilometers, with both width and height reaching thousands of kilometers, floating in the vast starry sea like a rectangular cosmos.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he approached the Skyfall Casket, Osborne finally felt the terrifying aura emanating from it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bronze-colored Skyfall Casket was covered with intricate and exquisite patterns. Osborne gently touched it and instantly felt a bone-chilling cold, as if even his blood was about to freeze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "What exactly is hidden inside the Skyfall Casket? Could it really just be a coffin? What kind of enormous being would require such a massive coffin?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More importantly, I sensed a faint spatial energy fluctuation on the Skyfall Casket. Its exterior is already astonishing, but the internal space might be even more vast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Inside the Skyfall Casket, it&rsquo;s probably a world completely different from the outside!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was thinking rapidly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Frederick and the others followed them from a distance, also sensing the terrifying aura of the Skyfall Casket, their expressions grave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Osborne arrived at the very center of the Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A massive hexagram pattern was engraved here, and at its very center was a hole resembling a keyhole.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne knew that inserting the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear into this keyhole would unlock the Eighth Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he did not act immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He turned to look at Frederick not far away and said calmly, "Frederick, may I ask, what exactly is inside the Skyfall Casket? Is there any danger? How should we obtain opportunities and power within it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as you tell me this, I will open the Skyfall Casket immediately!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick sneered. "How would I know the specific situation inside the Skyfall Casket? Although Solomon, the ancestor of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, was one of the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet and had entered the Ninth Skyfall Casket, leaving some records behind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Ninth Skyfall Casket contains nine Skyfall Caskets, each completely different. The situation of the Ninth Skyfall Casket may not apply to the Eighth Skyfall Casket!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned but understood that Frederick had a point.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the Eighth Skyfall Casket has never been opened, so naturally, no one knows what&rsquo;s inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Then tell me about the situation in the Ninth Skyfall Casket. Even if each Skyfall Casket is different, we can still draw some experience from it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick hesitated upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he finally said, "Since you want to know, there's no harm in telling you. Each Skyfall Casket seals a world. Upon entering, everyone will be transported to different locations within that world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"For example, the Ninth Skyfall Casket seals an incredibly magical continent. On that continent grow countless unique plants, and the flowers and fruits they bear are all Supreme medicines!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as you consume them, your strength will rapidly increase!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet also gained their rapid strength boost because of this!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne's eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So it turns out the Skyfall Casket indeed seals a world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He continued to ask, "Then why, among the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet, only three broke through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness? How were their experiences in the Skyfall Casket different from the others'?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick's expression shifted slightly upon hearing this, and he replied coldly, "I don't know. Maybe those three obtained more Supreme medicine, so their cultivation levels increased more. Or perhaps, it's simply because they have higher talent."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They separated after entering the Skyfall Casket. Everyone encountered different things, so their gains naturally varied."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but sneer after hearing that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt that Frederick wasn't telling the truth, but judging from Frederick's attitude, no matter how he pressed, Frederick wouldn't reveal the real story.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne speculated, "Perhaps, besides those Supreme medicines that enhance strength, there's something even more precious in the Skyfall Casket. That might be the key to breaking through to Imperial Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since Frederick is unwilling to reveal it, I'll have to find it myself!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked directly at Frederick. "One last question, is there any danger in the Skyfall Casket?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick asked back, "If I say there's no danger, would you believe me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled calmly. "Of course, I don't believe it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne ignored Frederick and swiftly inserted the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear into the hole.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom!</span></p><div class="pagination">
