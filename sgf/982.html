  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's confidence radiated from him as he spoke, bringing a sense of resolve to the tense atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason the Lambert family found themselves ensnared and haunted by the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization's assassins wasn't due to a lack of strength; it was their inability to see through the organization's deadly Stealth Art.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The constant threat of imminent assassination cast a deep shadow over the Lambert family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With danger lurking around every corner, no one could live without fear. If this continued, the family members would eventually wear down, and their spirits would be eroded day by day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization was terrifying not just for its lethal skills but also for its patience and mastery of stealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne was different; he had resources that set him apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization's Stealth Art was formidable, Osborne had his Satan's Eye and spatial power. Most of the assassins' tricks would be ineffective against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recalled Scarlett's Stealth Art, which had evaded his detection before. It was undoubtedly of a higher caliber, and he knew it required significant energy to maintain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wouldn't use it unless she intended to attack, and in times of peace, she'd likely keep her abilities under wraps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a straightforward confrontation, he could spot her easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once discovered, he could use interdimensional travel to appear by Scarlett's side in the blink of an eye, employing the power of his Realm to hunt her down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only variables were the two Class S assassins in play; Osborne couldn't be completely certain in that regard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Lambert family had their own Class S warriors to shift the odds in their favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a plan quickly taking shape in his mind, Osborne turned to Greyson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lambert, go prepare the others. I want everyone ready. Tonight, we'll take out the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization's assassins and make our way to the Augustine Estate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greyson's eyebrows shot up in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't a clue why Osborne was so confident, but he didn't question it. After all, Osborne had risen to become the new Godfather with the recognition of the former Godfather for a reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deciding to trust him, Greyson felt that in their perilous situation, they had little choice but to place their bets on Osborne and his plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll get right on it! Godfather, the lives of nearly a thousand of us in the Lambert family are in your hands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Greyson hurried off to make arrangements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Greyson was gone, Osborne made his way to the highest point of the Lambert family's strongest building. Standing atop the rooftop, he silently activated his Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, let's see just how many of you are lurking in the shadows!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he opened Satan's Eye, the world around him transformed. The dense trees and underbrush faded away, replaced by complete transparency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with powers resembling X-ray vision, Osborne knew that the assassins' Stealth Art might still obscure them&mdash;at least for a time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stealth Art consumed energy, and it was used mainly for assassination attempts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, even the top-tier assassins couldn't maintain such concealment indefinitely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During their downtime, the assassins relied on impressive disguises to blend into their surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the face of Osborne's X-ray vision, those efforts would be laughable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift sweep of his Satan's Eye, he could see everything within a two-mile radius. It didn't matter if the assassins were hiding in trees or camouflaged in the grass; they'd all be laid bare before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he scanned the area, a sense of anticipation surged through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was time to turn the tables.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne began counting with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Satan's Eye, while still at Level Six after a long period without upgrades, had grown increasingly powerful. It was the perfect tool for hunting down these elusive assassins skilled in the art of concealment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In recent weeks, he had absorbed a significant amount of star power through Satan's Eye, pushing it to the brink of a breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, for reasons he couldn't entirely grasp, it remained stuck at Level Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His grandfather Sebastian had explained that the time issues plaguing the solar system were the cause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The effects of a Level Seven Satan's Eye were intricately tied to time itself, and until the solar system's temporal anomalies were resolved, no one could surpass that threshold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Osborne sensed that his Satan's Eye was on the verge of a breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recalled Isa's words about the God of Time&mdash;the entity responsible for restoring the solar system's time flow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was out there searching for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but wonder how she was faring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaking off his worries, he reminded himself that Isa was incredibly powerful; he had no reason to fret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's focus needed to be on eliminating the assassins outside and resolving the Lambert family's dire situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forty-nine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fifty!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, there are fifty assassins from the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, huh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like you'll be the first ones to feel my wrath."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those chilling words hanging in the air, he prepared to take action.</span></p><div class="pagination">
