  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne spent an entire day slowly torturing Hendrix, venting his anger and hatred.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix wasn't as tough as Osborne claimed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He began begging for mercy, apologizing, pleading with Osborne, even asking Osborne to kill him. However, Osborne ignored him, and even when Hendrix completely stopped speaking, Osborne still didn&rsquo;t kill him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne threw Hendrix into Drum's Dimensional Microcosm and created a Spatial Clone to torment Hendrix constantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only then did Osborne feel much better.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne murmured, "What a pity, my Spatial Clone can't help Hendrix heal his injuries. I have to wait for him to recover before I can continue tormenting him. Otherwise, he might die too easily."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can't kill him yet! I'll wait until I catch Weston, Quinn, Naomi, and Brent, Lorenzo, Lilith, as well as Callista, Frederick... Torture and take revenge on all of them first, then kill them together!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes were filled with hatred.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And now, I need to keep improving my strength! Among all my enemies, Hendrix is nothing! There are many who are much stronger than him..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I still need to keep improving my strength to take revenge better!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne began the slaughter again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, a day passed. Osborne felt he was very close to breaking through to Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection. Give him two more days, and he was sure he could succeed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, changes occurred again on the Ancient Battlefield.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It had been five days since the last change on the Ancient Battlefield. Osborne had previously speculated that the Ancient Battlefield would change every five days.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The result proved that Osborne's speculation was correct.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as the fifth day arrived, Osborne felt that the surrounding astral projections had changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They seem to have become stronger!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression changed, and he instantly dodged a powerful attack. But immediately, another attack came at him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was an attack from Imperial Empyrean Sacredness!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression was grave. He hadn't expected the surrounding astral projections' cultivation level to have risen significantly. They had advanced from Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean to Supreme True Imperial Empyrean Sacredness!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Osborne's current strength, he is no match for these astral projections.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Crystal Armor!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clenched his teeth and quickly donned the Crystal Armor. The next second, an attack struck him, sending him flying. Even with the protection of the Crystal Armor, Osborne spat out a mouthful of blood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "This won't work!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I must quickly find a safe zone! The surrounding astral projections have all reached Imperial Empyrean Sacredness level, and I can't survive in this environment. If I can't find a safe zone, I'm doomed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clenched his teeth and used his Satan's Eye to scan the surroundings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, his eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Found it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly used Phantom Steps and arrived at a calm area. In this zone, there were no traces of battle aftermath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This Ancient Battlefield is too dangerous... It changes every five days, and the strength of the astral projections shifts after each change. If I can't find a safe zone in time to hide, I'm afraid I'll be doomed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne began to worry about Adriana and Clara again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the Ancient Battlefield was too vast, and Osborne had no way to search for them. Previously, his unexpected encounter with Hendrix was already very fortunate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I wonder how they're doing now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Forget it! Worrying is useless... I'm in danger myself now! This area might not be completely safe. Besides, I can't rely on killing these astral projections to grow stronger here. I must leave and find weaker astral projections!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I don't know when the Skyfall Casket will close, but I must hurry! It's already the eleventh day since it opened, and I have to reach Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection before it shuts!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately took action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The surrounding astral projections were all Imperial Empyrean Sacredness. Not to mention he couldn't kill them, even Frederick probably couldn't grow stronger by defeating them here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could only use the previous method to reach areas with weaker astral projections.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And this method could only be used by him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Others could only wait in the safe zone, praying that the surrounding astral projections would weaken after the next change.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This way!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne chose a direction and started moving through various safe zones. After half a day, he switched directions, feeling a bit frustrated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The direction he chose had even stronger astral projections, surpassing the Imperial Empyrean Sacredness. The battles between those astral projections were so intense that even the slightest aftermath could obliterate Osborne!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial told Osborne that the strength of those astral projections was above Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, reaching Celestial Empyrean Sacredness!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those astral projections exist at least in the mid-level regions of the universe. Their consciousness can roam the skies, and both their bodies and souls can adapt to most harsh cosmic environments. With just a thought, they can obliterate an Imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their strength is beyond what Osborne can imagine right now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So above Imperial Empyrean Sacredness is Celestial Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly changed direction. But to his despair, even after changing direction, he still encountered terrifying Celestial Empyrean Sacredness warriors among the astral projections.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Too dangerous!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly kept changing directions, but no matter how he shifted, there were no astral projections below Imperial Empyrean Sacredness around him. He seemed to be surrounded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter what, he couldn't get out of this area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Looks like I have to wait five days for the Ancient Battlefield to change again!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This Ancient Battlefield is just too dangerous. Even with the help of Satan's Eye and spatial power, he couldn't ensure absolute safety, let alone go wherever he wanted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sometimes, there was no safe zone within his line of sight, and there was nothing he could do.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, the Ancient Battlefield changes every five days. Osborne can afford to wait.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In such a situation, five days passed quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne knew the Ancient Battlefield was about to change again and immediately became alert. Because when the Ancient Battlefield changes, it's the most dangerous time. The safe zone he was in could very likely turn into the most dangerous place. He had to find a new safe zone in a short time to stay safe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he couldn't find a safe zone, he would die!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, the Ancient Battlefield changed again. And this time, Osborne's luck was still terrible. The surrounding astral projections were still incredibly powerful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The weakest among them was still an Imperial Empyrean Sacredness!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The astral projections of Celestial Empyrean Sacredness appeared from time to time, making Osborne extremely nervous. A single mistake, and he could be killed by them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, he quickly spotted a new safe zone nearby and immediately hid inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought to himself, "Do I really have to hide here for five days?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit frustrated. He activated Satan's Eye to check the surroundings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Osborne's eyes suddenly lit up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He suddenly noticed a lush forest tens of thousands of miles away!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jungle?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was utterly shocked. He had been on this Ancient Battlefield for fourteen days, seeing nothing but ruins, with no living creatures. Not even a single blade of grass!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, he actually discovered a lush jungle tens of thousands of miles away! The forest was vibrant, with some crystal-clear fruits hanging on the trees.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was instantly thrilled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Could those be emperor herbs that boost cultivation level?!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
