  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking that Aaron is Brenda's master, Osborne's face instantly turned terrifyingly grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked, "How did you find me? And how did you know I would pass through here and set up an ambush in advance?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aaron smiled faintly, his expression full of arrogance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "You're about to die, so it doesn't matter if I tell you, let you die knowing. The reason I could find you is naturally because of the Ice Scepter. Although it no longer bears my mark, after using it for so long, I can naturally sense it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as you carry the Ice Scepter with you, no matter where you go, I can find you.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, young man, don't be too greedy. Don't take what doesn't belong to you, or the price you'll pay will be your life!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Aaron looked at Osborne with a mocking gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne suddenly realized, "So it's the Ice Scepter. If I had known this earlier, I should have hung the Ice Scepter on the Warfare Ancient Tree sooner. The Warfare Ancient Tree can suppress any Sacred Artifact and erase any marks or aura belonging to others!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, although Osborne regretted it, everything was already too late.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was already firmly trapped by Aaron, in an even more dangerous situation than when facing Lionel earlier. At that time, Osborne was at least near the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign and could retreat into it if pushed to the brink, seeking a slim chance of survival.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, he was far from there, completely out of options, ambushed, attacked, and injured by Aaron.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although his injuries weren't severe, he could easily recover using the power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The key, however, was that he was trapped. No matter how powerful the spatial power he used, it was completely ineffective under Aaron's suppression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that case, he could only fight desperately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, a trace of madness flashed in Osborne's eyes. He knew that even if he fought desperately, he was unlikely to be a match for Aaron, but he would never sit and wait for death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "My Kingdom Duel Badge has already been taken by someone named Lionel. So, if you want to get the Kingdom Duel Badge from me, it's impossible. Even if you kill me, it won't help."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In my opinion, you should immediately go after Lionel. With your strength, you should be able to deal with him easily and take back the Kingdom Duel Badge!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aaron was slightly stunned upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Taken by someone? Looks like I arrived a bit late. But it doesn't matter. I'm not a greedy person, and you can forget about using this trick to get away. I have a clear understanding of my strength and never deliberately fight for things that don't belong to me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Right now, what's more important to me is killing you, taking back the Ice Scepter, and uncovering the secrets you hold."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's face turned even darker.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He understood that things wouldn't end so easily. He could only fight desperately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne said no more and launched a sudden attack. He swiftly drew the Bloodwrought Bow, nocked an arrow, and formed an arrow made of Sacred Power, shooting it toward Aaron.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whoosh!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Aaron merely sneered, "How ridiculous! An ant beneath Empyrean Sacredness dares to strike at me, someone who has reached Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection? Who gave you the courage?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Aaron waved his hand lightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The arrow Osborne shot with all his might instantly shattered in mid-air, unable to even touch Aaron.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression shifted slightly, but he didn't stop moving.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He roared, "Solar Sacred Arrow! Heaven Arrow!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A terrifying Sacred Power Arrow formed on the Bloodwrought Bow, wildly devouring the surrounding light, plunging the environment into utter darkness, as if doomsday had arrived.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was Osborne's strongest arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Solar Sacred Arrow he created has three forms: Human Arrow, Earth Arrow, and Heaven Arrow. Among them, Human Arrow and Earth Arrow each contain multiple variations. Even in a zone duel, Osborne only needs to use the weakest form of Human Arrow to handle any challenge, without even needing to use Earth Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, at this moment, Osborne directly used Heaven Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Heaven Arrow has only one move, which not only instantly drains all of Osborne's strength but also absorbs the energy of heaven and earth, becoming his most powerful attack to date.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Osborne can only use Heaven Arrow once in a short period.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Facing Aaron at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, Osborne dared not hold back and unleashed his strongest attack directly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the power of heaven and earth was continuously absorbed, Heaven Arrow grew increasingly powerful, far surpassing the level expected at this cultivation stage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, even Aaron's face showed a look of shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Such powerful energy fluctuations!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I really underestimated you! Or rather, everyone underestimated you. Everyone thought you won the zone duel by luck, overpowering Brenda to take the championship. In terms of true strength, Brenda should have been the champion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I used to think the same way. But now I realize how ridiculously wrong that idea was. Just based on the power of that arrow you just shot, Brenda can't possibly match you.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Terrifying! Without reaching Empyrean Sacredness, you can unleash such a powerful attack. Your talent and potential truly shock me. Unfortunately, your cultivation level is far too low. In front of me, you stand no chance!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I want you dead, you must die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, he suddenly struck Osborne with a powerful palm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clenched his teeth tightly and released the bowstring. The Heaven Arrow shot out instantly, leaving distorted afterimages in the void and tearing open massive space cracks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, the Heaven Arrow collided head-on with Aaron's palm force. In an instant, the void collapsed, time and space became chaotic, and all surrounding sounds seemed to be completely swallowed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately after, a deafening explosion erupted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's strongest strike was shattered by Aaron's palm, scattering terrifying energy with a thunderous roar.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Aaron's palm force also disintegrated accordingly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation made Osborne's expression serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">My strength is still not enough. The gap in cultivation level and power between us is too vast. Even with my strongest move, I still can't gain the upper hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne's heart was filled with a longing for power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he had no idea how shocked Aaron was at this moment. As an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection being, Aaron was five whole cultivation levels above Osborne, who was at the Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King realm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By common sense, Aaron could easily crush Osborne with a single palm, as effortlessly as squashing an ant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the reality was that his palm strike was actually shattered by Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although it was just a casual palm strike, even an Advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior would need to give their all to achieve this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In other words, the power of Osborne's arrow just now was already comparable to the full-force strike of an Advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Truly terrifying!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aaron stared intently at Osborne and said coldly, "Someone like you shouldn't exist in this world! If you're allowed to grow, everyone who has ever offended you will be reckoned with and easily crushed by you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since I've already offended you, you must die now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, a trace of madness flashed in Aaron's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Now, I'm getting serious. I will utterly crush your flesh, obliterate your soul, and leave you no chance of survival!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
