  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Alright. If I can&rsquo;t make it, I&rsquo;ll leave on my own without making any more requests.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne nodded in agreement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He couldn&rsquo;t help but breathe a sigh of relief. Despite the twists and turns, things were finally back on track.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As long as he passed the Radcliffe family&rsquo;s bodyguard assessment, he would become Clarissa&rsquo;s personal protector, staying by her side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This way, he would be able to complete the second test.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the first test, the Godfather had rewarded him with 100 million dollars in cash, The Breath of Celestial, and a method to upgrade Satan&rsquo;s Eye to level two.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The rewards for the second test were bound to be even more abundant, so Osborne couldn&rsquo;t wait.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna nodded and said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go. We&rsquo;re heading to the shooting range over there, where the bodyguard assessment will take place.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She noticed Wesley and Ophelia looking anxious and urged, &ldquo;You two, come along as well.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Excited, the two quickly followed, trying to win over Donna along the way. Unfortunately, Donna remained serious, leaving them discouraged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon, they arrived at the shooting range halfway up the mountain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The range was vast, with a radius of several hundred yards, surrounded by trees, showcasing the immense size of the Radcliffe Manor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There were already over a hundred people waiting at the shooting range.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna explained, &ldquo;This time, the Radcliffe family has invited the top ten security companies in all of Skyefall to send their best bodyguards for recruitment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Finally, a total of one hundred professional bodyguards arrived. We will conduct three rounds of assessments to select the top five strongest bodyguards to augment Clarissa&rsquo;s security team.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She turned to Osborne and added, &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t rank in the top five, you will be eliminated. I won&rsquo;t lower the standards just because you once saved Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You still have a chance to regret it now. After all, these hundred individuals are top-notch bodyguards, and it&rsquo;s unlikely that you&rsquo;ll stand out among them.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Both Ophelia and Wesley nodded in agreement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia even chimed in, &ldquo;Osborne, I really think you should reconsider. Sure, you&rsquo;ve been my bodyguard before; your shooting and combat skills are decent, but compared to the top bodyguards from these security firms, you&rsquo;re still far behind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Remember, it&rsquo;s important to stay grounded in life. Don&rsquo;t reach for things that are beyond your grasp.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne replied with a faint smile, &ldquo;How would you know if you don&rsquo;t try? Do you really know me?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His eyes were filled with determination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia frowned and said, &ldquo;Once you hit a roadblock, you&rsquo;ll understand that I say this for your own good.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley said sarcastically, &ldquo;Some people just don&rsquo;t know how to keep their feet on the ground, always looking for shortcuts without realizing their limitations. I hope you don&rsquo;t fail too miserably in the assessment later.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne shot a look at Wesley and calmly said, &ldquo;Keep your eyes wide open and watch closely.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, Osborne headed towards the shooting range while Donna led the others to a high platform overlooking the assessment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, in Clarissa&rsquo;s chamber, she paced anxiously, her face filled with worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, a maid entered the room and exclaimed urgently,</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What is it? How is Osborne? Did Aunt Donna give him a hard time?&rdquo; Clarissa asked anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The maid swiftly recounted the situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa paused for a moment; then, a smile spread across her face. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re saying Aunt Donna demanded that Osborne not see me again, and he refused? He turned down support from the Radcliffe family to join the bodyguard selection, just to stay by my side and protect me?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Absolutely, Ms. Radcliffe. I&rsquo;m starting to think Osborne might not be such a good guy after all. Seems like he&rsquo;s interested in you, turning down benefits just to be close to you, wanting not just you but also the Radcliffe family&rsquo;s wealth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Hmph, he&rsquo;s got nerve. No one is good enough for you, Ms. Radcliffe.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa blushed slightly at her own words and shot Rebecca a fierce look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Rebecca, don&rsquo;t talk about Osborne like that. He&rsquo;s not that kind of person.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Rebecca stuck out her tongue, wisely choosing not to argue further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa hesitated for a moment, frowning. &ldquo;Osborne is entering the bodyguard assessments, but those bodyguards are top-notch. Do you think he&rsquo;ll be in danger?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;No way, I&rsquo;m going to see for myself. Osborne can&rsquo;t get hurt,&rdquo; Clarissa declared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;But Ms. Radcliffe, Ms. Donna won&rsquo;t let you see him&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll watch from the platform then.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With determination, Clarissa stormed out, her bodyguards quickly following her to the shooting range.</p><div class="pagination">
