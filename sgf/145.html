  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna's expression turned grim as well, and she snorted, "You should never say that again, Osborne. If the Chevalier family hears about it, you'll be dead. You better not drag us down with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a slight smile and didn't argue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was the only one who, surprisingly, looked at him with a smile, her expression brimming with delight and approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then spoke up, "I actually think Osborne is right. The Chevalier family is despicable. We all know the atrocious things they've done. It's just that we're too scared to say it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only Osborne has voiced my thoughts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she finished, Donna's expression shifted drastically, and she scolded, "Shut up, Clarissa! Some things are better left unsaid, or it'll bring big trouble to the Radcliffe family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she turned to look at the others. "No one is to speak of what happened here today, or else I'll deal with you myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone froze in fear at her words and hurriedly nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna continued, "Alright, enough with the nonsense. Let's get to business. Raymond's hiding place has been found, but we need to come up with a plan on how to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, since you came up with the plan to strike first, you'll be leading the team to execute it. Do you have any good suggestions?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne calmly replied, "I need to know where exactly Raymond is hiding first, and then I'll formulate a plan based on the surroundings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna nodded and said, "Raymond is now hiding in the territory of a gang called the Hyena Gang. Their territory is in the slums of the south side of the city. The situation there is rather chaotic, with over ten thousand people crammed into narrow slums.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All we know is that Raymond is hiding there, but we can't pinpoint his exact location. We also don't know how many underlings or allies he has."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing that, Osborne couldn't help but frown, as the information was somewhat lacking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was well aware of the slums in the south. The environment was extremely harsh, with ten thousand struggling poor people squeezed into an area with a radius of only two miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The area was congested, chaotic, filthy, and dangerous. Drugs were rampant, as were guns, and several underground gangs also operated there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These underground gangs had many members, but they were weak. The members were all poor people at the bottom of society forced by life to join gangs, doing things like theft, robbery, and drug trafficking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among those groups, the Hyena Gang was one of the larger underground gangs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the Chevalier family didn't even consider these kinds of underground gangs worth their time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have a plan, Osborne?" Donna urged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly considered the situation and responded, "I can't believe Raymond is actually hiding in the southern slums. The place is overcrowded and crawling with gangs, so even if we find him, it's not suitable for large-scale combat, or it will cause chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I think we should send a small group of elite forces to discreetly locate Raymond and then capture him with a swift raid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The raiding party should be no more than twenty. The rest should be positioned outside the slums for backup."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, Donna nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Your idea is similar to mine, but there's a problem. If we had too few people for the raid team, it could be very risky and may not even succeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Raymond likely had powerful allies around him. Are you sure about this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "I'm 50% sure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"50%?" Donna frowned. 50% confidence was already quite high. Even if she led the team herself and selected the best members for the raid, she wouldn't dare claim a 50% chance of success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the slum environment was too complicated, and they didn't know who or how many Raymond's accomplices there were. There was too little information on their hand, so she felt Osborne was being a bit too optimistic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Donna didn't want to discourage Osborne now, so she said calmly, "Since you are 50% sure about this, let's go for it. I'll personally lead a team to assist you from the perimeter. Even if the plan fails, we should manage to escape."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you," he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna had a peculiar look on her face. "I should be the one thanking you. No matter your reasons, you're helping Clarissa, and I owe you my thanks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, enough of that. Since you are leading the team, you should personally select the members for the raid. Let's keep it around twenty people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Each member of the raid team, whether successful or not, will be rewarded with three million dollars by the Radcliffe family. There will be additional rewards for special contributions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Donna finished speaking, Harris', Violet's, and Sharon's eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three million dollars for one operation was very tempting for them. They were in a line of work where they risked their lives, and as long as there was money, they didn't care about the danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them looked at Osborne with eager eyes, hoping he would choose them to be in the raid team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He considered it, thinking that the members of the raid team must be strong enough, but more importantly, they had to be absolutely trustworthy and follow his orders absolutely. Otherwise, he would rather not choose them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, Osborne said, "I'll take Bodyguard Unit Three and Four with me. If anyone is reluctant to go, we can replace them with members of the Personal Guards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With Barlyn and me, it should be enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Osborne finished speaking, Harris' expression shifted instantly and turned utterly grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris pondered irritably, "Osborne chose the ordinary members of Bodyguard Unit Three and Four for the raid team to earn those three million dollars, but he didn't select me, the deputy leader?" With that thought, a glimmer of malice appeared in his expression.</span></p><div class="pagination">
