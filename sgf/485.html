  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The firelight painted Osborne's face red, but it couldn't mask the cold-blooded determination etched on his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Burn in hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's flames descended upon the gang members, their eyes wide with terror and regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was too late for remorse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Screams of agony pierced the air as the flames consumed them. They beat desperately but could not extinguish the flame. They kept writhing and flailing until they breathed their last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was thick with the stench of burning flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet the fire did not subside. It was not the ordinary fire but Osborne's power and the given form of his fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fire would not die out, and his rage would not be sated until the evil was purged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of the inferno was creepy. Gavin, the sole survivor, was drenched in fear, his bladder releasing in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're the devil! You're the devil!" Gavin stammered, trying to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, "You are the real devils! Only by extinguishing your kind in more brutal ways can peace be brought to the innocent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you will die too. But not yet. You'll wait for Wallace. Savor the fear before death. Repent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Osborne turned away from Gavin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Autumn, expecting to see terror in her eyes at the gruesome scene, but he was mistaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Autumn wasn't afraid. As she watched the Hummingbird Gang members being consumed by the flames, she felt a surge of vindication.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streamed down her face as she cried out, "Mom, Luke, can you see? They're all dead! The ones who hurt us are gone. They suffered. Can you see, Mom, Luke..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Autumn cried out for her mother and brother, but no one would answer her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was already an orphan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa, witnessing Autumn's raw emotion, couldn't help but weep, her heart breaking for the child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, let's adopt Autumn," Clarissa suggested, her voice thick with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adopt Autumn?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback, but instead of rejecting the idea, he looked at Autumn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Autumn, would you like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa quickly added, "Autumn, my name is Clarissa, and this is Osborne. We'd like to adopt you as... our child. Would you like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, even Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their child?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rubbed his nose but ultimately remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Autumn was also stunned. She looked at Clarissa and then at Osborne, her eyes flickering with excitement but mostly filled with fear and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Me, really me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa smiled, patting her little head. "Of course, sweetie. From now on, you'll be our child, Osborne's and mine. How does that sound?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Autumn blushed, hesitating for a moment before she asked, "So you won't force me to sell flowers on the streets? I'll be able to eat every day, right? You won't hit me, will you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's heart ached as she shook her head vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! We won't lay a finger on you, and no one else will dare to either. From now on, you can do whatever you want and eat whatever you desire."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Autumn became even more excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She uttered shyly, "Mom... Mom."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, my dear daughter!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa responded quickly, tears streaming down her face once more. She enveloped Autumn in her arms, holding her close with utmost tenderness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa, in reality, was just a young woman of twenty, but the moment Autumn called her </span><span>Mom</span><span>, Osborne felt she transformed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes, when gazing at Autumn, brimmed with affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A maternal glow radiated from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew Clarissa wasn't joking. She truly considered Autumn as her own child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rubbed his nose, feeling a bit awkward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Clarissa and I now have a child? An eight-year-old? Clarissa is just twenty, and I'm only twenty-five! Well, as long as Clarissa is happy! And adopting a child is a breeze for me now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this thought, Osborne also smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened his arms wide and laughed. "Autumn, come here and let Dad hold you too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Autumn was a bit shy, still feeling some unease and grievance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But under Clarissa's encouraging gaze, she ran up and leaped into Osborne's arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daddy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, my daughter!" Osborne quickly responded, holding her frail body and suddenly feeling a sense of responsibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at that moment, the roar of a sports car suddenly sounded, rapidly approaching, followed by a luxurious vehicle speeding into the park, coming to a halt just outside the grove.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tall figure stepped out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a man in his late twenties with a stern gaze and a haughty demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the heir to the Luther family, Wallace!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing Wallace, Gavin immediately seemed to see a savior, crying out for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Luther, I'm here! Save me! Please save me! The Hummingbird Gang is finished. All of our members have been killed by him! He's the devil!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
