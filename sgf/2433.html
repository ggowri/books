  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sound, like the beating of war drums, came faintly from the depths of the Dimensional Microcosm. If Osborne didn&rsquo;t listen carefully, he would hardly notice it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But once he heard it for the first time, he could no longer ignore the sound.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Osborne felt his heartbeat change rhythm, beating in sync with the drum-like sound.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation surprised him greatly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, his body showed no abnormalities. Otherwise, he would have left immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Primordial, what is this sound?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had now gotten used to asking Primordial first whenever he encountered something he didn't understand. If Primordial couldn't answer, then he would explore further.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial transformed into a little tree spirit and landed on Osborne's shoulder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't answer directly but asked, "You say this sound can affect your heartbeat? Are you sure?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial is a tree. He doesn't have an organ like a heart, so the sound doesn't affect him, but after getting Osborne's answer, he became excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, you might have stumbled upon a treasure again!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Primordial in surprise. "What treasure? Will it help me improve my strength?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial gave a mysterious smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Whether it helps or not, I can't say for sure yet! However, this thing shouldn't pose any threat to you. Get a little closer now. I need to analyze it further to confirm if my guess is correct."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He trusted Primordial quite a lot. Since Primordial said there was no threat, it should be safe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, his Satan's Eye didn't react to the drum-like sound, which meant there was no danger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne called Flash and prepared to take a closer look.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Flash was feasting. In the blink of an eye, he had devoured an entire patch of Ethereal Blooms, at least a few hundred of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were worth hundreds of thousands of Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was speechless at this moment. Flash was powerful and loyal, making him a strong ally, but his appetite was just too enormous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, Flash had to eat several Beast Soul Flowers every day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, he had devoured hundreds of Ethereal Blooms in one go, and these were precious resources.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was equivalent to Flash consuming millions worth of Sacred Crystals every day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ordinary people really couldn't afford to keep him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At Osborne's call, Flash finally gave up eating more Ethereal Blooms and carried him deeper into the Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Flash clearly didn't feel any threat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne asked him how he reacted to the drum-like sound. However, Flash shook his head, indicating he felt nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was instantly puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Flash also has a heart, so why wasn't he affected?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this drum-like sound only affecting me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Or does it only affect the Spirit Clan, but not the Beast Clan or Plant Clan?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was unsure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he looked at the group of Ice Beetles gathered not far away and couldn't help wanting to rush over and wipe them all out...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There are at least nearly ten million Ice Beetles in this small world!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he wiped them all out, he'd strike it rich!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne ultimately held back his impulse. He wanted to figure out the situation of this Dimensional Microcosm before taking action. At the very least, he needed to understand the drum-like sound and the treasure Primordial mentioned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, many Ice Beetles also noticed him, but they didn&rsquo;t attack him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, they were all devoutly moving toward the center of the small world, ignoring the outside situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, Flash carried Osborne over a massive snowy mountain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne saw what was behind the snowy mountain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he froze, his eyes wide with shock. He almost turned around and ran.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because he saw something incredibly terrifying!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's Ice Beetles...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, they weren't ordinary Ice Beetles. They were ten times larger! Their crystal-like bodies shimmered with a faint silver glow, and the aura around them was utterly terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That is Empyrean Sacredness!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What Osborne saw at this moment turned out to be the Empyrean Sacredness's Ice Beetles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And it was a massive swarm!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Behind the snowy mountain was a massive basin. There, countless Empyrean Sacredness's Ice Beetles, like patrolling warriors, were flying around a wooden building at the center of the basin.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were at least several thousand of them!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Osborne almost turned and ran in fear. No matter how confident he was, he knew he couldn't take on thousands of Empyrean Sacredness Ice Beetles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even with Flash, they couldn't defeat those Ice Beetles!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn&rsquo;t turn and run because he noticed that these Empyrean Sacredness Ice Beetles didn&rsquo;t show any hostility toward him. They seemed to just be maintaining order. As long as Osborne didn&rsquo;t act recklessly, they wouldn&rsquo;t attack him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne muttered, "Good thing I didn&rsquo;t attack those ordinary Ice Beetles earlier! If I had, I might have alarmed these Empyrean Sacredness Ice Beetles and faced their siege!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is thousands of Empyrean Sacredness Ice Beetles. Even if they are all primary Empyrean Sacredness, they could probably easily surround and kill an advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior! After all, Ice Beetles have strong defenses. And an advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior would likely find it hard to easily kill primary Empyrean Sacredness Ice Beetles..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But soon, he frowned again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But why are there so many Empyrean Sacredness Ice Beetles here? Aren't Ice Beetles a lower-tier Bug Clan? Their racial limit prevents them from reaching Empyrean Sacredness! The moment they approach Empyrean Sacredness, they immediately die..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Maybe a few Ice Beetles occasionally surpass their racial limits and reach Empyrean Sacredness. After all, anything is possible! But here, there are thousands of Empyrean Sacredness Ice Beetles!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Did so many surpass their racial limits at the same time?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt that something was off.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Primordial on his shoulder got excited upon seeing so many Empyrean Sacredness Ice Beetles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, now I'm even more certain of my guess!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go, hurry </span><span>up</span><span>! You're in for another stroke of luck this time!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial pointed at the wooden structure in the basin, urging Osborne to move forward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne also noticed that the drum-like sound was coming from the wooden structure. At this moment, none of the Ice Beetles dared to approach it easily, not even the Empyrean Sacredness Ice Beetles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Primordial, are you sure there won't be any danger?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Whatever's in that wooden structure must be important to these Ice Beetles. These Empyrean Sacredness Ice Beetles are clearly guarding it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you sure that approaching rashly won't anger them and get us swarmed?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial smiled confidently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry! If anyone else came here and tried to approach that wooden structure, they'd definitely be swarmed! But you're different!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You have a connection with whatever's in that wooden structure!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, these Ice Beetles definitely won't attack you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Is that so?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in the end, Osborne chose to trust Primordial. He rode Flash and cautiously approached.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gradually, Osborne felt the drum-like sound becoming clearer, and even his heartbeat grew stronger.</span></p><div class="pagination">
