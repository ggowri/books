  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne unleashed the Thunderform Flash, he couldn't resist taunting Fabian, "I'm dead? You've said that three times now! Yet here we are, and you haven't even managed to graze my cloak. Is boasting a requirement for the Wild Bull Clan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian's fury flared at Osborne's words, but he was powerless to respond. Despite activating his secret technique to boost his speed, he could barely keep up with Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catching Osborne was out of the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting his teeth, he silently waited for the moment Osborne's divine power would finally run dry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd watched with bated breath, all eager for that moment of exhaustion to arrive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were growing tired of this endless chase, but little did they know their hopes would be dashed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waiting for Osborne to tire wouldn't happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had the Infinite Devouring Eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Positioned deep within the No. 9 mining area, they constantly absorbed vast amounts of energy, not only fueling his cultivation but also replenishing his divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Infinite Devouring Eyes at his disposal, he could unleash his full speed without a worry about running out of divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, he was merely tapping into his speed; he hadn't even begun to fight at full strength. While using Thunderform Flash would typically drain a lot of divine power for others, for Osborne, it felt like a walk in the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this scenario, how could he ever exhaust his divine power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless Fabian could somehow double his speed again, Osborne had nothing to fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could easily outlast Fabian's resolve, and that wasn't just idle talk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the chase continued, time slipped by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten minutes passed, and Osborne still showed no signs of fatigue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers were awestruck, marveling at Osborne as a rare talent among the younger generation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when twelve minutes ticked by, and Osborne remained unfazed, shock rippled through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then came fifteen minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, everyone was left speechless, staring at Osborne as he maintained his effortless speed, his expression relaxed, with no hint of divine power depletion. They were all dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One person couldn't help but murmur, "How is this even possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A technique this powerful? Most Celestial Deity warriors at the early stage would be lucky to last five minutes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And he's still going strong after fifteen? His divine power must be three times that of an average early-stage Celestial Deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I doubt even a mid-stage Celestial Deity could match his reserves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a monster!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the crowd was indeed astonished, they still didn't take it seriously. Even if Osborne's divine power was three times that of his peers, he would eventually fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian, now thoroughly enraged, refused to back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you! Let's see how long you can keep this up! The more of a genius you are, the more I'll relish taking you down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian roared, his pride wounded after fifteen minutes of failing to even touch Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His anger boiled over, and he decided it was time to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Fabian wasn't going to focus his attacks on just his fists; he would unleash a wide-range assault to engulf Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this precarious situation, Osborne found himself in an even more dangerous position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Fabian's Deity Overlord strength, he could easily reduce half of Wild Flame City to rubble if he chose to. His divine power attacks could cover over 100 miles, making it increasingly difficult for Osborne to evade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determined to land a hit, Fabian expanded his attack range, forcing Osborne to dodge with greater difficulty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne quickly devised a plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He began darting around the nearby buildings, using them as shields. Each time Fabian unleashed a wide-area attack, it would inadvertently slam into the structures. While these buildings had divine power defenses, they were no match for a Deity Overlord's might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, one building was struck by Fabian's divine power attack, collapsing under the force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne barely managed to escape unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fabian! Stop this at once!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thunderous voice suddenly boomed, and a massive figure rushed in from the distance, blocking Fabian's path with a grim expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian's face paled as he recognized the newcomer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The City Guard is here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whispers spread through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's Oswald Borden from the Fero Tiger Clan! He's a general in the City Guard! A fellow Deity Overlord warrior, and even stronger than Fabian! It looks like the City Guard can't stand by while he fights in Wild Flame City."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oswald, don't get in my way! I have to kill this lowly human today!" Fabian shouted, his anger boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oswald snorted dismissively. "Fabian! Enough! This is the inner city of Wild Flame City. Your battle has already caused significant damage to the buildings. If you don't stop now, I'll have to take action on behalf of the City Guard!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian's fury surged at the words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glared at Osborne, who was watching him with a mocking grin, his eyes filled with resentment.</span></p><div class="pagination">
