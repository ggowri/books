  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne! Come out! I know you are in there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of the way. I'm looking for Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, come out! If you're still a man, come out right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense cries and shouts reached Osborne's ears through the crack in the door, causing his face to instantly darken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was very familiar with this voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Evelyn's voice!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ma'am, please stop making noise here and leave immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn became angrier and angrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, come out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the door cracked open, and Osborne emerged with a cold face. He immediately spotted two security guards on the ship gripping Evelyn's arms and trying to take her away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight of him, she struggled even more violently in annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hand, signaling for the security guards to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon being released, Evelyn swiftly rushed to him excitedly, trembling and attempting to grab his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a frown, Osborne turned slightly sideways to avoid her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She staggered and almost fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, "Evelyn, if you dare to touch me, I promise to throw you into the sea! You can try it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn froze and bit her lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued with a snort, "Tell me, why are you yelling outside my room? If you can't give a reason, I will still throw you into the sea."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed quite aloof.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chill washed over Evelyn. The excitement she had previously felt had vanished without a trace. She gazed at Osborne in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she remained silent, he became impatient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have anything to tell me? If not, get out of here right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn trembled again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She finally remembered why she came to Osborne. With tears in her eyes, she replied, "Yes! I have something to tell you! Ophelia... S-She is dying! Osborne, please save her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn was in a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his eyebrows. Only then did he notice the faint bloodstains on her clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What happened?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that Ophelia was so depressed that she committed suicide?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, it couldn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be due to the attack last night?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several VIPs were injured or killed during that incident. Could Ophelia have been one of them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne remained unmoved and replied indifferently, "Is Ophelia dying? What does that have to do with me? Everyone will die, and it's just a matter of time. I've told you that I have nothing to do with you or her anymore. Please, don't bother me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If she is dead, I'm so sorry. Regardless of the circumstances, it happens on the cruise ship of the Augustine family, so I will compensate you appropriately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne prepared to enter the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Evelyn became anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne! You can't just walk away. How can you be so heartless? Ophelia was once your wife. Even if she made mistakes, how could you stand by and watch her die impassively?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn still shook violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled coldly, "Heartless? So what? Given everything you've done to me, do you still expect me to show you mercy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am kind enough not to kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes were bloodshot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, it dawned on him that the miserable and shameful past, which he thought he no longer cared about, would still irritate him when it was brought up again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!" Evelyn yelled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She begged, "Osborne, we were wrong. We already knew we were wrong! Please save Ophelia, okay? Everything is my fault. If it hadn't been for my instigation, she wouldn't have divorced you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Throughout your three years at the Caldwell Estate, I was the one primarily targeting you. It had nothing to do with Ophelia. If punishment is what you seek, just punish me. Even if it means my death, I will have no objection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But, Osborne, Ophelia is still young!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you just going to watch her die? She came to you intentionally! It was a brave decision to seek you out, to apologize in person, and to plead for your forgiveness. She truly regrets her actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, even if you don't forgive her, please save her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn wept sadly before Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa, Kendra, Ryan, Nathan, and the others, who had been startled by her crying and shouting earlier, lay quietly near the cracked doors of their rooms, listening in secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Evelyn begging him, he felt a profound sense of frustration rather than the expected satisfaction of revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did Ophelia and Evelyn follow him here to harass him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why was it Ophelia who got hurt in last night's attack?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did Evelyn have the nerve to plead with him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why couldn't he completely seal up his painful and shameful experiences?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears instantly welled up in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He closed his eyes tightly, trying hard to suppress his anger. Everyone could feel that he was on the verge of losing control at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, he suddenly opened his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said icily, "I'm not a doctor, and I can't save her!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
