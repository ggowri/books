  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's face lit up with admiration. "Almost everyone has to admit that the God of Night is the second greatest warrior in Celestara, right after Lord Malevolence! And he has another nickname..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What nickname?" the others asked, intrigued by this legendary figure from the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's cheeks flushed slightly as she continued, "They call him Celestara's Handsomest Man!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've heard that several of the female Deity Kings from the Human Community</span><span>, </span><span>like the God of Light, God of Life, God of Time, God of Space, and God of Destiny</span><span>, </span><span>were all infatuated with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But apparently, he turned them all down, and because of that, they vowed never to marry and have been waiting for him ever since.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's got to say something about how good-looking he is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression darkened at this revelation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Celestara's Handsomest Man? What kind of gossip is that? Let's stick to serious topics, shall we?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, Zoe, Mila, and Kendra couldn't help but chuckle at Osborne's reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia teased, "Osborne, we think this is quite serious! Hannah, tell us more. Is God of Night really that handsome? How does he compare to Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a playful glance at Osborne, Anastasia leaned in closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah laughed lightly. "I've never actually seen God of Night, so I can't say for sure! But he's probably close, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia burst into laughter. "Oh! So, in your eyes, Osborne is also Celestara's Handsomest Man?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group erupted into laughter, enjoying the light-hearted banter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Bryce maintained a serious demeanor. "If Osborne is Celestara's Handsomest Man, then I must be the second!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, right!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girls laughed again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne coughed to regain their attention. "Alright, let's get back to business!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hannah, you mentioned that God of Night was severely injured by the Shadow Terror Fiend? There are rumors that he has fallen and hasn't shown his face in decades? Is that true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah nodded gravely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's what the rumors say!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And God of Night hasn't made any appearances to clarify things. I've heard..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated, her brow furrowing as if she were unsure whether to continue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What have you heard? Don't hold back," Osborne urged, leaning forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah bit her lip, gathering her thoughts. "I've heard that the Paramount Supreme Clan, after some probing, is increasingly convinced that God of Night has indeed fallen! Many of the more aggressive factions within the clan are eager to launch a large-scale attack on the West Zone Human Community</span><span> and</span><span> aim to wipe them out completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If God of Night really is gone, then the Human Community is in deep trouble! The God of Light alone won't be able to protect them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All we can do is hope these rumors are false!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If God of Night were still around, his mere presence would deter the Paramount Supreme Clan from launching a full-scale war</span><span>. U</span><span>nless Lord Malevolence himself got involved."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned serious at Hannah's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood that the Paramount Supreme Clan was indeed planning a full-scale war against the West Zone Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that the God of Night had likely fallen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the only top-tier Deity King warrior left to lead the Human Community in the West Zone was the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Relying solely on the God of Light wouldn't be enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Lord Malevolence didn't intervene, the Nine Dark Sovereigns and their Dark Deity Legions would be more than a match for the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a heavy sigh, Osborne felt the weight of the situation pressing down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah said, "Alright, let's move on from the God of Night for now. Speaking of which, there's been a rising superstar warrior in the West Zone Human Community who's becoming quite well-known. She has some connection to the God of Night."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's statement piqued everyone's curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is she?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah replied, "Her name is Isa Bowin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seriously?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's revelation left Osborne, Anastasia, and the others momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all turned to Osborne, who was visibly tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah looked at them in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know Isa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't respond directly but instead asked, "It could be a coincidence! Can you tell me more about this Isa? Is she the new superstar warrior?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing Osborne's urgency, Hannah nodded quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Twenty years ago, Isa burst onto the scene in the West Zone battlefield. She single-handedly fought the Icy Six to a standstill, even managing to injure him! From that moment, she became a legend throughout Celestara. Unfortunately, after a few battles, she vanished without a trace and hasn't been seen in quite some time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression went blank as the implications sank in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty years ago!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Isa's timeline matched perfectly with when the Isa he had been longing for left Blue Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Could it be that Hannah is talking about the very same Isa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is she the God of Night's disciple?" he asked, his heart racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah nodded. "Yes! But she's more than just his disciple; she's also the God of Night's woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
