  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued to draw energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, urging his space elemental essence to absorb its powerful core energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this deep space, time had become an abstract concept.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had no idea how long he had been here, but it felt like an eternity. Yet, there was no point in fretting; impatience wouldn't help him escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he could do was wait patiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his space elemental essence rapidly absorbed the core energy, he divided his focus, also working to enhance his dark elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The progress was slow, but any improvement was better than none.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time slipped away, and before he knew it, all three core energies from the Primordial Crimson Lotus had been consumed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he had anticipated, his space elemental essence had only reached the late Level Six, still a significant distance from its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like I'll need at least three or four more core energies from the Lotus to break through to Level Seven," he thought, biting his lip in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his essence upgraded to late Level Six, the deep space around him no longer felt like an endless void. It resembled a moonless night&mdash;still dim, but he could see a bit more clearly now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, there was nothing around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Osborne felt no threat from the spatial tide, not because his Divine Body had grown stronger but because his spatial power had intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could even influence the flow of the tide with a mere thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His spatial power had skyrocketed beyond what it once was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, despite this newfound strength, he still had no clue how to escape this deep space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He muttered, determination etched on his face, "Looks like I'll have to keep extracting core energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I don't push my space elemental essence to Level Seven, I won't be able to leave!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity! I know how crucial those core energies are to you, but I'm in a tight spot and have to keep borrowing from you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that resolve, Osborne activated the Breath of Celestial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like before, he harnessed the Breath of Celestial to draw core energy from the Lotus, pulling one energy after another from its body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One wasn't enough, so he continued until he had extracted five core energies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when he took the fifth core energy, the Primordial Crimson Lotus suddenly trembled violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed to weaken and become somewhat translucent from the loss of so much energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, its blooming petals snapped shut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the...?!" Osborne gasped, panic rising in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly halted his extraction, staring in horror at the closed petals of the Lotus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression darkened as he realized that his Dimensional Microcosm had previously been resting on those very petals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with the petals closed, the Microcosm was completely enveloped, severing his connection to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do I do now? Is the Dimensional Microcosm going to </span><span>be</span><span> okay? What about Grandpa, Anastasia, and the others in there? Damn it! If I had known this would happen, I wouldn't have extracted so much energy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frantic, Osborne felt utterly helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he tried using the Breath of Celestial again, he couldn't re-establish contact with the Lotus to release the Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath, trying to calm his racing thoughts. "It'll be okay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity is just low on core energy. Once it replenishes, it'll bloom again. Its petals are enveloping the Dimensional Microcosm, making it even safer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I just need to focus on leveling up my space elemental essence to Level Seven and get the hell out of here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that resolve, Osborne dove back into his meditation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After absorbing another surge of the Lotus' core energy, his space elemental essence </span><span>finally reached the peak of Level Six, teetering on the brink of a breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, his dark elemental essence, through natural cultivation, had quietly advanced to Level Six mid-stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Phew, almost there," he murmured, his voice tinged with relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he prepared to push forward, a jolt of anxiety shot through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes snapped open, scanning the dim recesses of deep spatial. Osborne felt a prickling sensation, as if something&mdash;or someone&mdash;was watching him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart pounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell? Something's watching me? That can't be right. This is deep space; nothing but raging spatial tides. What could be out there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression grew somber, but the shock was just beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity within him began to tremble violently, as if gripped by fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? What could possibly be spooking the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is a Cosmic Treasure we're talking about!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
