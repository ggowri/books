  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Five days flew by in a whirlwind of challenges and fierce competition.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Every morning, Clarissa and Emma took to the arena, welcoming challengers with open arms.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At first, they breezed through their opponents, as the true heavyweights of the Godson Rankings usually didn't show up until two days before the Honor Quest Ceremony.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Both Emma and Clarissa had the strength to rank within the top three hundred.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They showcased their prowess by easily defeating one challenger after another.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But as the days wore on, the challengers grew stronger, and soon, the duo found themselves pushed to their limits. They had to pull out some tricks to stay ahead of the game.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Throughout this grueling process, both women were rapidly evolving. Their skills sharpened, and their combat experience expanded.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today, Clarissa faced off against Satoru, a formidable opponent who had once attempted to break into the Godson Rankings during Cuthbert's Honor Quest Ceremony.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although he had ultimately failed, his power was undeniable, especially with his mastery of the Dark Realm.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa had already fought over a dozen battles, and exhaustion was etched on her face. Sweat glistened on her brow as she struggled to keep her Divine and Demonic Wings steady against Satoru's relentless onslaught.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The wings trembled, on the verge of collapse, and it was clear to everyone that Clarissa was nearing her breaking point.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she bit her lip, refusing to give in.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa didn't want to lose!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After five days of fierce competition, she had felt the weight of Emma's strength.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a Class AA, she was at a disadvantage in this contest, but the thought of defeat was unacceptable.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa shouted, her voice filled with fierce determination, "Submit to me! Wail of Fate!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa summoned the Fate Staff, unleashing a devastating psychic attack that rippled through the air like a shockwave, piercing Satoru's ears and striking at his very soul.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah!" Satoru screamed, blood streaming from his ears as he collapsed to the ground.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gasping for breath, Clarissa felt her body reach its limits.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was only afternoon, and hours remained before the day's battles would conclude.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She glanced over at Emma, who was also feeling the strain but appeared to be in much better shape thanks to her Class AAA status.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's strength was solid, allowing her to endure the exhausting combat longer.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Am I really going to lose?" Clarissa whispered, a sense of frustration bubbling within her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma watched Clarissa with a hint of envy. Despite being only Class AA, Clarissa's performance was impressive, and Emma couldn't help but admire her talent.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Clarissa were Class AAA, Emma knew she wouldn't stand a chance.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma thought, "Clarissa, I'm sorry!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I know this might feel unfair, but I have to win! I love Osborne, too, and I want to be with him openly!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With determination igniting in her eyes, Emma shouted, "Who else wants to challenge me? Step up!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The challenges continued.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, deep within the Augustine family's sacred grounds, Mount Celestial Reach, four shadowy figures suddenly materialized, their presence unnoticed by anyone.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They exuded an air of arrogance as they surveyed their surroundings, cold smirks appearing on their faces.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a flash, another figure appeared.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was Wesson. His expression was icy, his gaze fixed on the newcomers with a mix of apprehension and seriousness.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson barked, "Everett! Rumen!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you doing here?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is the Augustine family's restricted zone. You need to leave! Now!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson's eyes narrowed, his stance unwavering as he confronted the two intruders.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Among the newcomers was Everett, the head of the Rosenthal family, a member of Yalynch's Divine Family. He was no stranger to the Augustine family, having previously lost two divine artifacts to the Godfather.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next to him stood an even more formidable figure.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was Rumen.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the head of the most powerful Divine Family in Marcelin, Rumen also served as one of the vice leaders of the League of Divine Descent. His strength was unparalleled, and he even ranked higher than both Sebastian and Gerardo on the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Both Everett and Rumen were top-tier Class S powerhouses.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson felt a heavy weight settle on his shoulders as he regarded the two.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, his attention soon shifted to the young pair standing behind Rumen&mdash;a man and a woman.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Osborne had been there, he would have recognized the woman immediately: it was Ebony, the one he had taught a lesson to.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man beside her was her brother, Marlon.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everett cast a dismissive glance at Wesson. "Wesson, we're here to see Sebastian. You're just his butler; you don't have the authority to host us.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Step aside and let Sebastian come out."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everett's tone was full of arrogance as he completely dismissed Wesson, eyes filled with contempt.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson's fists clenched at the disrespect.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Godfather is currently in seclusion and isn't receiving visitors. You'll need to leave."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Seclusion? More like he's still nursing his wounds!" Everett shot back, a smirk creeping onto his face.</p><div class="pagination">
