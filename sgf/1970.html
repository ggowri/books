  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Binding Twin Pearl suddenly pulsed with an unusual energy. Osborne focused intently, and it became clear that something had gone horribly wrong with his grandfather, Jethro.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The essence of Jethro was rapidly weakening, a sure sign that he had been gravely injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were just a minor wound, the pearl wouldn't react so violently. Osborne's expression darkened as he realized the severity of the situation. Without hesitation, he prepared to activate the Binding Twin Pearl and teleport to Jethro's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't allow anything to happen to him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could act, Zachary and the others moved quickly to block his path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, don't be rash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your grandpa specifically instructed us that if anything went wrong, you must not use the Binding Twin Pearl to teleport! If he can't handle the situation, what can you possibly do? You'd just be walking into a death trap!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary, Alicia, and the others held onto Osborne tightly, refusing to let him activate the pearl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a surge of urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uncle Zachary! Please, don't stop me! Grandpa is in danger, and I'm bound to the Binding Twin Pearl! I'm the only one who can teleport to him and save him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way!" Zachary insisted firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all worried about Jethro and wished they could be by his side to understand what was happening, but their greater concern was for Osborne's safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro had achieved the rank of Ascension Three Supernal Deity King before leaving the Hudson family for the Sanctum of Light. If even he was in trouble, it meant his opponent was likely at least an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King, or even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sending Osborne into that situation would be tantamount to handing him a death sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you need to calm down. We can figure this out together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head vigorously. "There's no time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, he felt an even more intense surge from the Binding Twin Pearl, indicating that Jethro's situation had become increasingly dire. His life was in jeopardy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew he couldn't wait any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uncle Zachary, I'm sorry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a tremendous force erupted from him, sending Zachary, Alicia, and the others flying back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their own breakthroughs to Supernal Deity King, they felt like infants being pushed away by a powerful adult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were powerless to stop him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their shock, Osborne wasted no time and activated the Binding Twin Pearl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pearl enveloped him in a radiant light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne! Stop!" Zachary shouted, panic evident in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uncle Zachary, wait for my good news!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll bring Grandpa back safely! Whoever is after him will pay dearly!" Osborne declared before vanishing in an instant, teleported away by the Binding Twin Pearl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in a jungle just six million miles away from the Hudson Valley, Jethro struggled to rise from the wreckage around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He coughed violently, blood spilling from his mouth, mixed with fragments of internal injuries. A grim smile crossed his face as he looked down at the massive gaping wound in his chest, feeling the life force slipping away painfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro forced himself to look up at the two figures hovering in the air above him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recognized them both.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One was Trevor, a Supernal Deity King from the Baxter family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it wasn't Trevor who had dealt him this crushing blow. After all, Trevor was merely an Ascension One Supernal Deity King, hardly a match for Jethro's Ascension Three status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The one who had truly injured him was the man standing next to Trevor&mdash;Bram Baxter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bram, the Supernal Deity King of the Baxter family, had been a formidable force over a hundred years ago, reaching the rank of Ascension Three Supernal Deity King and standing as the family's top warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, twenty years ago, the Baxter family had announced that Bram had met his end while on a mission at the border, cornered by one of Lord Malevolence's minions, Icy Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They claimed he had self-destructed to avoid capture, and the family held an extravagant memorial service in his honor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Bram had returned&mdash;not only alive but having broken through to Ascension Four Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Jethro returned from the Sanctum of Light, he found himself ambushed by Bram and severely injured in the surprise attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fury ignited in Jethro's eyes as he glared at Bram. "Bram, so you're still alive! Twenty years ago, when the Baxter family claimed you died at the hands of Icy Six, I found it hard to believe. Turns out, you faked your death! The Baxter family has truly betrayed the Human Community and allied with Lord Malevolence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bram smirked coldly. "Jethro, you're a bit late to the party! As for betrayal? Where do you get that idea? We all know the Paramount Supreme Clan is part of the Human Community. The Baxter family siding with Lord Malevolence is just a wise move&mdash;an adaptation to the times!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we don't align with Lord Malevolence, are we supposed to wait for his Dark Deity Legion to wipe us out? If the Hudson family wants to throw their lives away, that's on them, but the Baxter family has no interest in that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community in the West Zone is doomed to be destroyed by Lord Malevolence's forces. Those who resist will perish. Only the smart ones&mdash;those who join Lord Malevolence early&mdash;will survive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bram's expression was mocking as he continued, "Right now, I'm offering you a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lead the Hudson family to pledge allegiance to Lord Malevolence, and not only will you survive, but your entire family will too! Once the Dark Deity Legion takes over the West Zone, the Hudson family will be seen as heroes, with a higher status than you have now..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Bram could finish, Jethro interrupted him with a roar, his eyes burning with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut your mouth! Even if the Hudson family is wiped out, we will never betray the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We will never become Lord Malevolence's lapdogs!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you have the guts, just kill me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if I die, the Hudson family will continue to fight against the Dark Deity Legion! Even if there's only one of us left, as long as we can wield a weapon, we'll keep swinging our swords against the Dark Deity Legion until the end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro's eyes blazed with determination, his voice sharp as a blade, cutting through Bram and Trevor's facade and leaving them visibly shaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor sneered, saying, "Ha! Old man, shouting like that when death is knocking at your door&mdash;do you really think that shows your loyalty to the Human Community? It won't matter; no one will hear you, and no one is coming to save you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for killing you? Oh, we will, but not yet. You still have value! Now, kindly tell us where the Seven Young Deity Kings of the Human Community are hiding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you cooperate and lead us to the Seven Young Deity Kings, we might just give you a quick end. Otherwise, we'll have to take matters into our own hands. We have plenty of ways to make you obedient and turn you into our little pet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Trevor finished, Jethro's expression hardened dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, your real target with this ambush was the Seven Young Deity Kings of the Human Community?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
