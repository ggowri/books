  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seemed that you all wanted to kill me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt the seriousness of the situation but appeared calm and indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> sent someone to hold Serena back and even dispatched people to </span><span>Likreia</span><span> Mountain to prevent Bryce from leaving easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They did this to ensure that Bryce and Serena would not come to save Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were determined to kill Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris sneered,&nbsp;"Of course. You have Satan's Eye, so your relationship with the Godfather is definitely not as simple as it seems. Besides, your growth is too fast. If we kill you now, we will have one less formidable enemy in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted,&nbsp;"Why didn't you act sooner? You should have been here for a while, yet you just watched as I killed them all?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris shrugged. "They were just a bunch of useless people. It doesn't matter that they died. Moreover, their deaths weren't without value. At least they consumed your power and allowed us to see your true strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In that case, it will be even easier for us to kill you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression changed.&nbsp;"You are truly cruel. They had already sided with you, yet you treated them as cannon fodder."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They deserved to be."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris said with a cold smile,&nbsp;"Enough chatter. It's time for you to die. Don't think you can stall for time waiting for someone to rescue you. This time, no one can save you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback. Chris saw through his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was indeed trying to buy time for Bryce to arrive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Bryce had promised him, he would certainly find a way to come. Unless the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> personally intercepted Bryce at </span><span>Likreia</span><span> Mountain, Bryce would surely solve the problem and come quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he needed to do was buy time for Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Chris did not give Osborne that time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris looked at Bruce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bruce, will you take action, or shall I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruce smiled,&nbsp;"I am more interested in </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span>. Although her level is still low, she possesses divine artifacts, making her a decent opponent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris raised an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then you deal with </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span>. But remember, you must not kill her. Otherwise, we will all be in trouble. Just capture her alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruce smiled,&nbsp;"Don't worry, I know what to do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Bruce focused on Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said with a smile,&nbsp;"Little girl, fight me. Don't worry, I won't kill you, nor would I dare to. If you don't want to see Chris and me teaming up against your man, fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Clarissa bit her lip tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gripped the Fate Staff firmly, her expression serious yet without any fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She already knew that Bruce and Chris were powerful, and if Osborne were to be besieged by them, it would be extremely dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had to help Osborne bear the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, be careful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment but nodded.&nbsp;"Clarissa, be careful, too. I will shut him down as soon as possible to help you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa nodded and flapped her Divine and Demonic Wings. Her body soared into the air like an angel, landing before Bruce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruce's eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What pure power! No wonder the great King feared you so much, wanting to eliminate you before you grew stronger. Unfortunately, he failed. By the time you grow, he won't allow us to act against you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, let me see what makes you so special."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Bruce spoke, he swung his staff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa declared firmly,&nbsp;"I won't let you down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the two began to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruce obviously did not use his full strength. He was more in a probing mode. He seemed wary of Clarissa's power, not daring to make contact, fearing contamination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, even if Clarissa had the Fate Staff, she would not be his match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Clarissa had only reached Class B.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Alexander, after unleashing his full power, was able to suppress Clarissa, let alone Class AA Bruce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Clarissa was temporarily safe, Osborne turned to Chris.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris was also watching him, wearing a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wielded the black sickle and said,&nbsp;"I heard that when Satan's Eye reaches level five, it can unleash mental attacks, greatly enhancing resistance. I wonder how many blows from my Death Sickle you can withstand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted,&nbsp;"You'll find out when you try."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let's try."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris smiled. The wind howled as he abruptly raised the Death Sickle and swiftly swung it at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strange black energy exploded from the Death Sickle, heading straight for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That black energy was the mental attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attack was so fast that even Serena couldn't evade it. Therefore, Osborne did not believe he could dodge it either. Satan's Eye erupted with bright light, preparing to withstand the mental assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even so, when the attack truly arrived, Osborne couldn't help but change his expression drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, he felt a terrifying force slicing through his soul and spirit. His mind thundered, leaving him somewhat dazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, Osborne spat out a mouthful of blood, and his face turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris had only swung the Death Sickle once, and Osborne was already severely injured.</span></p><div class="pagination">
