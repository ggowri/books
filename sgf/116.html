  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin and Barlyn were ecstatic, practically dancing with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One was the young master of an ancient family, the other the successor of a top-tier dynasty. For them, 240 million dollars was not a staggering amount.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the fact that they had made this sum in just half a day felt like a windfall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earning 240 million by themselves, compared to earning the same amount through a family business, gave them a much greater sense of accomplishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This experience would give them plenty to brag about for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was equally pleased. His wealth had grown significantly today. He had first raided Davy's vault, making 480 million, then earned another 320 million in the diamond dealing market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In total, that amounted to 800 million!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adding this to the 600 million already in his account, his wealth - excluding Luna Jewelry - had exceeded one billion, reaching a staggering one point four billion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this was all in cash!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Typically, wealthy families like the Caldwell family had assets of around 1 billion, but only a fraction of that was cash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's liquid assets alone surpassed the Caldwell family's entire fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison efficiently handled the payment and arranged for the diamonds to be transported to Luna Jewelry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, Luna Jewelry didn't have this much cash on hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its scale was similar to the Caldwell Group - plenty of assets but only about 500 million in cash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, with a recent influx of high-end diamonds, including several Imperial Greens, the company had received a flood of custom orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deposit alone had amounted to 500 million, and it was still increasing daily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after paying 800 million, Luna Jewelry had enough left to operate smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison said, "Mr. Augustine, I'm heading out now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. With me running things at Luna Jewelry, there's no risk. We'll soon become the biggest jewelry company in Mayby City, and even Skyefall."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alison left in a hurry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin said, grinning, "I didn't realize Luna Jewelry was your venture, Osborne. From now on, whenever I buy jewelry, it'll be from Luna Jewelry! And I'll definitely recommend it to my friends and family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up. "Thank you, Austin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn chimed in, "Same here! Whenever I get married, or if my friends do, we'll be going to Osborne's Luna Jewelry for sure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's smile widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His goal in making money with them was to expand his network.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Born a commoner orphan, he had money now, but his network was still his weak spot. Building relationships with people like Barlyn and Austin was invaluable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia and Wesley were like lapdogs fawning over Clarissa, hoping to develop her into a valuable contact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's approach was different; he wasn't interested in groveling to build his network.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Networking was all about friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>True friends were equals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unequal relationships were merely utilitarian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said sincerely, "I appreciate you both."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Expanding my network is also a way to secure my future. The challenges for the Godfather's successor are growing more difficult and dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I might not complete all the trials.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By building my network now, even if I fail to become the Godfather's successor, I'll have a fallback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these connections, I can still thrive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn said earnestly, "We should be thanking you, Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And now, I don't have to worry about my mom controlling my finances anymore! I can do whatever I want and drink whenever I want! Ha!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go celebrate! Drinks are on me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn was in high spirits, having raked in 440 million that day. With an air of exuberance, he decided to treat Osborne and Austin to an extravagant night out at the most lavish places in town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, neither Osborne nor Austin could refuse Barlyn's generous offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trio spent the entire evening living it up, and it wasn't until midnight that they finally called it a night. After setting a date for their next get-together, they each headed home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne returned to the Institute of Human Research.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He first checked on his sister, Anastasia, and found </span><span>Isa</span><span> there, conducting a routine examination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's doing quite well," </span><span>Isa</span><span> said with a reassuring tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a sigh of relief. "</span><span>Dr. Bowin</span><span>, I owe you big time for what you did this morning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa</span><span> smiled, "Why thank me? I did get paid, after all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head. "At first, I thought two million was a steep price, but now I realize it was a bargain. Anyway, thanks again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa</span><span> raised an eyebrow in surprise. "You know about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She brushed a stray lock of hair behind her ear and continued, "No need to be so formal. Helping you out was just a side benefit. The Class C+ wind-controlling metahuman - that's my little extra."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's interest was piqued. "Pamela, right? Where is she now? I've got some questions for her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had long been curious about why the Aberrants were so determined to take down Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He figured Pamela might hold the key to the answers he was seeking.</span></p><div class="pagination">
