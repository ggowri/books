  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The purple Thunder-anointed Dragon Horn on Lord Malevolence's forehead suddenly blazed with a blinding, otherworldly light. Bolts of lightning crackled and danced around it, casting an electrifying glow. Even before it unleashed its full fury, a strange, tingling sensation washed over everyone in the vicinity, sending shivers of dread down their spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that split-second, Osborne's survival instincts kicked into high gear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could sense that the Thunder-anointed Dragon Horn was a far more formidable foe than the Frost-enshrined one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Frost-enshrined Dragon Horn was fearsome because of its unrelenting freezing effect. As long as his Sacred Power held out, he had a chance to counter it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Thunder-anointed Dragon Horn was in a league of its own. Its true strength lay in its explosive, raw power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his shield of Sacred Power failed against this new onslaught, he would be in mortal danger. Even the Chaotic Spiritual Root, which could replenish his energy, wouldn't be able to save him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It couldn't boost his defensive capabilities beyond their limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a confident grunt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of panicking, he barked a sharp command, "Eclipse War Armor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, a magnificent armor materialized around him, forged entirely from his Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his defenses firmly in place, Osborne fixed Lord Malevolence with a steely glare. "Bring it on! Let's see the full extent of your so-called power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence let out a sneering laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Thunder-anointed Dragon Horn on his forehead reached the zenith of its glow. Streams of pure lightning swirled around it, coalescing into a menacing serpent-like form that coiled and writhed menacingly above his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed an accusatory finger at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, then, steel yourself for what's coming! It's time to put an end to this farce!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the lightning serpent lunged forward with breathtaking speed, hurtling towards Osborne like a meteor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the heightened senses granted by activating Satan's Eye, Osborne found it almost impossible to track its movement. It was so swift that he scarcely had a moment to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sacred Dragon Clan is truly a force to be reckoned with! Lord Malevolence has only fused with the dragon horns, yet his attacks are simply astonishing. I can only imagine what a true member of the Sacred Dragon Clan is capable of in battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his thoughts were abruptly cut short as the lightning serpent crashed into his Eclipse War Armor with a deafening boom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An explosion of electrical energy erupted, engulfing Osborne in a vast storm of lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Eclipse War Armor, despite being forged from his powerful Sacred Power, stood no chance against such a ferocious onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It shattered almost instantaneously. The overwhelming surge of electricity washed over Osborne, causing his body to tense up, a searing pain shooting through him as if thousands of needles were stabbing into his flesh and bones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt as if his very being was fracturing under the strain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the breakdown appeared agonizingly slow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, his physical form had merged with Primordial, reaching the stage of Infinite Sacred Body, and then further enhanced by the fragment of the World Tree, placing him firmly in the mid-stage of that form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the Thunder-anointed Dragon Horn was indeed powerful enough to shred his Sacred Power armor with ease, it couldn't completely shatter Osborne's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, folds of resilient bark-like texture emerged across his skin, reminiscent of the World Tree's bark, deflecting the full brunt of the lightning attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly felt a surge of relief wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered at Lord Malevolence, saying, "Is this really all you've got? Doesn't seem so impressive! You think you could kill me this way? You'll have to try a lot harder!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence's expression darkened, shock evident on his face as he observed the bark-like patterns on Osborne's body absorbing the impact of the Thunder-anointed Dragon Horn's attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is happening here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could you possibly withstand the Thunder-anointed Dragon Horn's assault with just your flesh? That's unheard of! Even a regular Empyrean Sacredness warrior couldn't achieve such a feat!" he murmured to himself, disbelief etched into every word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anger twisted Lord Malevolence's features as he realized that neither the Frost-enshrined Dragon Horn nor the Thunder-anointed Dragon Horn had been able to defeat Osborne. The pressure was mounting, and with each passing moment, his rage deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He understood that if he didn't eliminate Osborne today, he would never get another chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of being hunted down by Osborne was unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence would never be able to rebuild the Malevolence Empire; there would be no safe haven left for him on Celestara Planet. Even if he survived, he would be forced to retreat with the Paramount Supreme Clan and the Dark Deity Legion, fleeing into the depths of space in search of a new home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a fate he simply couldn't accept!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have to kill Osborne today&mdash;at any cost!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With grim determination, Lord Malevolence clenched his jaw. "So, you've returned from the cycle of reincarnation, God of Night. Not only are you stronger, but your tricks have grown more numerous and cunning. You can even block the Thunder-anointed Dragon Horn's attack with your flesh. Impressive, truly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you won't last against what I'm about to unleash!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one below the Empyrean Sacredness level can fend off this attack! You're a goner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Lord Malevolence let loose his full might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Frost-enshrined Dragon Horn and the Thunder-anointed Dragon Horn both blazed with a blinding light. Their energies intertwined and melded, creating a spectacle that was both beautiful and terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne's Satan's Eye flared up brightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A long-buried sense of impending doom washed over him like a tidal wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shock hit him like a thunderbolt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What on earth is Lord Malevolence up to that's making me feel such an overwhelming threat? Can I really not defend against his next move?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were locked firmly on Lord Malevolence, his face set in a grim expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne witnessed the two streams of light combining, a realization dawned on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a sharp gasp. "Sacred Power? Is that what this is all about?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence couldn't contain his laughter, a wicked grin spreading across his face. "You're spot on, God of Night! This is indeed Sacred Power! Don't think you're the only one who can wield it. I can too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You probably didn't know that the powers of the Sacred Dragon Clan's horns are inherently compatible, did you? Now, I'm merging the ice of the Frost-enshrined Dragon Horn with the thunder of the Thunder-anointed Dragon Horn, and voila! Sacred Power is born!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, it's not as strong as true Sacred Power, but it's definitely more potent than yours! So get ready, because this Sacred Power strike will send you on your way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Night, my dear old friend, my cherished nemesis, farewell!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, I won't give you a chance to reincarnate. I'll shatter your soul into a million pieces and ensure you're utterly obliterated! You'll vanish from this world for good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, the energies of the Frost-enshrined Dragon Horn and the Thunder-anointed Dragon Horn fused into a terrifying wave of Sacred Power. The sheer force of it sent shockwaves through Celestara Planet, instilling fear in the hearts of everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was utterly terrifying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Sacred Power pulsed ominously, shaking the very ground beneath them, causing mountains to crumble, cities to collapse, and rivers to boil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone could feel that if this Sacred Power were to unleash its full fury, most of them would likely perish in an instant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that moment, the Sacred Power was focused solely on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!" Lord Malevolence roared.</span></p><div class="pagination">
