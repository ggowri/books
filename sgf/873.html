  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa shot a sharp glare at Barlyn. "With your current skills, you think you can handle marrying multiple wives? Can you even protect them?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Barlyn's excitement instantly deflated, leaving him looking awkward and sheepish.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, I'm done with my questions," Clarissa said, dismissing the others with a wave of her hand.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She took Osborne's hand and hurried upstairs, leading him into her room, where she locked the door.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne stood there momentarily dazed, processing the whirlwind of emotions swirling around him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa turned to him, her face lighting up with a smile. "Did you hear that, Osborne? My grandfather has six wives, my father has four, and even my aunt's husband has three wives besides her!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I grew up in this kind of environment, so I'm used to it. I really don't care if you have other women besides me. I've never wanted to monopolize you.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I've been angry these past few days," Clarissa continued, puffing out her cheeks and pretending to fume.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even her mock anger was endearing.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm upset because you didn't tell me the truth! Instead, I had to hear it from Emma when she came to me, saying she wanted to compete fairly. That's how I found out!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne stared at her, his heart sinking as he listened.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa said, biting her lip, "Osborne, in my eyes, you're the best! I know there are plenty of amazing women who would want to get close to you and compete for your attention.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I never wanted to claim you for myself. As long as you're happy, I'm fine with it. But I just wish you would tell me right away if something like this happens. Please don't keep it from me."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her eyes shimmered with unshed tears as she clung to his waist, resting her cheek against his chest.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was completely taken aback.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A wave of emotion washed over Osborne. She was devoted to him, and even the thought of him being with other women didn't make her angry.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He felt a pang of guilt.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne thought, "Why do I deserve someone like her? How have I been so lucky to find someone as wonderful as Clarissa?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa is beautiful, talented, and powerful. If she wants, she can have anyone&mdash;men who will promise her the world.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, she chose me."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Taking a deep breath, he wrapped his arms tightly around her, whispering in her ear, "I'm so sorry, Clarissa! No matter what, it's my fault. I should have been honest with you. I..."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa interrupted, placing a finger over his lips, "Osborne, I told you to stop apologizing!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's put this behind us. But you have to level with me. besides Emma, who else is there?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She locked her gaze onto his, her eyes serious and demanding the truth.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne hesitated, but looking into her earnest eyes, he decided to come clean.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There are two more.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Isa and Austin."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa's face registered shock. "What? Austin? Why didn't you tell me sooner? She's my best friend! You're with her, and you didn't think to mention it?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She's still in Skyefall! You can't just leave her hanging like this!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I have to call her!" Clarissa exclaimed, pulling out her phone in a flurry of urgency.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne stood there, utterly stunned.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He studied her face, realizing Clarissa was genuinely not angry. He couldn't help but touch his nose, feeling as though he was caught in an unbelievable dream.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Clarissa had grown up in a world where her grandfather had six wives and her father had four. In her eyes, maybe this was all perfectly normal.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps she really didn't mind at all.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, Osborne hadn't seen a hint of dissatisfaction on her face.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Clarissa was already chatting excitedly with Austin over the phone, her voice bubbling with enthusiasm. She even mentioned how the two of them could always be together.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne felt a wave of unease wash over him as he listened to her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Clarissa hung up. She didn't ask about Isa or how he ended up with the other women.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instead, she pouted, fixing her gaze on Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Clarissa, what's up?" Osborne asked, a twinge of anxiety creeping into his voice.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She snorted in response and suddenly lunged at him, pushing him back onto the bed. "Osborne, I'm really mad! You've been with Austin and Emma, but me? I... I want you, too!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her cheeks flushed a deep crimson as she spoke, "Osborne, I want to have your children!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne froze, his mind racing.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was taken aback by her boldness, but before he could gather his thoughts, Clarissa leaned in and kissed him fiercely. The kiss was passionate and fervent, her breath quickening as the moment intensified.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, you have to take me today, okay?" Clarissa murmured against his lips.</p><div class="pagination">
