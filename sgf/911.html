  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, I swear I'll kill Osborne! I'll flay him alive and leave him without a grave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon's voice was a tempest of rage as he sat up in the luxurious seaside mansion, his face twisted with a feral intensity that marred his handsome features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen furrowed his brow; concern etched in his expression. "Calm down, Marlon. You're not ready to take him on&mdash;not unless you can break through to Class S in record time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon's anger flared. "I can't take him down? What about you, Dad? If the Godfather is out of commission, there's no one left in the Augustine family who can stand against you! If you go after Osborne, he's as good as dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen's face darkened, shaking his head. "I want him dead, too, but he's got ties with Ms. Night. She's threatened me, which means I can't make a move against Osborne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon blinked, confusion washing over him. He had been unconscious for so long that he had no idea who this woman was or why she inspired such fear in his Dad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ebony bit her lip, her eyes wide. "Dad, are you talking about the 'Night' who's ranked number one on the Godson Rankings? I admit she's powerful&mdash;Osborne seems like a toy in her hands. But even if she's strong, she's still only a Class AAA. How can she make you so wary?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen's expression remained grave as he looked at his children, noting their injuries and the fury in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a burning desire for vengeance, but the threat posed by Isa held him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sighed deeply, "Her codename isn't just 'Night'; it's Night Witch. And she's not a Class AAA&mdash;she's hiding her true power. My hesitation isn't just about her strength; it's also about her background."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Her background?" Marlon and Ebony exchanged puzzled glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, does she have some sort of significant lineage? Is her background more powerful than the League of Divine Descent? Is her status even higher than yours as the Vice Leader?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What exactly is her identity?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen took a deep breath. "You're both grown up now; it's time I shared some truths with you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know about the Court of the Sun?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, Marlon and Ebony's eyes widened in shock. "Dad, are you talking about the Court of the Sun that emerged twenty years ago, inviting all the superpowers of the world and establishing the global agreements?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen nodded vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, that's the one! The Court of the Sun is shrouded in mystery but possesses terrifying power. Over the years, only two people have operated publicly on their behalf, yet no one dares to provoke them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon frowned deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So you're saying this Night Witch is associated with the Court of the Sun? Even if she is, why call her 'Ms. Night'? What gives her the right? She looks so young!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen's tone turned serious. "Because even Shadow Killer addresses her as 'Ms. Night' out of respect when he meets her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shadow Killer?!" Marlon gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew who Shadow Killer was; every top-tier fighter in the world recognized that name. Shadow Killer held the second spot on the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings, just behind Marlon's great-grandfather, Helios, who was number one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some even whispered that Shadow Killer's power rivaled that of Helios. The only reason Shadow Killer was ranked second was that they had never faced off, and Helios had claimed the top spot first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon's expression was gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mysterious force behind the global agreements, known as the Court of the Sun, had only two operatives in the field. Shadow Killer and Night Witch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shadow Killer was tasked with annihilating any superpower that dared to defy the global agreements. His reputation for brutality had left no superpower willing to cross that line&mdash;not even the formidable League of Divine Descent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, despite his immense strength, Shadow Killer treated Night Witch with utmost respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon thought, "Does that mean her status within the Court of the Sun surpasses his?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marlon felt a chill run down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen spoke up, his tone grave, "Ms. Night threatened me, saying only someone of Osborne's caliber or level could take him on. So unless Osborne breaks through to Class S, I can't touch him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The siblings fell into a heavy silence, frustration and resentment etched on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold laugh suddenly echoed from behind them, breaking the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I can help you deal with Night Witch, would you dare to take out Osborne?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
