  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Kurt called out his bid of ten thousand Celestial Crystals, Osborne finally relented, deciding not to push the price any further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt was furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the auctioneer's gavel came down, a wave of relief washed over him. He had come to this auction with a singular goal&mdash;to secure a Miracle Elixir. He had even boasted about buying all ten that were up for grabs today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Kurt walked away empty-handed, he'd never be able to show his face again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole of Apocalypse City would have a good laugh at his expense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he had succeeded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt had won a precious white Miracle Elixir, even if it cost him at least four thousand Celestial Crystals more than the usual price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least he had it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a surge of satisfaction, Kurt turned his gaze to Osborne, his expression dripping with arrogance. "What happened? Why didn't you keep bidding? You were so cocky before. Can't handle just 10 thousand Celestial Crystals? Is that all you've got? Pathetic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Kurt felt a sense of release, as if all the pent-up frustration had finally found its outlet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, he envisioned Osborne's face turning red with humiliation, his anger boiling over while Kurt continued to mock him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to Kurt's shock, Osborne remained calm, even smiling slightly, looking at him as if he were some kind of fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Congratulations, Mr. Baxter! You finally snagged a white Miracle Elixir! But I couldn't help but notice that Tristan from the Hudson family just got one for 200 thousand Ultimate Essence Crystals. And you? You spent 10 thousand Celestial Crystals, which is like a million Ultimate Essence Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, the Baxter family really knows how to throw money around!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten thousand Celestial Crystals for a single elixir? That's quite the splurge! I bought seven Miracle Elixirs for only eight thousand five hundred Celestial Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really are living large, Mr. Baxter!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mocking tone made Kurt's triumphant smile falter, replaced by a flash of anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne wasn't done. He continued, "I thought you were here to break through to a new level of power? Too bad the white Miracle Elixir doesn't actually help with that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seems like all the elixirs that can boost your level and power have already been snatched up by me. Sorry about that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each word, Kurt felt his rage boil over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was hitting him where it hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, the white Miracle Elixir was valuable, but it wasn't what he needed right now. He wasn't injured, nor did he have any loved ones who were. Buying the white elixir was just a temporary fix for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the elixirs that could actually enhance his power? He hadn't gotten a single one of those.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all gone, taken by Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt's fury reached a boiling point. He had intended to use this moment to humiliate Osborne, but now he found himself on the receiving end of the insults. His face flushed red with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you!" he growled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, an amused glint in his eye. "Mr. Baxter, you might want to tone it down with the threats. Do you really think the Supernal Deity King of the Sanctum of Light is just a decoration? Go ahead, try something. I can't be bothered to push your buttons anymore. We don't get many fools like you around here. If you get yourself killed, where will I find my entertainment?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell are you calling a fool?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt exploded, his eyes blazing with fury, his blood boiling as he felt the urge to lash out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who spends ten thousand Celestial Crystals on a white Miracle Elixir? That's just plain foolish! Seriously, is that thing even useful to you?" Osborne taunted, unflinching in the face of Kurt's fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." Kurt felt his temper rising, ready to explode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could lose control, the Supernal Deity King interjected, his voice echoing through the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Silence! We're continuing the auction. Anyone who stirs up trouble will face severe consequences!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warning washed over Kurt like a bucket of cold water, instantly cooling his heated emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bit his lip, simmering with frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine! You'll regret this!" he spat, sinking back down into his seat, barely managing to rein in his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The final item up for bid was the yellow Miracle Elixir, a substance capable of enhancing one's Divine Body. It was even rarer than the white elixir because elevating the Divine Body was notoriously difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's interest in the yellow Miracle Elixir overshadowed his previous excitement for the white one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Divine Body had already reached the pinnacle of Level Ten, the highest level in Celestara. Despite how many yellow Miracle Elixirs he consumed, he couldn't boost his own Divine Body any further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Anastasia, Zoe, and the others were still in need of substantial quantities of the yellow elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of them hovered around the mid to late levels of Level Eight. While this was above average, Osborne felt there was still room for improvement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In order to evolve into a Supernal Deity King, one needed a strong fusion of Divine Flame and Divine Body. The more powerful both were, the greater one's strength post-transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Osborne set his sights on ensuring that their Divine Bodies reached at least Level Nine, if not higher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's Divine Body was already above Level Nine, but Osborne hoped she could push through to Level Ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This way, when it came time for them to break into the rank of Supernal Deity King, they would be even more formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination in his eyes, Osborne raised his bid for the yellow Miracle Elixir.</span></p><div class="pagination">
