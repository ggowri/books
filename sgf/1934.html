  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his Level Ten Divine Body finally transforming into an Infinite Sacred Body, Osborne was elated. His overall strength had significantly increased, and he felt an exhilarating surge of power coursing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, as he contemplated the cosmos, a nagging thought crept in. There were beings known as Sacred Dragons that were born with Single Dragon Might, a power that matched his own current abilities. Just when they opened their eyes, they could surpass him in strength. The realization left Osborne feeling somewhat deflated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the Sacred Dragon was merely one of the most powerful races in existence. There were many such formidable beings scattered throughout this vast cosmos, and the thought of it was overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He muttered to himself, "I'm still not strong enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm still too weak!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now's not the time to get cocky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Primordial mentioned that some powerful members of the Human Community can actually hold their own against adult Sacred Dragons! If they can do it, then so can I!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fierce determination burned in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "All I need is time! One day, I'll leave this little corner of Celestara and witness the brilliance of the cosmos! I want to meet those truly powerful super races!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for now... I need to focus on getting stronger and find a way to deal with Lord Malevolence and his Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I don't, I won't just miss my chance to explore the cosmos. I might not even survive Lord Malevolence's wrath!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne calmed himself, refocusing his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gazed at the massive root of the World Tree and murmured, "Primordial said that once it grows stronger, it can help me integrate this root into my body! When that happens, my strength will increase even further, and I'll possess the full power of World Force!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to keep this root safe. It's a remnant of the World Tree!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, Osborne reunited with Anastasia and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you seem... different somehow," Anastasia remarked, her brow furrowed in curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group exchanged glances, sensing a change in him, even though his appearance hadn't altered at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, not hiding anything from them. He recounted the events that had transpired, his voice steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? The World Tree?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A fragment of the World Tree?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An Infinite Sacred Body?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sacred Dragon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Single Dragon Might?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces lit up with shock and awe, followed by a wave of envy directed at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had fused with an offshoot of the World Tree and gained an Infinite Sacred Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap between him and them had widened yet again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne reassured them, "Don't feel discouraged. I believe that one day, each of you can achieve an Infinite Sacred Body, too! Remember, we've got a massive stash of Miracle Elixirs&mdash;over a hundred thousand of them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Initially, I just hoped you could elevate your Divine Bodies to Level Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, when you break through to Supernal Deity King, your Divine Flame and Divine Body will merge, leading to a transformation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you reach Level Nine, you might just hit Level Ten after that metamorphosis! I used to think that was the limit... but now we know about the Infinite Sacred Body, so it's time to set our sights even higher!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before you break through to Supernal Deity King, aim to elevate your Divine Bodies to Level Ten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When you merge it with the Divine Flame, there's a good chance you'll achieve an Infinite Sacred Body! Primordial said that only beings with an Infinite Sacred Body can freely traverse the cosmos... so let's all work hard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave the Miracle Elixir business to me. Just focus on leveling up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he finished speaking, excitement flickered in everyone's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A higher goal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Level Ten Divine Body?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Awesome! We'll give it our all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, "Next up, I'll accelerate time for you all to two hundred times faster!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his power now enhanced, Osborne's time power had reached new heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could easily speed up the flow of time in the Hope Haven to that extraordinary rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once that was settled, Osborne sought out the members of the Blood Demon clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back at Primordial Divine Peak, he had taken down two Supernal Deity Kings from the Paramount Supreme Clan, along with over 10 thousand warriors from various races, collecting a massive amount of blood energy in the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he intended to use this blood energy to help the Blood Demon members elevate their ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the Blood Demon members had already reached the Deity King level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, advancing further from Deity King was no small feat. Even with their access to Celestial Crystals, their progress was painfully slow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only way to truly speed things up would be through the use of Miracle Elixirs, but with over ten thousand members, it was impossible for everyone to use them freely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, the blood energy would provide a much faster route.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a hum, Osborne channeled the blood energy into the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer volume of energy from two Supernal Deity Kings and countless Deity Kings from various races surged through them, allowing each member to advance a small level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all reached the mid-stage of the Deity King level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, it's time for me to hunt down the last divine peak! Head to Epochal Divine Peak!" he announced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Central Zone, there were only two divine peaks&mdash;Primordial Divine Peak and Epochal Divine Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had chosen to tackle Primordial Divine Peak first because it was farther from the Paramount Supreme Clan's stronghold, Supreme Sovereign City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Epochal Divine Peak, however, was right next to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even now, Osborne held a respect for the Paramount Supreme Clan. It wasn't just Lord Malevolence he feared. He knew many warriors within the clan still posed a significant threat to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, Lord Malevolence was based in Supreme Sovereign City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to the memories he gleaned from Jasper and Terry, Osborne had a rough understanding of what to expect in Supreme Sovereign City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured, "There are 46 major factions within the city, each as formidable as the Dukedom Level Powers of the Human Community! The most powerful is undoubtedly the Eldridge family. Their head is none other than Lord Malevolence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Following them are nine branches of the Eldridge family, where Caesar and Terry come from. Then there are 36 external families."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first Paramount Supreme Clan members he encountered, like Tobey and Aldrich, hailed from the Bowman family, one of the 36 external families, which ranked at the bottom of the Paramount Supreme Clan hierarchy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, the Bowman family still boasted more than one Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, the Paramount Supreme Clan was a coalition of forty-six family factions, each possessing Supernal Deity Kings, all residing in Supreme Sovereign City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This city was nestled at the foot of Epochal Divine Peak to the east.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumor had it that due to Lord Malevolence's presence in Supreme Sovereign City, even the powerful Deathborn army dared not provoke it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Epochal Divine Peak was the last divine peak on Osborne's list to explore.</span></p><div class="pagination">
