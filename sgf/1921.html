  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne approached the last section of the perimeter around the Primordial Divine Peak, he stumbled upon a peculiar scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of warriors from various clans were laboriously digging away at the earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What they were unearthing sent a jolt through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a massive tree root!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was all too familiar with these roots; they were often found entwined around colossal humanoid statues deep within the cores of divine peaks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had even faced similar roots during his chaotic encounter with space-time fluctuations, an experience he had narrowly survived thanks to the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back at Divine Peak Nine in the East Zone, he had also encountered a withered tree root. Though it was decrepit, it pulsed with overwhelming and pure energy, far exceeding that of Celestial Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Infinite Devouring Eyes had devoured that root, but even now, he was still processing its immense energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were just an ordinary piece of rotten tree root, Osborne wouldn't have been too shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the piece of rotten tree root that the warriors of the various tribes were excavating was more than ten times larger than the one he had obtained before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What truly stunned Osborne was that the rotten tree roots, buried deep underground, had actually sprouted!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A small sapling had sprouted from the root. Compared to the root, which stretched for tens of thousands of miles, the sapling looked tiny. However, in reality, the sapling stood over a thousand yards tall, with a trunk diameter of several dozen yards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had never seen a tree of such size before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, relative to the root it branched from, this sapling could indeed be considered "small." Its leaves shimmered, radiating a potent force, and the root system was robust, deeply embedded in the lifeless root from which it drew its sustenance. Encasing the entire sapling was a vibrant, iridescent barrier, each hue breathing with life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was glaringly obvious&mdash;the sapling wasn't ordinary at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, two warriors from the Paramount Supreme Clan were attacking the colorful protective shield with ferocity. Both were Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings, channeling the Divine Ascendance Technique, but the shield merely rippled in response, resisting their powerful blows effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Breaking through?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like an impossibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings&mdash;one an earth elemental and the other a fire elemental!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne squinted, a flicker of murderous intent flashing in his eyes. "This sapling grew from that massive root. Could it be... Is it the true essence of the root creature?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chilling thought struck Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew all too well how formidable these root entities could be; he had nearly lost his life to one in the deeper recesses of space! Even the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity had shown signs of fear and awe when faced with such a being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, the root creature was undoubtedly on the same level&mdash;if not a greater one&mdash;than the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Cosmic Treasure!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had existed long before the universe had formed, a relic from the time before the cosmos erupted into existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The root creature, then, had to be of equal standing&mdash;a Cosmic Treasure in its own right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne understood the true magnitude of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It gave him the power to transform humans into the Blood Clan and granted him immortality. Without it, he doubted he would have survived this long&mdash;let alone reached his current strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was a force more powerful than any Ultimate Divine Artifact&mdash;its effects were beyond compare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, right before Osborne stood a sapling that could very well be a Cosmic Treasure on the same level as the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. How could he not be intrigued?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "This sapling is still in its early stages! It's just recently sprouted!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I can get my hands on it and nurture it... could it grow to become a Cosmic Treasure as formidable as the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, or even surpass it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, through this sapling, I could gain deeper insights into the root creatures..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As these thoughts raced through his mind, Osborne's heart began to pound with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to get this sapling! There's no way I can let it fall into the hands of the Paramount Supreme Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With resolve, he decided to take action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, there were over 10 thousand warriors from various clans digging at the massive, decayed root. Each one was a formidable Deity King, and many were at the highest Deity King Level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne brushed off their presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his current strength, even the strongest Deity Kings posed no real threat. Sure, their numbers could be a slight inconvenience, but nothing he couldn't handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What truly concerned him were the two Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it were just one, I could probably take it on. But two? That could get tricky."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he felt a surge of determination. "If I can take down those two Supernal Deity Kings, this sapling will be mine! The potential reward far outweighs the risk&mdash;it's worth a shot!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
