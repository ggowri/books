  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Osborne brought Clarissa to stand before the God of Star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Clarissa learned of the God of Star's true identity as an ancient deity, she was momentarily stunned, but she quickly accepted the revelation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes widened with excitement when she found out that the God of Star could help her break through to Class AAA in just seven days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely! I'll stay here and train with the God of Star!" Clarissa declared without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was eager to reach Class AAA as soon as possible to support Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star smiled gently, "Don't worry, Osborne. I'll take good care of her. Here, unless another deity shows up, no one can harm her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, during this time, I'll help protect the Augustine family. As long as they stay within the family's territory, I can guarantee their safety."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a wave of gratitude wash over him at those words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thanking the God of Star, he left the dungeon and made his way back to Mount Celestial Reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with a sense of relief, he thought, "Seven days!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just seven days, Clarissa will break through to Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then I can harness her fate power to cleanse and empower my body, possibly even leap straight to Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that strength, I'll be able to tackle the challenges facing the Augustine family head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett, Rumen, just you wait! In seven days, I'll be ready to strike back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne swore to himself, his resolve hardening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather!" Just then, Wesson approached, accompanied by three Class S women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The one in the center, with hair completely white, was Miranda Augustine, the head of Sebastian's eight handmaidens. To her left stood a frail woman named Fiona Augustine, and to her right was another named Ashley Augustine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said politely, nodding to the four of them, "Greetings, Mr. Wesson Augustine, Ms. Miranda Augustine, Ms. Fiona Augustine, Ms. Ashley Augustine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, just call me Osborne. Calling me Godfather feels a bit strange, and honestly, it makes me uncomfortable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four exchanged glances, hesitation flickering across their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, it was Miranda who spoke up, "If that's what you prefer, Osborne, then we'll respect your wishes. To be honest, we've called the former Godfather in that way our entire lives, so it's a bit odd for us to suddenly call you Godfather, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled warmly at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he noticed that Wesson's expression was unusually serious. "Mr. Wesson Augustine, is there another problem?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson sighed heavily, saying, "Osborne, we have a situation in the coastal six provinces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Aberrants has launched a sudden attack, and even though the Draco Armed Services Branch is stationed there, they're struggling to hold the line! The headquarters in the six coastal provinces are under siege!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our rare metal mines have been retaken by the Aberrants, and the Draco Armed Services Branch has taken heavy losses! We're trapped here and can't provide any support."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Aberrants are launching their war against us this quickly? Could it be Gerardo himself is leading the charge? With so many powerful defenders from the Draco Armed Services Branch, how could they be breached so easily?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson shook his head, his brow furrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"According to the latest reports, Gerardo hasn't intervened. The rapid breach of the Draco Armed Services Branch's defenses is due to an overwhelming number of Class AAA clones, and even some Class S clones have appeared!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With the strength of the Draco Armed Services Branch, they simply can't withstand that kind of assault! They're currently in retreat, but the Aberrants has them pinned down. If we can't provide support soon, it's likely that the Draco Armed Services Branch will... be completely wiped out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Wesson finished speaking, Miranda, Fiona, and Ashley all wore grim expressions, matching the severity of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face darkened as well, his fists clenching tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "The Draco Armed Services Branch will be completely wiped out?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That is a catastrophic blow! The Draco Group's primary defense force, built with immense resources and effort by Grandpa, can't fall like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they were annihilated, it would spell disaster for the entire Draco Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have to save them!" Osborne gritted his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson replied, frustration lacing his tone, "We want to help, too, but Everett and Rumen have us cornered here. There's no way out! Even if we tried to force our way through, they'd be hot on our heels, and we wouldn't stand a chance at reaching the Draco Armed Services Branch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne responded, "Mr. Wesson Augustine, you all stay here in the Augustine Estate. I'll go rescue the Draco Armed Services Branch myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You plan to do what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shock was palpable in the voices of the four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded firmly. "I have spatial power. I can slip away from the Augustine Estate without a sound. Even if Everett and Rumen are top-tier Class S fighters, they might not even notice my departure!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, to ensure everything goes smoothly, I need you to stay here. Create a diversion to keep their attention away from me; I can't let them know I've left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right now, I'm the only one capable of saving the Draco Armed Services Branch!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
