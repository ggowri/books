  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To upgrade Satan's Eye to level six, Osborne needed to absorb the star power for seven days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already been absorbing it for five days prior to this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to his plan, his Satan's Eye would be able to break through to level six on the night after Godfather's birthday party.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, something unexpected happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While imprisoned in the Augustine family's dungeon, Osborne accidentally swallowed the light elemental essence, which allowed him to keep absorbing the star power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most peculiar thing was that, even during the day, he could still absorb star power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, for him, one day of absorption equated to two days for others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the Augustine family was busy preparing for Godfather's birthday party, Osborne's Satan's Eye had begun to transform quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sixth star gradually appeared in his Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>&#8203;At the same time, the star, which had been pale gold, slowly became brilliant, pure gold.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt that his Satan's Eye had become even more powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Satan's Eye has finally reached level six!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was thrilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the most powerful individuals could have their Satan's Eye at level six and thus were considered the top tier within the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Godfather could only attain this level of Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So far, no member of the Augustine family could upgrade Satan's Eye to level seven!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next, if I want to upgrade my Satan's Eye, Godfather won't be able to help me. I can only figure it out on my own, or it will remain at level six," Osborne murmured, feeling the changes of the sixth level Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At level one, Satan's Eye enhanced static and dynamic vision and slowed down the enemy's movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At level two, it granted X-ray vision, allowing one to see through everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At level three, it converted ocular energy into mind control to manipulate matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At level four, it devoured the elemental essence, transforming the user into the most versatile elemental metahuman and integrating the essence into Devil's Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At level five, it projected illusions and created mental attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At level six, it enabled Memory Control, a more advanced application of mental power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne's Satan's Eye was upgraded to level six, his previous abilities became even more potent. For example, his X-ray vision could now penetrate through the dungeon and reveal the situation outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This surprised him extremely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He discovered that the dungeon was situated directly beneath the largest arena, Arena Number One, on Challenge Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the middle was a 66-foot-thick rock layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arena Number One stretched over a mile in both length and width. Osborne observed that it had been transformed into a birthday party venue, with countless members of the Augustine family bustling about inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a few hours, Godfather would appear here to celebrate his 80th birthday with the members of the main and branch bloodlines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one knew why he selected this venue for his birthday party other than it being his own request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was because Arena Number One was so vast, with space for thousands, that the event would occupy only a small portion of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gazed at the decorated birthday party venue and couldn't help but raise his eyebrows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pondered, "Godfather's birthday party is about to begin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I have been in Newport City for several days, but he has not come to meet me yet. I hoped to meet him directly at his birthday party, but now that I am locked up in the dungeon, it seems I will miss this birthday party."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fortunately, my Satan's Eye has advanced. Its enhanced vision is so powerful that it allows me to see the birthday party, even from this dungeon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps no one would ever suspect that I'm watching them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe I'll be able to see Godfather later!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What is he like?" Osborne thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he noticed some familiar faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac, Nathan, and some members of the Augustine family's branch bloodline from Dampston arrived early at the birthday party and sat down in a corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them wore a solemn expression, remaining silent and waiting quietly without speaking to those around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew that they were worried about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, despite being able to see everyone, he had no way to communicate with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He contemplated for a moment and simply continued practicing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After his Satan's Eye reached level six, he could still absorb the star power to boost his strength, and the rate of absorption increased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt that if he continued on this path, perhaps it wouldn't be long before he achieved Class AA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, he would no longer be at a disadvantage compared to Lance, Owen, or even Matthew. With his means and many trump cards, he believed that he would be able to defeat them at that time easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "After breaking through to Class AA, I can combine the dark and light elemental essences into Devil's Light and elevate it to level eight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How powerful will it be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I should be able to fight even against masters at Class AAA, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's almost there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He started seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, several hours passed. At that moment, the birthday party venue above Osborne on Arena Number One had become incredibly lively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost all the people from the main bloodline and the nine branch bloodlines of the Augustine family were present. They took their seats, waiting for Godfather, the protagonist of the birthday party.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was extremely excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne came to a halt and glanced at the birthday party venue again.</span></p><div class="pagination">
