  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joanna and Letitia exclaimed in unison, their voices trembling in disbelief as they stared at Osborne. Their faces were filled with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't believe their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the moment when all hope seemed lost, when they could only stand helplessly and watch as the colossal Mud Golem's massive fist hurtled toward them, a tall, imposing figure suddenly appeared out of nowhere, blocking the Mud Golem's path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, in a display of sheer dominance, this mysterious figure unleashed a powerful punch that sent the formidable Mud Golem flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Joanna and Letitia felt an overwhelming surge of joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been saved!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone&mdash;like a god&mdash;had descended upon them, driving the Mud Golem back and saving their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when Osborne turned to face them, revealing his features, their shock reached a whole new level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could hardly believe </span><span>the scene</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all knew Osborne as the Ascension One Supernal Deity King. How the hell could someone with such a low cultivation level survive in Umbra Earth's death zone, especially the notorious Corrosive Marsh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he possibly save them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But holy shit - one punch was all it took for him to demolish that Mud Golem's arm and shoulder! Even if they'd fought together, they wouldn't have scratched that monster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, Osborne's strength was beyond even what Ascension Six Chuck could achieve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No way this was the same Osborne they knew. Just no way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joanna and Letitia stared with wide eyes, their minds struggling to reconcile the Osborne they once knew with the towering, formidable figure who had just saved their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's me. Glad you're okay," Osborne said simply, his voice calm and composed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief nod, he turned to survey their surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, over twenty massive Mud Golems continued their rampage. Their terrifying fists could crush even an Ascension Five cultivator with a single hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two of the Mud Golems now approached Chuck, their crystalline eyes glowing with a faint golden light as they locked onto him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deafening roar, they charged, their fists raised high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground trembled beneath their assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chuck, barely managing to lift his head, felt the weight of despair settle in. He had no strength left to resist, no choice but to watch helplessly as the Mud Golem's fist came crashing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joanna's face turned white as she witnessed Chuck's plight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She </span><span>quickly</span><span> plead</span><span>ed</span><span> with Osborne. "Osborne, save my brother!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded without hesitation. In the blink of an eye, he moved to Chuck's side, his body flickering as he utilized interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two Mud Golems' fists were mere inches from their target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Osborne had more time to prepare. He didn't rely on brute physical strength alone, for even though his body had been refined into an Infinite Sacred Body, his cultivation level was still too low to fully harness its power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he could destroy the Mud Golems, he couldn't inflict severe damage on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he decided to use his Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his fist glowed with Sacred Power, he struck with overwhelming force. The two Mud Golems were engulfed in the surge of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thunderous boom, their fists hadn't even hit the ground before their entire bodies disintegrated into a torrent of mud, scattering everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only two blue, peculiar crystals the size of fists and four pale golden crystals remained, clutched tightly in Osborne's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blue crystals had been embedded in the Mud Golems' chests, seemingly their source of power. Osborne could feel a strange, pulsating energy emanating from them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suspected these blue crystals might be some kind of treasure from the Umbra Earth and decided to keep them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the four pale golden crystals, those were the Mud Golems' eyes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Osborne grasped the pale golden crystals, his Satan's Eye stirred faintly, as if excited or eager.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression shifted, his curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Satan's Eye seems interested in these pale golden crystals. Could they be the key to enhancing my ability?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the thought of this, Osborne suddenly felt a surge of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Satan's Eye had already reached level ten, its peak, and hadn't advanced in a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To reach the Sacredness Level, it would need to undergo a transformation, but Osborne had yet to discover how.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with these golden crystals, a glimmer of hope emerged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, "Satan's Eye rarely reacts to anything. If it's responding now, these crystals must have some effect on it.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Then I'll need to collect more of them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's gaze locked onto the remaining Mud Golems, his eyes gleaming with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbeknownst to him, Chuck, still sitting on the ground, stared at him in utter disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had destroyed a Mud Golem with a single punch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chuck knew better than anyone how formidable the Mud Golems were. As an Ascension Six Supernal Deity King, he had battled them for so long without being able to destroy even one, only managing to repel them time and again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here was Osborne, with a mere punch, annihilating a Mud Golem as if it were nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the heck!" Chuck muttered under his breath, his breath catching in his throat. He didn't know Osborne, but gratitude swelled in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless of how or why, Osborne had saved his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to speak when Osborne turned his attention to the remaining Mud Golems, moving swiftly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll take them down! All of them!" Osborne said, his voice cold and resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he drew the Bloodwrought Bow. As he channeled his Sacred Power into the weapon, three gray arrows materialized on the bowstring&mdash;Sacred Power arrows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrows shot out with blistering speed, each carrying the properties of both spatial and dark arrows&mdash;unpredictable, devastating, corrosive, and impossible to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a heartbeat, the three arrows struck their targets, hitting three Mud Golems with unerring accuracy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impacted Mud Golems exploded instantly, their bodies disintegrating under the overwhelming might of the Sacred Power arrows. All that remained were three blue crystals and six pale golden crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Sacred Power swept through the remnants, gathering the crystals and storing them in his Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't stop there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arrow after arrow rained down, each Sacred Power arrow annihilating a Mud Golem with ease. For every Golem felled, Osborne gained one blue crystal and two pale golden crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the span of a dozen breaths, the battlefield fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over twenty Mud Golems lay destroyed, their remains scattered across the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Osborne's Sacred Power arrows, these once-terrifying creatures had been reduced to nothing more than clumsy targets, unable to even flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Dimensional Space now held twenty-eight blue crystals and fifty-six pale golden crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his hand, he stowed the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to face the others, he found them staring at him in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was speechless, their eyes wide with disbelief.</span></p><div class="pagination">
