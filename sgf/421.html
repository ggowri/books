  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris' and Bruce's faces both turned ugly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared at the huge harpoon in Bryce's hand with fear and greed in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In ancient mythology, Poseidon, the God of the Sea, could use his trident to create huge waves, cause storms and tsunamis, and even trigger major earthquakes. He possessed powerful and terrifying power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Above the sea, Poseidon's trident was considered the most powerful weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The harpoon that Bryce was holding was most likely the legendary trident of Poseidon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one knew whether it was true or false.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was certain that Bryce's harpoon was a powerful divine artifact, and it possessed terrifying power at sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because of this harpoon that Bryce could become the absolute overlord of this sea area. Even the King of the Aberrants and Godfather were unwilling to fight with him at sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't you get out of here? Are you waiting for me to kill you?" Bryce said coldly to Chris and Bruce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two looked at each other, with frustration and unwillingness in their eyes, but they could only retreat in the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew that they couldn't kill Osborne with Bryce here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't even dare to say anything harsh to Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could only say to Serena and Osborne, "Just wait. Today is just the beginning. The great King of the Aberrants will soon return to Rosmandi. By then, everything that belongs to Godfather will collapse. The king will chop off the Godfather's head with his own hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When the time comes, you will all die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone who dares to be an enemy of the king and stand on the side of Godfather will die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, the two of them turned around and ran away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena hesitated for a moment, but she didn't make another move. Her condition was not very good, and it was impossible for her to keep Chris and Bruce by herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Bryce with a respectful expression, she said gratefully, "Supreme Overlord Bryce, thank you for saving me today. If it weren't for you, I'm afraid I would have died."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce was shocked when he heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hernandez, I'm flattered. I am not yet a Supreme Overlord. I can just use the trident to barely unleash some Supreme Overlord-level strength. I am still far from being a real Supreme Overlord like the King of Aberrants and Godfather."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena shook her head. "In any case, if you can unleash the power of the Supreme Overlord, you should be called the Supreme Overlord. This is what Godfather told me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Bryce grinned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did Godfather really say that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena nodded and said seriously, "Godfather said that you are the one closest to the Supreme Overlord among the younger generation. With the trident, you can even fight with the real Supreme Overlord on the sea. You should also be called the Supreme Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce looked respectful and wanted to know what Godfather thought of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather also said that if you want to become a Supreme Overlord, you must give up the trident in your hand. You rely too much on it. The power of the trident has become an obstacle to you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only by giving it up can you get the real power and breakthrough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Serena finished speaking, Bryce was stunned. His face showed a look of struggle and hesitation, and he raised the trident in his hand with reluctance in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, he took a long breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "There is another person... No, there is another god who also told me to give up the trident, saying that it would be an obstacle to my growth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But how can I give it up now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I give it up, who will protect my relatives and friends? If I give it up, who will support the eight thousand subordinates in Likreia Mountain?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I haven't made up my mind yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But no matter what, I should thank Godfather for his advice. I will think about it carefully, and when I feel I can let it go, I will let it go without hesitation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena smiled and said, "No matter what, you are already the closest to the Supreme Overlord. No matter how hard I try in this life, I will never be able to get close to that level."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce smiled and said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone had different talents. Working hard didn't mean one would get something. An ordinary person's hard work might just mean a piece of cake for a genius.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Bryce didn't know how to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Osborne and said, "Brat, my mission is complete. I should go. But before I leave, you have to tell me where Kendra is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't understand anything about the conversation between Serena and Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Supreme Overlord?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From what they said, was this a level?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was this a level that only the King of Aberrants and Godfather could reach?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had never heard of it before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Bryce's words, he finally came back to his senses and said, "Is your sister Kendra, the girl whose power is to sense energy? As long as she senses the energy, she will never forget it so that she can track it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce raised his eyebrows with a look of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's what she told you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kendra is naughty. It's all my fault. I have been locking her up in the Likreia Mountain and not allowing her to come out. That's why her personality has become so weird."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned. "What do you mean?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
