  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne ultimately decided to exchange for Sacred Turtle Mountain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This Sacred Turtle Mountain can be regarded as both an offensive Sacred Artifact and a defensive Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its attack method is throwing it to smash the enemy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sacred Turtle Mountain itself is incredibly heavy. Once activated, it can be thrown. The massive mountain falling down would cause even warriors at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection or Great Perfection to panic and flee.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, if hit, ordinary Defensive Sacred Artifacts won't be able to withstand it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sacred Turtle Mountain can easily shatter a small planet into pieces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In addition, he can not only use Sacred Turtle Mountain to smash people but also infuse it with power. The stronger the infused power, the heavier Sacred Turtle Mountain becomes, and the faster it smashes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, this method is straightforward and brutal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those hit either block it if they can, or if not, they'll be smashed into pulp, leaving hardly any remains.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only that, Sacred Turtle Mountain is extremely massive and sturdy, serving as a natural barrier when placed in front. It's incredibly difficult for ordinary people to break through, let alone shatter it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This simple and brutal method of attack and defense is astonishing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although the price is as high as 30 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, Osborne has no better choice. He finally decides to keep this Sacred Turtle Mountain. When facing an unbeatable expert, he can simply throw it to crush the opponent to death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "The only drawback of Sacred Turtle Mountain might be its excessive consumption of Sacred Power. Activating it requires a huge amount of Sacred Power, and if I want to control its direction afterward, it will drain a large amount of Sacred Power every second."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ordinary people indeed find it hard to control, as even slight use would deplete their Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps this is precisely why the Sacred Turtle Mountain, despite its immense power, has remained in the Royal Treasury and was never taken by any Royal Family member."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly and put away the Sacred Turtle Mountain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For him, the drawback of Sacred Turtle Mountain consuming Sacred Power is completely negligible. After all, his Sacred Power will never run out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For him, as long as he can activate the Sacred Turtle Mountain, nothing else matters.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "The Sacred Turtle Mountain will become another of my ultimate moves!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he continued searching for his target.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After redeeming the Sacred Turtle Mountain, Osborne's Kingdom Duel Scorepoints were almost depleted, leaving only nine billion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nine billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints can be exchanged for a slightly better Supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne already had a clear goal. "Dragon Binding Rope exchange price: nine billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne approached a rope. It looked ordinary but emitted an extremely powerful Sacred Artifact aura, being a rather formidable Supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its function is also very simple.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyone bound by it will have their strength suppressed, making it hard to break free.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This ability is similar to Clara's Dominating Coil.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had long wanted Clara's Dominating Coil. However, her family-inherited battle skill was something he couldn't learn. Although he had many ways to kill opponents, capturing them alive wasn't easy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, the Dragon Binding Rope perfectly makes up for this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The only problem is that after using the Dragon Binding Rope to bind an enemy, one must continuously inject power to prevent them from breaking free. For those without deep or strong Sacred Power, merely restraining the enemy for a short time could deplete their own Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne has no concerns about depleting Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, in his hands, the Dragon Binding Rope can unleash its greatest power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He exchanged nine billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints for the Dragon Binding Rope.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne put away the Dragon Binding Rope and immediately breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, all his Kingdom Duel Scorepoints were completely spent, leaving none remaining. He used these points to exchange for Michelle's two relics, the ring and token, as well as three Supreme Sacred Artifacts: Domain Suppression Stele, Sacred Turtle Mountain, and Dragon Binding Rope.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This harvest can be considered quite substantial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt very satisfied at this moment. His only regret was not yet finding Michelle's other relic, the necklace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Next, I must carefully observe the Royal Family members to find out who has my mother's necklace relic. No matter which member has it, I must find a way to take it back."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They are not worthy of possessing my mother's relics!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A trace of determination flashed in Osborne's eyes. He glanced around. The two-hour time limit was about to end, with less than ten minutes remaining.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Clara and Leroy. "Have Clara and Leroy completed the exchange?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They still seemed to be undecided, discussing something while standing in front of a Sacred Artifact, but eventually decided to take it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, there wasn't much time left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the two of them also looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara asked, "Osborne, have you made your choice?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "All set! I've used up all my Kingdom Duel Scorepoints."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We are too," Clara said with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each of them had 24 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints and selected two Supreme Sacred Artifacts, one for attack and one for defense, greatly enhancing their strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if they break through to Empyrean Sacredness in the future, they will no longer lack Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Keep in mind, many Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warriors don't have a Supreme Sacred Artifact, yet they, not even at Empyrean Sacredness, already possess two.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All of this was brought to them by Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without Osborne's help, they likely wouldn't have stood out in Zephyr State's state duel, let alone participate in the zone duel or the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without Osborne's help, they couldn't have tied with Osborne for the championship in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel and gained so many Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, their fate was completely changed because of Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, "Let's go, let's head out first!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although powerful Sacred Artifacts can quickly enhance our strength, the most important thing is to improve our own abilities! Moreover, mastering a powerful Sacred Artifact is no easy task. If mishandled, it could backfire and cause problems."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two nodded seriously, the joy on their faces gradually fading, especially Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy had been backfired by the Inferno Drake Lance before. She was well aware of the dangers of being backfired by a Sacred Artifact. Even though her strength was greater now, mastering a Supreme Sacred Artifact was still no easy task, and the slightest mistake could lead to a backlash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, they still had the Legendary Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Legendary Dragon Elixir would help them quickly master the Supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Osborne and the other two left the Royal Treasury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other contestants also walked out one after another, their faces full of excitement. The numerous Sacred Artifacts in the Royal Treasury had broadened their horizons, and they had exchanged for Sacred Artifacts suitable for them, enhancing their strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aiden said, "Alright, everyone, head back!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Please don't leave Nebula City these two days. In two days, the guards will take you to the Palace again and lead you to a place of opportunity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Please refrain from breaking through your cultivation level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Otherwise, you won't be able to go to the place of opportunity."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Aiden finished speaking, he led everyone out of the Palace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three of Osborne returned to the hotel and immediately began cultivating. Even Osborne used the hundredfold Time Acceleration, fully dedicating himself to cultivation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two days later, they will head to Necropolis City!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During these two days, he must master the three newly acquired Supreme Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once he masters these three Supreme Sacred Artifacts, his strength will increase, allowing him to survive better in Necropolis City and disrupt Frederick's plans.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, he also needs to study Michelle's relics.</span></p><div class="pagination">
