  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air crackled with menacing energy, a palpable wave of murderous intent and terrifying pressure rolling in like a storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the expressions of everyone in the vicinity hardened dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett went pale; every muscle tensed as he fixed his gaze on the direction of Challenge Peak, his face etched with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Rumen, who had been locked in a fierce aerial battle, suddenly changed his demeanor, abandoning his assault on Wesson and retreating to a safe distance, his eyes darting toward Challenge Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen barked, his voice a mix of bravado and uncertainty, "Who's there? You think you can scare us off like this? Dream on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Rumen charged toward Challenge Peak, but in the blink of an eye, a blinding white light flashed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen was sent flying backward, blood spewing from his mouth as a gaping wound opened in his chest, leaving him ghostly pale and filled with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cold, ancient voice echoed again, sending chills down everyone's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't force my hand. If you don't leave the Augustine Estate now, you'll all be staying here permanently."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A heavy silence fell over the crowd, thick with dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was a mask of astonishment; he recognized that voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hidden powerhouse from the Augustine Estate's dungeon had intervened at a critical moment, not only saving him but also injuring the formidable Rumen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hope flickered in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Rumen, Everett, and the others were gripped by fear. The strength needed to injure Rumen with a single blow was unfathomable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged glances filled with resentment, their minds racing. If only they had a little more time, they could eliminate Osborne and the other core members of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you still not leaving?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star's voice cut through the tension, an oppressive aura making Marlon and Scarlett tremble with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes turned to Rumen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen gritted his teeth. "Who the hell are you? What's your connection to the Augustine family? Why are you helping them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star replied coldly, "You don't need to know who I am, and I have no ties to the Augustine family. But this is my sanctuary, and your brawl is disturbing my peace. I can't stand noisy pests, so I suggest you get out now, or I'll wipe you all out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen's anger flared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "So, this mysterious figure has no stake in our conflict but still insists on meddling?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, so this is your hidden domain? My apologies for the disturbance, but I'm here to eradicate the Augustine family! My grandfather is Helios, so I expect you to show some respect. Once I'm done wiping out the Augustine family, we'll leave without another word."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, pride shone in Rumen's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His grandfather, Helios, was the strongest in Blue Planet, and he couldn't believe that someone lurking in the shadows would dare to disregard Helios' name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star murmured, his tone icy, "Helios? Never heard of him. And frankly, I have no interest in granting him any favors. You need to leave, and you need to do it now, or I'll take action."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of dread washed over Rumen as he processed the gravity of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "This mysterious figure isn't intimidated by my grandfather's reputation? Who's him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suppressing his fury, Rumen reluctantly replied, "Fine, fine! If you won't show any respect, we'll leave at once!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Wesson, a menacing glint in his eyes. "Wesson, consider yourselves lucky this time! But don't think your luck will hold out forever. The moment you step out of the Augustine Estate, your time will be up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're all marked for extinction!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen wasted no time hesitating; he quickly gathered Marlon, Scarlett, and the others, and in the blink of an eye, they disappeared from the Augustine family's territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they left, a wave of relief washed over the remaining members of the Augustine family, who promptly collapsed onto the ground, exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of them had suffered significant injuries, but none more so than Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had a massive gaping wound in his chest, and virtually every bone in his body felt shattered. If it weren't for his remarkable vitality, he would have been dead long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Rumen and the others gone, Osborne could no longer hold on; he fainted almost instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he finally regained consciousness, a day had already passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blinking against the light, he recognized two familiar faces hovering anxiously over him. As soon as they noticed he was awake, their faces lit up with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa? You're here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Emma, are you okay?" Osborne gasped in surprise as he sat up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma glanced at Clarissa before replying, "Clarissa helped me heal. I'm all good now! How about you, how are you feeling?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne ran a hand over his body, shocked to find that all his wounds had healed. Part of it was due to his potent healing abilities, and another part was thanks to Clarissa's divine healing powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine," Osborne said, but his expression quickly darkened as thoughts of Caleb, who had sacrificed to save him, flooded his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the situation with the Augustine family now?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
