  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne transformed into a Vampire, driven by an insatiable hunger to absorb the blood energy swirling around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere was thick with it. Twenty Class AAA Evolved Humans, the formidable Luca, and several Class AA Palmers lay dead nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their combined energy and blood formed an immense reservoir, and Osborne eagerly siphoned it all, feeling the Blood Cross swell with power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each drop he absorbed, the Blood Cross became more agile, awakening even greater strength within him. His blood-red hair seemed to glisten as if it were about to drip with fresh blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, however, the Blood Cross could no longer contain the overwhelming influx of energy and blood. The excess power spilled over, enhancing Osborne's physical prowess, but it still wasn't enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determined not to waste a single drop, Osborne concentrated the surplus energy into blood energy. He planned to save it for his fellow Blood Demons, allowing them to rapidly increase their strength when he returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a solid half hour, Osborne tirelessly absorbed every last bit of blood energy from the surroundings, gathering over five thousand drops of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "Five thousand drops of blood energy! That's enough for every Blood Demon member to get ten drops each! They could each jump a whole tier in strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time this is done, every single one of them could reach Class A+, and many might even break through to Class AA!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a surge of happiness at the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was just the energy that had leaked out; the Blood Cross had absorbed even more. He sensed that in his Vampire form, his power could double.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body felt stronger, pushing him closer to the Class AAA threshold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Phew!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stored the blood energy in his Dimensional Space before turning his attention to Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa had recovered and was now tending to Donna and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's gaze shifted to Emma, who was still unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her injuries had healed, thanks to Clarissa's divine healing, but she hadn't yet woken up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dense aura of power was swirling around her, intensifying by the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa noticed the change as well. "Osborne, what's going on with her? I've healed her wounds, but she still hasn't woken up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head. "She's fine. The reason she hasn't come to is that she's... breaking through to Class AAA! She was severely injured in this battle, nearly exhausting all her strength and coming close to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But because of that, she's found an opportunity to make a breakthrough. When she wakes up, she'll be a Class AAA powerhouse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, a twinge of envy crept into his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Class AAA!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had that level of power, taking down the Palmers and Luca would have been a walk in the park&mdash;no danger, no serious injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma was just a few months younger than him, yet she was on the verge of breaking through first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her already formidable strength and the swallow shield, once she hit Class AAA, facing her would be no small feat for Osborne. Still, this was a good thing for the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's wait for her to wake up," Osborne said finally, glancing at Donna and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what's up with them? Why aren't they awake yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa bit her lip, worry etched on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I didn't want to wake them. With the Radcliffe family wiped out, I'm afraid they won't handle it well. Besides, we had a falling out earlier. I'm worried they'll be upset to see me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart ached at the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew how deeply Clarissa cared for the Radcliffe family. She had severed ties with Dylan and Eugen, even breaking off relations with them, all for his sake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne understood that this had caused her immense pain, even if she had not shown it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled Clarissa into a comforting embrace and said gently, "Wake them up. What's done is done; they need to face it. Besides, they are your family. No matter how they feel about you, I'll face it with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa nodded firmly at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of her hand, a surge of energy flowed into the bodies of the four individuals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment later, the four groaned softly and began to wake up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they took in their surroundings, they stared in stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa? Osborne? How are you here? Weren't we captured by those black-clad men?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Radcliffe family is gone! Everyone from the Radcliffe family was killed. It's our fault for not being strong enough to protect them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Radcliffe family is gone!" Donna repeated, her eyes brimming with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other three were also in tears, having witnessed the Aberrants' massacre of their family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their grief was palpable, and the pain was unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's eyes were red, her tears on the verge of spilling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Grandpa, Dad, Aunt Donna!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. As long as we're here, the Radcliffe family isn't truly gone. We'll work together to rebuild it!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
