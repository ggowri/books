  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Class SS!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no question that Clarissa had also scored a Class SS in the Astral Testing Arch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela, Amber, and the others were already immune to the shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They themselves had only managed to achieve a Class S in the test. Back then, their teachers had pulled out all the stops to track them down, scouring the Racial Convergence Planet and putting in innumerable hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd once been so chuffed about their Class S talents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, out of the blue, a whole bunch of Class SS super prodigies had popped up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was beyond unfair!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, reality was staring at them in the face. No matter how preposterous it seemed, the results were set in stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma, Austin</span><span>,</span><span> and Anita took their turns in the Astral Testing Arch, and every single one of them came out with a Class SS score.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this time, even Angela was getting antsy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She egged on Anastasia, Zoe</span><span>,</span><span> and Mila to give the Astral Testing Arch a go, hoping for a different twist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But lo and behold, the result was still Class SS!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, among all those present, only Isa and Osborne hadn't stepped into the Astral Testing Arch yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They just stood there, showing no sign of wanting to take the test.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela and Amber shot each other a confused look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew full well that Osborne was the one in charge, while Isa boasted the highest cultivation level among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If everyone else had scored Class SS, it was reasonable to assume that Isa and Osborne's talents and potential would be equally impressive, if not better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, they seemed uninterested in testing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela and her fellow practitioners quickly began to communicate through their thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gwen exclaimed, her excitement palpable, "This is ridiculous! It's just too absurd!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those ten or so people are unbelievable! Everyone who's been tested so far has scored Class SS! I've never seen anything like it! They're not even from the Sacred Dragon Clan or Sacred Tiger Clan&mdash;how can they all be Class SS?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela said in agreement, "It really is outrageous! I can't wrap my head around it! Do you think there's something wrong with the Astral Testing Arch?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keeley interjected, "Not a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Angela, before you reached out to me, I was actually overseeing a recruitment event! The Astral Testing Arch has been in use, and most of the disciples tested were Class C or Class B. Even Class A scores were rare!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can assure you, there's nothing wrong with the Astral Testing Arch! The issue lies with these kids... they're simply favored by the heavens!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amber piped up then. "The Astral Testing Arch is in perfect working order! I've got a hunch that might just explain what's going on here..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's eyes zeroed in on her. Angela, Keeley, and Gwen were practically on the edge of their </span><span>seats</span><span>, dying to hear more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amber, spill the beans. What's your hunch?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amber stole a glance at Isa and Osborne, her face </span><span>dead serious</span><span>. "I've got a sneaking suspicion that one of them is a Celestial Progeny."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Celestial Progeny?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela, Keeley, and Gwen let out gasps of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Above the Class SS is the Class SSS, and the prodigies who made it to the Class SSS were known as Celestial </span><span>Progenies</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Celestial Progeny was more than just a title; they were the favored children of the cosmos, gifted with extraordinary potential and destiny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These rare individuals were predestined to become some of the most powerful beings in existence&mdash;provided they didn't falter along the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With seemingly minimal effort, they could rapidly ascend through the ranks of cultivation. A mere thought could enable them to grasp formidable combat techniques, harnessing abilities that others could only dream of. They stood shoulder to shoulder with the elite talents from Apex Clans, such as the illustrious Sacred Dragon Clan and the mighty Sacred Tiger Clan, possessing a prowess that set them apart in any arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the entire history of the Racial Convergence Planet, only a handful of these Celestial Progenies had ever emerged, each one a beacon of hope and aspiration for countless others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them eventually made a huge splash on the Racial Convergence Planet, becoming a living legend. In the end, they'd exhausted all the challenges on the planet and had no option but to set off for the heart of the cosmos in search of higher levels of cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celestial Progenies were as rare as hen's teeth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last time one showed up on the Racial Convergence Planet was thousands of years ago. That Celestial Progeny had outshone every powerful figure on the planet in just a thousand years and then decided to head into the cosmic center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Amber was saying there was one right here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela, Keeley, and Gwen were more than a bit skeptical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amber frowned and said, "You don't buy it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How else can you explain a whole bunch of </span><span>Class-SS super-geniuses</span><span> all grouped together? Celestial Progenies are the darlings of the universe; they just naturally attract other super geniuses to them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the good fortune of a Celestial Progeny rubs off on those around them, making their companions stronger, more talented, and brimming with greater potential!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I'm betting that one of them is definitely a Celestial Progeny! It's this Celestial Progeny who's influenced them all, leading to their Class SS scores!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Amber finished, the others stared wide-eyed, mouths agape, utterly astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What she said made so much sense!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the only explanation for why so many Class SS super-geniuses had gathered in one place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their breaths quickened as they turned to Isa and Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were the only two who hadn't yet tested their talents and potential on the Astral Testing Arch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If there truly was a Class SSS Celestial Progeny among them, it had to be one of those two!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes flicked over Isa and Osborne's faces, brimming with excitement and anticipation, as if they were eyeing precious treasures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Osborne and Isa feel a bit on edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had no clue what Amber and the others had been chatting about, but the way the four were looking at them&mdash;like </span><span>they</span><span> were about to gobble them up&mdash;almost made them want to make a run for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on, seniors?" Osborne managed to ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four of them exchanged looks, and finally, Angela took the lead, trying to rein in her excitement. "You two should step into the Astral Testing Arch for a check!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at them with eager expectation, but they didn't budge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think I'll sit this one out," Osborne said, shaking his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew his situation like the back of his hand; with his talent, stepping into the Astral Testing Arch would probably land him a Class SSS score.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Class SSS was the label for Celestial Progenies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the whole cosmos, Celestial Progenies were as rare as rocking-horse droppings. Osborne didn't want to join the Fairy Moon Sect, didn't want to become a disciple of Angela and her fellow practitioners, and definitely didn't want to draw too much attention to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes, showing off his talents and potential was just like flashing his cash&mdash;it could stir up all kinds of trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne was dead-set on avoiding the Astral Testing Arch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa chimed in, shaking her head, "I don't </span><span>wanna</span><span> take the test either. And I sure as heck don't want to be anyone's disciple."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she grabbed Osborne's hand. "Osborne, I've given it some thought, and I've decided to stick by your side! Someone's </span><span>gotta</span><span> look out for you! No matter how perilous the road ahead is, I'm not scared! I'll do whatever it takes to keep up with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she finished speaking, Osborne fell quiet, mulling over her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their refusal, though, really threw Angela and her fellow practitioners into a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were certain that either Isa or Osborne had to be the Celestial Progeny, but with both of them saying no to the test, how could they not be on pins and needles?</span></p><div class="pagination">
