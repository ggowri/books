  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body went rigid, and he instinctively furrowed his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How on earth should he handle the Dark Deity Legion? What about the Paramount Supreme Clan? And what was to be done with all those factions under Lord Malevolence's command?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no ready answers, and truth be told, he didn't feel like dealing with these matters at that very moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the majority of them didn't have the means to flee Celestara Planet. So, he wasn't in a hurry to decide their fates. Moreover, they seemed to have lost their</span><span> ability to</span><span> fight. Despair was clearly written all over their faces. With Lord Malevolence dead, they knew they had been defeated. Any further resistance would only hasten their end, and before long, many of them were laying down their arms and surrendering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, what really worried Osborne were the allies that Lord Malevolence had summoned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They came from Racial Convergence Planet, specifically a powerful sect called the Mystic Sirius Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Lord Malevolence was being overpowered by Osborne, they sensed the changing situation and made a hasty escape. At that time, Isa, Clarissa, and the others were so preoccupied with Osborne that they didn't even notice these foes slipping away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that the battle had ended and their disappearance had been noticed, it suddenly hit him how dire the situation was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, we can't let them get away!" Isa pleaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then cast a glance at the battered Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Lord Malevolence had realized that his Ascending Sacred Sanctum was a Sacred Artifact palace, then Maddox and the others would have too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they managed to flee Celestara Planet and make it back to Racial Convergence Planet, there was no doubt they'd report the matter to the top-brass of the Mystic Sirius Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, powerful members of the sect might descend upon Celestara Planet, with the sole intention of seizing his Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that would spell big trouble for him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The experts sent by the Mystic Sirius Sect were likely to be even more formidable than Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There could even be Empyrean Sacredness warriors among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a serious expression, Osborne declared, "I'll go after them! As for the Dark Deity Legion, the Paramount Supreme Clan, and the various factions, you all can figure that out. I have one condition</span><span>...</span><span> anyone who has harmed the citizens of the Human Community must be executed! Those who enslaved them will be punished as slaves! As for the rest, I trust you all to handle it well!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he waved his hand, and the Ascending Sacred Sanctum floated to his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I'm coming with you!" Isa insisted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, we're going too!" Clarissa and the others chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated. It had been a long time since he had been separated from the women, and he wanted nothing more than to have them by his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he knew it wasn't the right time. They needed to stay on Celestara Planet, where their presence could deter the Dark Deity Legion and the Paramount Supreme Clan. If anyone dared to resist, their strength was essential for keeping the peace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head. "Celestara Planet is still chaotic and needs your leadership! If you come with me, the situation here could spiral out of control!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I'll be fine. I'll be back before you know it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really doubt my strength?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words hung in the air, and the women fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't afford to waste any more time. Maddox and the other Mystic Sirius Sect members had already been gone for a while, and if he delayed, even with the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, he might not catch up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just wait here for me. I'll be back soon! Kendra, you're coming with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a hundred shimmering figures suddenly appeared behind Osborne, quickly solidifying into reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were Osborne's Spatial Clones!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forged with Sacred Power, these clones were even mightier, their attack power on par with that of the Ascension Six Supernal Deity Kings. With a hundred Spatial Clones standing behind Isa and the others, they could keep everything firmly in check.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Dark Deity Legion dared to put up a fight, Osborne's clones would unleash a ruthless onslaught, showing them no mercy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! I'm leaving!" he declared, striding into the Ascending Sacred Sanctum with Kendra beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kendra, which way did Maddox and the others go?" Osborne asked in a hurry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra had a special gift. Once she'd laid eyes on someone, she could imprint their energy signature in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This unique ability enabled her to zero-in on their location and the direction they were heading, no matter the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since she'd crossed paths with Maddox and his gang before, she knew their energy signatures like the back of her hand and could easily track them down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Osborne's secret weapon for catching up with Maddox.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra closed her eyes briefly and then pointed skyward. "They took to the sky!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Up into the sky? Are Maddox and the others planning to cross the cosmos to reach Racial Convergence Planet? That place is a long way off, isn't it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd thought they'd slink into deep space, make for Elf City, and use its teleportation array to get back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Elf City had a direct connection to Racial Convergence Planet, and that route was far faster than journeying through the boundless expanse of space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had no cause to doubt Kendra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she said Maddox and the others were up in the sky, then they were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Osborne gave the command to the Ascending Sacred Sanctum. "Let's chase after them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the Ascending Sacred Sanctum disappeared from the women's view and rocketed upward into the void at a blistering pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne activated his Satan's Eye, hoping to catch sight of Maddox and his gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, they'd already put some distance between them. Even with the Sacredness Level of his Satan's Eye, he couldn't spot them in the vastness of space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne wasn't worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The distance between Celestara Planet and Racial Convergence Planet was enormous. As long as Maddox and the others didn't have a Sacred Artifact, they wouldn't be able to make the return quickly. He had plenty of time to catch up with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Ascending Sacred Sanctum at his disposal, Osborne was definitely faster than Maddox and his group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Kendra's intuition was right, he'd catch up with them and settle the score.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, the Ascending Sacred Sanctum pierced through Celestara Planet's atmosphere and plunged into the inky, boundless cosmos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite its breakneck speed, the sheer vastness of space made it seem almost sluggish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had it not been for Celestara Planet shrinking rapidly in the rearview, Osborne might not have even noticed the movement of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, they've changed course! Looks like they've caught on that we're hot on their heels!" Kendra said, pointing in another direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a smirk. "Caught on to our pursuit? They've got sharp senses! I hadn't even managed to detect them yet, and they'd already sniffed us out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it's too late for them&mdash;there's no escaping now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He made a slight adjustment to the Ascending Sacred Sanctum's trajectory and continued the chase with a calm yet determined demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, far ahead in the distance, a colossal war blade sliced through space at an astonishing velocity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several figures sat cross-legged atop the blade, their faces etched with grim expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were Maddox and his companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were seven of them in total.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, they had come as eight, but Ricky had been killed by Osborne, leaving just the remaining seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pick up the pace!" Maddox gritted his teeth. "I can feel a threat closing in from behind! It's that damn Osborne&mdash;he must have dealt with Zayne and is now chasing us!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
