  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the voice sounded, everyone in the Augustine family turned their heads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young woman had somehow appeared in the Augustine Estate. She was now staring angrily at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked over and recognized who it was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Her revenge has finally come!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained calm because he knew this revenge was inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He calmly said, "You're alone? Bring out your helpers. By yourself, you won't be able to take revenge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn became furious when she heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she also knew that with her strength, revenge was impossible. Otherwise, she wouldn't have been beaten senseless by Osborne last time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She let out a cold snort and waved her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, several figures appeared beside her. There were six in total, five men and one woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them was Charlie, whom Osborne had met before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't recognize the other five, but they were about the same age as Charlie and carried themselves with pride. Their powerful energy was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"None of them are ordinary people!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne made a quick judgment in his mind and waved his hand, signaling the others to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan was extremely worried. "Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly. "It's alright. I'll be fine. In the coming battle, you won't be able to help. You'll only distract me. They are all at least Class A," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan and the others were reluctant but left anyway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn didn't stop them and sneered. "Osborne, today I will return the humiliation you gave me tenfold! I'm going to smash your face in!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And that divine artifact scepter is mine, too!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Evelynn waved her hand. The six people she brought spread out, surrounding Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression remained calm as he said, "Before we start, aren't you going to introduce yourselves?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn was furious at Osborne's calm demeanor but said, "Since you want to die knowing who we are, I'll grant you that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They are all members of the Power Prodigy Class in Newport City. They are Charlie and Alexander's classmates! When they heard you killed Alexander, they got curious about you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she finished speaking, the only woman among the six giggled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spoke lightly, "Yes, we're curious about you! No matter what, Alexander was our classmate. Even though he was ranked near the bottom in the Power Prodigy Class, the fact that you could kill him and defeat Charlie is impressive. It's worth my effort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, my name is Julia Hayes. Larson Hayes, the one you beat up last time, is my sister! So today, I'm also here to get revenge for her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne heard this and smiled faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to avenge your sister, let's see if you have the strength," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, he looked at the other four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four introduced themselves coldly. Two were from the Augustine family in Newport City. They were not direct descendants, just from branch families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other two were from the Powell family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, now that introductions are over, let's begin! You dared to bully Ms. Augustine, so now you'll pay the price! I'll start first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julia smiled as she finished speaking and stepped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at her and couldn't help but shake his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julia sneered. "What? Are you scared? Do you want to beg for mercy and apologize now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she spoke, Evelynn and the others looked at Osborne with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "No, that's not it. I mean, let's not make this so troublesome. Instead of coming at me one by one, why don't all seven of you come at me together? Let's not waste time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, Evelynn and the other six were stunned. Their faces were filled with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought they had heard wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, their expressions darkened, as if they had been deeply humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We are all geniuses from the Power Prodigy Class in Newport City, at least mid-ranked. Each of us is far stronger than Alexander! And you want us to attack together?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think defeating Alexander makes you something special?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, you'll pay the price for your arrogance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julia was the first to attack. A powerful force erupted from her, and the sky quickly filled with dark clouds. It began to rain, but this was no ordinary rain. Each drop was like a bullet, falling toward Osborne at terrifying speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly. His body remained still.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He simply summoned his martial aura, forming a layer of defense around his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crackle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tat </span><span>tat</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the powerful raindrops hit his martial aura. It was only creating tiny ripples before disappearing completely, unable to harm Osborne at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Julia's expression changed drastically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn was also shocked. She knew Julia's strength was far above Alexander's. Even was a typical Class A+ who wouldn't stand a chance against her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even with such power, Julia couldn't even break through Osborne's defense?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, he's gotten even stronger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's all attack together!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
