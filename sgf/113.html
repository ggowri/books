  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the bodyguards charged towards Austin, Barlyn's panic flared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice thundered. "Stop right there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wesley, are you out of your mind? Do you even know who she is? That's Austin! You touch a hair on her and I'll make sure I take down your entire family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley froze, stunned by Barlyn's outburst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face paled rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! Everyone, stop right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley's voice was now pleading, his bodyguards halting in their tracks just inches from Austin, looking back at him in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were wide with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Up until now, he hadn't recognized Austin; her disguise had thrown him off. But Barlyn's harsh reminder made him realize who she was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization hit him like a ton of bricks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley's face drained of color, and his body shook slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "What have I done?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did I really just insult Austin?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I called her a stupid bitch, said she should be a prostitute in her next life, and even considered letting my bodyguards lay hands on her? I'm finished!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Wesley was gripped by terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the Ashford family was one of the top families in Mayby City, it paled in comparison to the Montague family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Montague family was involved in maritime shipping, and they maintained a massive fleet of elite escorts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ashford family, despite its wealth, would be crushed in a serious conflict with the Montague family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Austin wasn't just any member of the Montague family - she was the sole heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley, with his numerous rivals, couldn't afford to cross her. Offending Austin and the Montague family could easily cost him his claim to the inheritance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley was drenched in sweat as he stammered, "Ms... Ms. Montague, I honestly didn't know it was you. If I had known, I would never have been so disrespectful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cursed Osborne inwardly, thinking, "Why does Osborne always get so lucky?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He managed to worm his way into Alison's good graces, and now he's cozying up to Austin?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That useless fool has all the luck with women!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia, too, was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could she not know Austin? In Mayby City, the most powerful women were Clarissa and Austin, and Austin was Clarissa's close friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia had always envied them, wishing she could get close to either of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she watched as her ex-husband Wesley, who she had always looked down upon, first became Clarissa's savior and bodyguard and now was ingratiating himself with Austin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia couldn't understand why Osborne, whom she had always considered a loser, was mingling with Austin while Wesley was groveling at her feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia bit her lip, her discomfort palpable, especially as she watched Wesley desperately apologizing to Austin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her regret over their divorce grew stronger by the minute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin regarded Wesley with a cold, mocking smile. "Wesley, wasn't it you who called me a stupid bitch? Didn't you say I should be a prostitute in my next life? You even threatened to kill me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Wesley trembled again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was a misunderstanding, Ms. Montague! I truly didn't know the person Osborne brought was you. I apologize sincerely!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin's voice was icy as she roared, "Shut up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dare call Osborne useless? You really need a lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Austin delivered another sharp slap to Wesley's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley was left dumbfounded, as was Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia thought in bewilderment, "Austin has such high status, yet she refers to Osborne so closely, like they're friends? What is going on here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne couldn't hold back his laughter any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, Austin, let's not bother with Mr. Ashford. I've known for a while that his brain isn't working right. You've made your point, and that's enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley's anger flared, but Austin nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, Osborne. I'll do as you say."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she shot Wesley a glare, saying, "Wesley, I have my eye on some uncut diamonds. Can I purchase them? If you dare say no, I'll contact the Wise Order in your family directly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley's body shivered at the threat. "Yes! Of course, Ms. Montague! It's an honor for the Ashford family to have you at our diamond dealing market. I'll personally make sure you get a 20% discount... no, 50% off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley's face showed deep regret, but he was doing his best to appease Austin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that if she took his insult seriously, the Montague family would pressure the Ashford family, and he might lose his inheritance - something he couldn't accept.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin said with a smile, "You're being reasonable now, aren't you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have your people bring over all the uncut diamonds I'm interested in. I want to cut them myself. If any of them don't turn out to be high-quality diamonds, I won't be pleased."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley trembled again at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without daring to protest, he quickly instructed his bodyguards to move the diamonds to the cutting machines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the roar of the cutting machines filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The uncut diamonds were swiftly being processed.</span></p><div class="pagination">
