  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Anastasia and Zoe looked at Osborne, their eyes shining with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blood Demon members, fall back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't even need to speak the words&mdash;his command pulsed directly into the hearts of every Blood Demon member. Instantly, they began to retreat in an orderly fashion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For them, Osborne's orders were not just requests; they were absolute directives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would follow his command without hesitation, even if it led them to their doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the power of Osborne, the progenitor of the Blood Clan&mdash;an authority that commanded utter loyalty from his descendants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Cain's vast memories, there had been countless close calls where he'd escaped deadly pursuers by relying on the unwavering resolve of the Blood Clan's offspring, who had bravely stood against overwhelming foes to buy him precious moments to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Blood Demon members pulled back, the Dark Exotic Beasts, thinking the retreat was a sign of fear, surged forward with reckless abandon, desperate to break free from the fissure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their numbers exceeding a thousand, the cavern quickly felt cramped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but smirk as he watched the chaos unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see what you can do against my newfound strength. Abyssal Spiral!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hand, and dark power erupted at the center of the Dark Exotic Beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A vortex began to materialize, initially small and hardly noticeable. The beasts paid it no mind&mdash;at least not until it expanded rapidly into a swirling maelstrom with a radius of 328 feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within the vortex, dark power churned violently, unleashing a terrifying gravitational </span><span>force. The nearby Dark Exotic Beasts, regardless of whether they were Class S or top-tier Class S, began screeching in horror as they were dragged into the swirling blackness, disappearing without a trace, only leaving behind traces of thick, ominous blood energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Abyssal Spiral continued to grow, quickly reaching a staggering radius of 3280 feet. The sheer force of its gravitational pull was catastrophic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic erupted among the surrounding Dark Exotic Beasts as they desperately flapped their enormous wings, trying to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was no escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once locked onto them by the vortex's consuming power, they could only be pulled in, vanishing into the abyss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First ten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then a hundred! Two hundred! Five hundred! A thousand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Exotic Beasts were swept up relentlessly, their once formidable numbers being reduced to nothing as they were consumed by the Abyssal Spiral.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The area that had once been teeming with these monstrous creatures was now eerily empty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the last remnants of the Abyssal Spiral faded under Osborne's control, it vanished as quickly as it had appeared, as if it had never existed at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not bad!" Osborne thought, satisfaction evident on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this encounter had happened just two days earlier, facing that many Dark Exotic Beasts would have left him unnerved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could have found himself at risk of being overwhelmed. Even if he had managed to defeat them, it would have taken a massive toll on his stamina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now? He merely stood back and, with a single spell&mdash;the Abyssal Spiral&mdash;had effortlessly wiped out over a thousand Class S and top-tier Class S Dark Exotic Beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been surprisingly easy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given his current strength, opponents of that caliber, no matter the numbers, posed little threat to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Anastasia and Zoe were completely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did Osborne just wipe out over a thousand Dark Exotic Beasts with a single move?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of power is this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is this what it means to be a god?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They gasped in shock, their eyes filled with admiration and a deep desire to become like him, to wield such incredible strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, noticing their awe, gently ruffled their hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just work hard in your training, and I'll help you refine your Divine Bone and Divine Flesh. Eventually, I'll help you forge powerful Divine Bodies and elevate you to godhood!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The response from both girls was immediate; their faces lit up with excitement as they nodded earnestly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the Blood Demon members stood nearby, gazing at Osborne with respect and admiration in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew that taking down over a thousand Dark Exotic Beasts as a group of nearly 48 hundred was a daunting task, one that would require endurance and strategy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here was Osborne, casually dispatching them with just one spell!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was beyond impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his hand, the rich blood energy surrounding them began to surge into Osborne's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am the true progenitor of the Blood Clan now! I can enhance the power of the Blood Demon members without relying on the Blood Cross any longer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can directly infuse this blood energy into the Blood Demon members to help them elevate their strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne focused his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the vast reservoir of blood energy within him began to materialize within the Blood Demon members. They didn't even need to absorb it; the energy was already elevating their power levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, several Blood Demon members experienced breakthroughs, soaring into the ranks of top-tier Class S.</span></p><div class="pagination">
