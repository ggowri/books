  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy harvested from over a thousand Class S and higher Dark Exotic Beasts was enough to boost hundreds of Blood Demon members from Class S to the top tier. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne chose to distribute the energy evenly among all members, so only a few reached the top tier. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, everyone felt a significant power boost, their auras radiating newfound strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "I need to get everyone to top-tier Class S as quickly as possible. Plus, I have to complete the third phase of merging with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once that's done, I can let its roots enter the Blood Demon members. Even if they fall in battle, I&rsquo;ll have the power to bring them back. That's when they'll truly be unstoppable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determined, Osborne addressed his loyal followers. "Stay here and handle any Dark Exotic Beasts that show up. Take them down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood!" the Blood Demon members replied in unison, their spirits high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne planned to explore the depths of the other two passageways. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With so many Dark Exotic Beasts around, there had to be a nest nearby. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could wipe it out, it would prevent a disaster and provide a wealth of blood energy, allowing more Blood Demon members to reach their peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just hope there are enough Dark Exotic Beasts in those tunnels. Finding tens of thousands would be a goldmine&mdash;every Blood Demon member could reach top-tier Class S!" he mused, knowing it was a long shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Anastasia and Zoe, he said, "I'm going deeper into the passageways. I might find a Dark Exotic Beast nest that needs to be destroyed. You two should stay here and wait for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both girls frowned at this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia bit her lip. "Osborne, we want to go with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow, considering their request. He was unfamiliar with the deeper passages and worried about their safety if danger struck. But soon, he relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With my current strength, I can handle an Intermediate or even a Superior Deity. Any Dark Exotic Beast nest down there shouldn't be much of a threat now. As long as we're careful, we'll be fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that decision, Osborne nodded. "Alright! But don't stray too far from me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girls smiled brightly at his consent, nodding eagerly. "Got it, Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!" Osborne said, taking their hands and choosing a passage leading further into the depths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dark Exotic Beasts occasionally surged from the depths, some alone, others in groups. Unaware of their fallen comrades, they charged at the trio.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled calmly, and with a thought, massive wings unfurled from his back&mdash;the Nightshade Wings. Over a hundred yards wide, the dark wings suited the spacious underground passage perfectly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the beasts approached, Osborne's Nightshade Wings flapped gently, sending out dark power blasts that tore through the beasts with ease. The Dark Exotic Beasts were cut down instantly, their cries silenced before they could register the threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood energy from the fallen beasts flowed into Osborne, who skillfully redirected it to the Blood Demon members outside. Several felt a powerful surge, their auras expanding as they advanced to elite Class S ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pressed onward with determination. Despite the treacherous tunnels filled with lurking Dark Exotic Beasts, Anastasia and Zoe felt like they were on a leisurely outing. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None dared approach them; Osborne's Nightshade Wings dispatched threats with lethal precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Propelled by his wings, their speed was electrifying. Soon, they reached a fork in the passage. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like the tunnels converge here! I sense a powerful energy pulse further in&mdash;we're close to the Dark Exotic Beast's nest!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He activated Satan's Eye, and the world around him transformed. His vision pierced through layers of earth and stone, revealing a cavernous space three miles deep. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was filled with countless black cocoons lining the walls. Dark Exotic Beasts emerged slowly, their numbers easily over ten thousand. But one cocoon stood out, colossal and ominous in the depths.</span></p><div class="pagination">
