  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, in the Third Estate on the Augustine family's Mount Seven, Isaac, Nathan, and the others all frowned tightly with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isaac, is there no one willing to help? Osborne has been locked up in the dungeon for half a day, and it is so scary. Will he be all right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan was worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac sighed, "I asked several elders from the main bloodline for help and explained the matter. Unfortunately, they all said that they couldn't get involved, as it falls under the Punishment Squad's jurisdiction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that they don't want to offend Matthew because of us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan clenched his fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since they don't dare, let's go find Godfather! Without direct interference in the Augustine family's affairs, he is still the family head! I've heard he's the most fair in his judgments. I don't believe he'll just stand by."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac shook his head. "It's useless! Godfather is on Mount Celestial Reach, which is the forbidden area of the Augustine family. Even the elders from the main bloodline cannot go there. There is no chance for me to meet him at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tomorrow is Godfather's birthday party!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Yulissa said through gritted teeth, "The Augustine family is now getting ready for it. It is said that he prefers to keep things low-key, so only a select few key figures from both the main and branch bloodlines will be invited to the party on Mount Celestial Reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can send some people to participate on behalf of the bloodline in Dampston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, we will be able to meet Godfather!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yulissa, do you intend to bring this up at Godfather's birthday party and let him dispense justice?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa nodded. "This is our only option! At the party, I will tell Godfather in person. I don't believe that he will turn a blind eye to it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he does, we should just leave the Augustine family and cease to be its ninth branch bloodline."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yulissa was firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac, Nathan, and the others were all shocked. "In that case, should we leave the Augustine family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were hesitant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, they thought of Osborne's help to the Dampston branch bloodline. Without him, they might have been destroyed long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay! Let's bring this up at Godfather's birthday party! If he ignores it and refuses to seek justice for Osborne, we will...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just quit the Augustine family!" Isaac said firmly, gritting his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the entire Augustine family was extremely busy preparing for the Godfather's 80th birthday party.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the family head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he hadn't been involved with the Augustine family for years, no one dared to disrespect him. His 80th birthday party was the family's most significant event during this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Godfather requested that they keep the celebration to a simple family dinner. Otherwise, they would have certainly invited all the prominent figures in Rosmandi to his birthday party.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, everyone took the event seriously, as they all desired to leave a good impression on Godfather, especially the top individuals from the younger generation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, Vincent, Matthew, Owen, and Emma all prepared thoroughly and presented themselves at their best, hoping for an opportunity to catch Godfather's eye, impress him, and become his successor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather, the head of the Augustine family, was also the boss of the Draco Group and the king of the Rosmandi's underground world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew that even the heir to the family could only inherit the family's assets, not those of Godfather, such as the Draco Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, on the Augustine family's Mount Two, Vincent, the strongest of the younger generation, had just finished his workout. He wiped his statue-like figure with a towel, full of confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather is eighty years old!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't it time for him to choose a successor?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am the strongest among the younger generation of the Augustine family. With Godfather having no offspring, I am the best candidate if he wants to choose a successor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, I must prove my excellence to him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On Mount Three, Matthew stood at the window of the mansion, staring intently at Mount Celestial Reach, the forbidden area not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The heir to the Augustine family will be me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather's successor will also be me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As the best person, only I can lead both the family and the Draco Group to greater strength. No one else can compete with me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On Mount Four, Owen opened the wooden box. Inside was his elaborate gift for Godfather, in which he had already invested a considerable sum of money.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he felt it was all worth it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tomorrow, I must perform well! As long as I earn the Godfather's favor, it won't matter if I'm not the Augustine family's heir!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To be Godfather's successor is my real goal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On Mount Five, Emma gazed up at the starry sky with her chin resting on her hand, resembling a statue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Emma, tomorrow is Godfather's 80th birthday party. Why don't you get ready? You are the youngest and most talented among all the potential heirs to the Augustine family. You will definitely be chosen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Becoming his successor will make you the queen of the Rosmandi's underground world!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma replied with assurance, "There's no need for preparation. I trust Godfather's vision. He will undoubtedly recognize who stands out as the best!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's me!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
