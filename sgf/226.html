  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely cannot let this massive dimensional rift fully form! Even if I transform into a Vampire, I might not be able to withstand it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face turned grave, the weight of the situation pressing down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Space power is indeed eerie and powerful. It's no wonder it's considered one of the top ten strongest powers by many. It's just too tricky and versatile," Osborne muttered to himself, his mind racing with possibilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Orion's power level far exceeds my own, coupled with the unpredictable nature of space power; I would have been defeated long ago if not for the protection of level three Devil's Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How can I unravel the current situation?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How can I break free from this Dimensional Collapse?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne pondered his next move, he felt the familiar sense of danger creeping up on him once again from behind. It was Orion, utilizing the small dimensional rifts to move behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "You think I'm just a sitting duck for you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that's the case, I'll start by destroying all your small dimensional rifts, leaving you unable to maneuver through space!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes gleamed with cold determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a swift motion, he drew a dark sword from his waist&mdash;the Death's Edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A level one ancient magic weapon, the Death's Edge might have been considered basic in power level, but it far surpassed even the most advanced modern weapons of the Draco Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, it resonated perfectly with Osborne, enhancing the power of the Devil's Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Strike!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne challenged, meeting Orion's attack head-on before swiftly swinging the Death's Edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The yellow Devil's Light, empowered by the sword, radiated a terrifying aura, manifesting into a massive yellow sword light aimed at Orion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impressive power, but it's useless if you can't hit me, isn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift movement, he vanished into another dimensional rift, evading Osborne's attack effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The yellow sword light sliced through the dimensional rift, shattering it into fragments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The momentum continued as it sliced through more rifts one after another, finally dissipating after several strikes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that direction, no more dimensional rifts remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion was momentarily stunned, his overconfident demeanor faltering as he realized Osborne's attack had decimated his defenses with just a single strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze fell upon the seemingly inconspicuous dark sword in Osborne's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, his expression shifted to one of shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An ancient magic weapon of the Chevalier family? You... you are the one who killed Apollo! You are the owner of Skyefall Security Services?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne swiftly swung his sword, slicing through a dozen or so smaller dimensional rifts in a single direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cold smile spoke volumes. "That's right&mdash;it's me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion's face hardened. "Very well! So, you are the one. I must thank you. If you hadn't killed Apollo, I wouldn't have had the chance to marry Clarissa!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, by defeating you, Clarissa will be mine! Hahaha!" Orion's laughter rang out, filled with malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression remained icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think you're worthy of Clarissa? You're probably not going to live long enough to dream about it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, Osborne struck again, slicing through another cluster of small dimensional rifts. As each rift was destroyed, Orion's attempts to attack from behind became increasingly challenging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion's face twisted with a cold rage, but his confidence remained unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced towards the impending formation of the colossal dimensional rift, a malevolent smile forming on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha! You're done for! My Dimensional Collapse is about to take shape! Even a Class A martial master or a power master wouldn't dare face it head-on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, prepare to meet your end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion stood there, arms crossed, watching as the colossal dimensional rift loomed closer to formation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, it swirled a chilling pull, a terrifying force that made it feel like a black hole threatening to devour everything in its path. Osborne could sense the increasing difficulty of moving, each attempt feeling like he was stuck in molasses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he got sucked into that rift, he wouldn't just disappear&mdash;his very existence would be erased, leaving nothing behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "I can't keep holding back any longer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've got to take out Orion if I want to stop this bizarre dimensional rift from fully forming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that determination sparking in his mind, Osborne channeled the power of his Blood Cross tattoo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vampire! Transform!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His short hair began to lengthen wildly, cascading into a fluid mane of blood-red locks, each strand resembling fresh crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A pair of sharp fangs emerged from his mouth, glinting ominously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fingers elongated into claws as sharp as daggers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even his face took on a more sculpted, pale appearance, resembling a haunting vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne pulled out all the stops.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion's words dripped with a cold confidence, his malice clear. "Transforming into the Vampire? I've seen it before. But I never pegged you as a three-power metahuman! Someone like you, if allowed to grow, could become a real nightmare. But you still won't escape your fate! Even in this form, you're as good as dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It won't be long now; just ten seconds and my Dimensional Collapse will be fully formed! Once it does, unless you're a Class A master, no one's walking away from it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those menacing eyes locked on Osborne, it was clear that Orion saw him as a threat that needed to be eliminated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne could feel an overwhelming sense of danger closing in on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The one who's going to die is you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he lunged towards Orion, unleashing every ounce of his strength.</span></p><div class="pagination">
