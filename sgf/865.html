  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everett, Rumen, Marlon, and Ebony stood before Wesson, their faces twisted into smug smiles.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had long coveted the rare metals of Rosmandi, but the previous Sebastian had been a formidable barrier, staunchly refusing any collaboration and outright banning the export of various rare metals.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite the League of Divine Descent's overwhelming power compared to the Augustine family and the Draco Group, they were bound by the global agreements that prevented them from waging war against either.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These agreements had been established two decades ago by an emerging superpower that called itself the Court of the Sun.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It had gathered every major force on the planet for a summit, laying down the law: no superpower could wage war over resources.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anyone who dared to violate this pact would face retribution from the Court.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At first, many scoffed at the Court of the Sun, believing it lacked the authority to enforce such rules on a global scale.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During the meeting, over twenty Class S Supreme Overlords had banded together to reject the agreement outright.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But their arrogance was short-lived.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Court sent a single representative who swiftly and ruthlessly dispatched every one of those Supreme Overlords without breaking a sweat, leaving no survivors.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, fear gripped the hearts of all present.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ultimately, every superpower, even those operating from the shadows, signed the global agreements, pledging not to wage war over resources and ensuring world peace.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the years that followed, a few superpowers still attempted to engage in covert conflicts over resources, but they met with disastrous ends.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't long before agents of the Court of the Sun appeared, wiping out entire factions.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The enforcer known as the Shadow Killer operated from the darkness, eliminating anyone daring enough to defy the global agreements.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No one knew the Shadow Killer's true identity or had ever seen his face.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, he ranked second in the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings, only surpassed by Helios Thornberry.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a series of brutal purges by the Shadow Killer, no superpower was willing to risk violating the agreements&mdash;not even the powerful League of Divine Descent.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thus, while they eyed the rare metals of Rosmandi with greed, they dared not initiate a war, opting instead to leverage the Aberrants to intimidate Wesson.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Had Sebastian not been injured and still at the peak of his power, he would never have bowed to the League's threats.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But with his absence, the situation had shifted dramatically.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumen asked coolly, his gaze fixed on Wesson, "Have you made up your mind?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you agree to our terms and let the League of Divine Descent help develop the rare metals of Rosmandi, your Draco Group will still pocket at least thirty percent of the profits. But if you refuse...</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then we'll have no choice but to assist the Aberrants in wiping out your Draco Group and the Augustine family. At that point, you'll be left with nothing, and everyone will pay the price."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson felt a surge of frustration, his jaw clenched tightly as he replied, "This is too big for me to decide on my own! I need to contact the Godfather, but I can't reach him right now."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumen snorted dismissively, saying, "Are you trying to buy time? It won't work! But I won't push you. I'll give you five days to contact the Godfather and make your decision.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Five days from now coincides with your Honor Quest Ceremony. Once it wraps up, I expect an answer from you!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I don't hear from you, I'll take it as a flat-out rejection and proceed to team up with Gerardo.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your choice will determine whether you're allies or enemies."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumen concluded with a cold smile, turning to leave.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Marlon spoke up, a casual grin on his face, "Father, there's no need to rush off. I've made some progress in my training and am looking for a worthy opponent to spar with. Mr. Wesson Augustine here seems like a perfect candidate.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You won't refuse, right, Mr. Wesson Augustine?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson's expression soured at the challenge. "You want to fight me?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marlon smiled slightly, unfazed. "Is that a problem? The top ten on the Godson Rankings have all faced Class S opponents and even defeated them. I want to test my mettle, too!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, a fierce determination ignited in his eyes, signaling his readiness for battle.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rumen and Everett exchanged amused glances, their expressions almost mocking.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Come on, Wesson. You wouldn't back down from a challenge, would you? After all, as a senior, it's only right to guide the younger generation," they taunted, their gazes laden with a veiled threat.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson's fists tightened with simmering rage. Rumen and Everett were forcing him into a corner, pushing him to fight Marlon.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had never felt this trapped, not when Sebastian was present.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, there was no escape this time.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fine! Let's do this!" Wesson snapped, determination igniting within him.</p><div class="pagination">
