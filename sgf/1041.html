  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get in there!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a forceful shove, Gerardo threw Osborne into the culture tank. Osborne's face turned pale with panic as he realized he had no idea how to escape this situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why Isa didn&rsquo;t show up?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the crimson-red culture fluid crept closer, he felt like he was being lowered into an "oil pan". Struggling was futile; he was sinking into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, one more thing," Gerardo sneered. "These culture fluids are exceptionally potent. The transformation they'll induce in your body will be ten times more intense than ordinary fluids! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Lord can endure six days in regular culture without being enslaved, but I doubt he'd last one day in this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, with that intensity comes tenfold the pain! You'd better hold on. I have no intention of enslaving your consciousness just yet. But if you can't withstand the agony and succumb too soon, that's on you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enjoy your transformation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope you can endure longer, and emerge stronger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne plunged completely into the culture medium.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it..." he cursed, but his words were swallowed by the thick fluid surrounding him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crimson liquid filled his vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt something really bad would happen. But he couldn&rsquo;t do anything about it. His fate was entirely in Gerardo's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Power on, maximum power!" Gerardo's cold voice echoed in the room, and it was the last thing Osborne heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the machine powering the culture tank was activated, a sudden tinnitus hit him, rendering him deaf to everything else. In that instant, Osborne felt the culture fluid was changing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The culture fluid before just seemed to make him feel uneasy, and his body did not react to it at all. But now, after the machine was powered on, Osborne felt that the culture fluid seemed to have instantly transformed into something terrifyingly hot, like molten magma, searing his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt the urge to scream, but the instant he opened his mouth, the viscous fluid flooded in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What did it feel like when magma entered your mouth?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't know it before, but now he knew it. Suddenly, a burning sensation coursed down his throat and into his stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain was so intense it made his body tremble uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crimson liquid seemed to penetrate every pore in his skin, invading his flesh and even his internal organs. It felt as though every inch of his body was aflame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that overwhelming agony, he thought he might lose consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, strangely, something in the fluid stimulated his mental strength and spirit, preventing him from slipping away into unconsciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The excruciating pain assaulted both his body and soul. Even though Osborne considered himself remarkably tolerant of pain, he felt on the verge of collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After enduring this torment, he believed he could withstand any pain that might follow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body was shaking violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he was unaware that he was undergoing a dramatic transformation as he absorbed the crimson fluid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This culture medium was added with the heart blood of six gods, blended in precise </span><span>proportions with ancient medicine and rare minerals. It had unfathomable power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he was suffering immensely, his body was rapidly evolving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always been exceptionally strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he was the first to fuse his soul of powers with body. As a Class AAA warrior, he could easily take down a Class S due to his sheer physical prowess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet now, his body was growing even stronger in a fast speed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the massive culture tank, Gerardo watched Osborne with a mix of anticipation and anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give me data!" he commanded, and immediately, a dozen lab-coated technicians rushed into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One technician looked up in disbelief. "Initial physical strength is nine! Energy utilization rate is at 99.9%! Improvement speed is increasing by one per hour, with an enslavement rate of one percent per hour. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Estimated time for complete enslavement is one hundred hours. By then, his physical strength will reach a minimum of 109, over ten times than before!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's shocked, too. "His initial physical strength is nine? This can't be right! A typical person just promoted to Class S usually only has a strength of one! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's only Class AAA, yet his strength is already at nine?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's the strength of a veteran Class S!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
