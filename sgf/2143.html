  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isidore! I swear I will kill you! I will kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's voice was a raw, anguished roar, echoing through the cave. It had been a long time since he had felt such unbridled fury. Watching Alfreda sacrifice herself to absorb Isidore's lethal attack left his heart feeling as if it had been crushed in a vice, the pain almost unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Why was Alfreda so foolish?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she didn't think she could withstand Isidore's power, she could have just told me! We could have come up with another plan! Why did she have to throw her life away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was consumed by self-loathing, hating his own weakness, </span><span>and </span><span>despising the fact that he had failed to see Alfreda's intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guilt of her death weighed heavily on him. Though they had known each other for a short time, he had come to consider her his closest friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, her loss filled him with a profound sense of regret and an all-consuming rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized he couldn't bring Alfreda back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he had feared, despite having copied her life essence, the unique power of Isidore prevented him from using the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to resurrect her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that Alfreda was truly gone, forever lost to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body trembled violently, his fury nearly eclipsing his reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need revenge! I have to avenge Alfreda!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, even in his rage, he knew that he couldn't take Isidore down alone. The thought of confronting even a fragment of Isidore's soul was daunting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To tackle Isidore's spirit, he would need the power of Umbra Earth lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination, Osborne took action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lightning, heed my call!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne channeled all his strength to fully activate the Level Ten lightning elemental essence, attempting to gain control over the terrifying, constantly-erupting lightning hovering above his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt it&mdash;the faint tendrils of Umbra Earth lightning responding to his command, </span><span>descending from the stormy sky and dancing between his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it was a mere wisp of lightning, Osborne could sense its potency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was different from ordinary lightning&mdash;more explosive, </span><span>and </span><span>more powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isidore, I'm coming for you!" he growled, his gaze fixed on the cave entrance, where Isidore stood, unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's self-detonation had failed to harm Isidore, and now he was closing in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasted no time; he unleashed his attack without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dark red bolt of lightning erupted from nowhere, summoned by Osborne's will. He flicked his wrist, directing the Umbra Earth lightning into the dark red surge, merging them into a single, formidable strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isidore scoffed, his expression dripping with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still struggling at this point? You think that pathetic attack can hurt me? How laughable! Princess Alfreda is dead, and now it's your turn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isidore barely regarded Osborne's assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his perception, the lightning strike was a far cry from the ten arrows that had come before. Even without defense, he was certain he wouldn't be harmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual wave of his hand, Isidore conjured a faint barrier that stood like an impenetrable wall against Osborne's dark red lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile crept across Isidore's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, human, it's time for you to join her! Don't keep Princess Alfreda waiting in hell too long. After all, she died to save you. Are you really going to let her suffer alone down there?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just hit the road to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face darkened, but he ignored Isidore's taunts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he focused on the chaotic lightning crackling overhead, his mind racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why isn't anything happening?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've infused my attack with Umbra Earth lightning. Even though it hasn't harmed Isidore at all, I at least made contact with his defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to my plan, the moment the Umbra Earth lightning touched Isidore's power, he should have been unable to hide his presence anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was supposed to be struck by the Umbra Earth lightning, banished, </span><span>and </span><span>erased!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouldn't even have been allowed to step foot on this Umbra Earth continent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that moment, everything was eerily calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Umbra Earth lightning hung in the air, flickering just like before, with no special reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "What's going on? Could it be that my plan has failed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda died for this plan, and now it's all gone to waste?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Umbra Earth lightning is completely unresponsive to Isidore's presence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, am I next in line to die?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can't use the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity's power to bring back Alfreda, and if Isidore kills me, I won't be able to come back either!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'll be completely finished!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, a wave of intense frustration surged within Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want to die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were still so many things he needed to accomplish, so many debts to settle for Alfreda!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't die at Isidore's hands!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne had already exhausted his last reserves of power to summon the Umbra Earth lightning; facing Isidore now, how could he possibly survive?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough wasting time with you! It's your turn to go to hell!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should only blame yourselves for seeing things you shouldn't have! The secret of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum must not leak out while it's in my hands!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Isidore made his move, flicking his finger lightly. Instantly, a beam of light shot toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The light wasn't particularly strong, but at this point, Osborne had no way to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only watch helplessly as the beam closed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time seemed to slow to a crawl at that moment, and Osborne felt death creeping closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this it? Am I really going to die? I'm sorry, Alfreda! I can't avenge you after all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood there, bracing himself for the inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, everything changed. At the moment Isidore's attack was about to strike Osborne down, a terrifying bolt of lightning suddenly descended from the sky, striking down with pinpoint accuracy and shattering Isidore's attack into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that was just the beginning!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dark clouds began to swirl ominously overhead, rolling in from all directions. A cacophony of crackling lightning gathered furiously in the sky above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart soared with hope as he looked up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Umbra Earth lightning was responding!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Isidore's expression turned grim, his shock and anger evident as he stared at the tumultuous clouds above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt as if he had been locked onto!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The furious storm of clouds and lightning had honed in on him, a terrifying pressure weighing down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he was a soul form of an Empyrean Sacredness warrior, he trembled under this overwhelming force, his knees buckling slightly as if he were about to kneel.</span></p><div class="pagination">
