  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone felt the tension rising as anxiety gripped the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zoe bit her lip, her expression turning serious. "Osborne, I have one last trick up my sleeve that we can try! But I've never attempted it before, so I can't guarantee it'll work!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes brightened with intrigue. "What's the plan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zoe said, "I need to borrow your soul power! I have a technique that allows me to channel someone else's soul power for an attack. But the person lending me their power has to trust me completely and let me control it. If there's any doubt, the soul power will resist, and not only will I get hurt, but so will the person who lent it to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She turned her gaze to Osborne, her eyes searching. "So, do you trust me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A smile broke across Osborne's face as he ruffled Zoe's hair affectionately. "Of course I trust you! Let's give it a shot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lending his soul power to Zoe was no small feat; it meant placing his life in her hands. If Zoe chose to, she could easily shatter his Soul Current Ocean and leave him a fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most people would hesitate in such a situation; even those closest to them would have reservations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne was different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His trust in Zoe was unwavering, and more importantly, he didn't care if his Soul Current Ocean got damaged!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Worst-case scenario, he could always rely on the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to rebuild it. With the Lotus by his side, he wasn't afraid of death, let alone a little injury to his Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without a second thought, Osborne agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Osborne's unwavering faith in her, Zoe felt a rush of gratitude. "Great! Osborne, let your Soul Current Ocean flow freely and let my soul power in! I'll handle the rest!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's do this! We need to act fast; we can't let Caesar slip away! If he escapes the Eclipse Realm, he'll immediately call for reinforcements from the Paramount Supreme Clan and other powerful factions. We won't stand a chance then!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Right! I'm on it!" Zoe replied, determination in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a hum, Osborne suddenly felt a surge of soul power entering his mind, racing toward his Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It felt akin to a soul attack. Normally, he would have instinctively blocked this intrusion; allowing it to enter could lead to catastrophic damage to his Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this time, he cleared his mind and didn't resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a result, Zoe's soul power flowed effortlessly into Osborne's Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!" Zoe gasped suddenly, causing everyone to turn their anxious eyes toward her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Osborne felt a jolt of concern, fearing she had been hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's wrong?" they all asked, worry etched on their faces as they watched Zoe's astonished expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's... it's nothing!" Zoe quickly reassured them, swallowing hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She continued, "It's just that Osborne's Soul Current Ocean is massive! His soul power is golden! I've never seen such an enormous soul power before. I thought mine was strong, but Osborne's is at least ten times more powerful! I was just taken aback for a moment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Relief washed over the group as they processed her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They turned toward Osborne, their gazes filled with awe, as if they were staring at a monster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They all knew just how powerful Zoe's soul power was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a soul elemental user, she had once unleashed a soul power attack that put each of them in a tight spot&mdash;even the strongest among them, Anastasia, had found herself on the receiving end of Zoe's formidable ability, barely escaping without serious harm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zoe's soul power was already impressive, but now, seeing the immense golden power that emanated from Osborne, she felt a mix of disbelief and admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Zoe's abilities were noteworthy, Osborne's left her completely astonished&mdash;his soul power was at least ten times greater than hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, feeling their scrutiny, rubbed his nose sheepishly. "Having strong soul power doesn't mean much if I can't wield it effectively. I mostly use it for defense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others exchanged glances, disappointment flickering in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If only you had mastered soul power attacks too, your enemies would be in for a real headache!" one of them remarked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne considered their words, a thought sparking in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You know, maybe I should practice using soul power offensively as well! My Satan's Eye can utilize soul power attacks, but it hasn't been very effective compared to my other elemental powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With this kind of soul power at my fingertips, it would be a shame not to make the most of it. I'll have to look into some soul power techniques and see if I can't level up my own skills!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that realization, he turned to Zoe. "Stop dawdling! Get moving! My Spatial Clone can't hold Caesar much longer; he's about to make a break for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Okay!" Zoe snapped out of her reverie, her confidence surging. "Caesar won't get away! With your powerful soul power backing me up, even though he's at the late Deity King level, he's done for!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Time to go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Osborne felt the massive surge of his soul power being channeled by Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She parted her lips slightly, directing her soul power attack toward Caesar.</span></p><div class="pagination">
