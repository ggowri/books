  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo didn't just look like an ordinary person; his speech was also quite amiable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled and said, "You've just arrived today, so I won't assign any tasks for now. Everyone can go and rest properly. Starting tomorrow, you'll begin carrying out assignments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I believe you've heard about Divine Peak Nine before coming here and know how hazardous it is. What I need to tell you is that the rumors you've heard are false."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone couldn't help but exclaim in surprise upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The rumors are false?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does that mean Divine Peak Nine isn't as dangerous as people say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo gave a faint smile and said, "The situation at Divine Peak Nine is ten or even a hundred times more dangerous than the rumors you've heard. So, when you arrive here, your life is no longer entirely your own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Many of you will die here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Therefore, from now on, all of you must train relentlessly, improve, and complete your missions. If you don't want to die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Angelo finished speaking, everyone was stunned, staring at him with their mouths agape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Angelo smiled and continued, "Of course, performing tasks near Divine Peak Nine is extremely perilous, but it also offers greater opportunities for achievement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you can return alive, almost all of you will accumulate enough merits to be promoted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, strive to survive! Additionally, you are all elite soldiers of the Wild Flame Army. Don't disgrace the name of the Wild Flame Army. The Inferno Army, </span><span>Thunderwind</span><span> Army, and Firestorm Army soldiers are both your comrades and your competitors. When working with them on missions, you represent the Wild Flame Army. If anyone brings shame to the Wild Flame Army and makes me lose face, I'll make sure they pay with their lives!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dismissed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Angelo spoke, he waved his hand and left quickly, accompanied by the two generals behind him, Edison and Ben, as well as the five deputy generals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at each other in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Athena then spoke to Osborne and others, "You've all heard what Vice Commander Angelo Royston said. At the Divine Peak Nine base, there aren't many rules outside of mission times. Everyone is free to do as they please, even leaving the base if you're not afraid of death, but during missions, you must appear promptly; otherwise, it's considered desertion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To sum it up, while you're here, you only need to do three things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First, execute orders absolutely and complete tasks unconditionally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Second, don't disgrace the name of the Wild Flame Army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Third, survive. Did you all understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good, dismissed! Tomorrow morning at seven, the first batch of tasks will be assigned. Initially, the tasks will be relatively simple and safer, but don't take them lightly, as many people die in these seemingly easy missions. I hope you can live longer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Athena also left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waved his hand and let his subordinates leave to do as they pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation inside the Divine Peak Nine base was somewhat different from what Osborne had anticipated. He had thought that with more than 400 thousand elite warriors gathered from the four military divisions, they would launch a large-scale operation against Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many others also shared this belief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, upon arriving here, Osborne discovered that it wasn't quite like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that the timing hasn't come yet?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whatever the case, I need to get a handle on the situation here as soon as possible! With such a high casualty rate, there must be a reason behind it. I don't want to die here without even understanding what's going on. Plus, Athena is definitely plotting </span><span>against me and will likely assign the most dangerous tasks to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I don't know the lay of the land, I might get played and not even realize it until it's too late!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these thoughts in mind, Osborne returned to his stone hut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to understand the situation here but didn't need to find out himself. He discreetly commanded his two thousand Blood Clan subordinates to gather information. All Osborne had to do was wait for their reports to come in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These two thousand Blood Clan members had diverse backgrounds, and many of them were familiar with some of the seasoned veterans here. They would gather information much faster than Osborne ever could on his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hence, after issuing orders, Osborne continued his training in the stone hut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Peak Nine was perilous, and Osborne's sole reliance was his own strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stronger he was, the safer he would be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lightning elemental essence and space elemental essence are both at a breakthrough bottleneck. However, space elemental essence is more critical! If I can break through to Level Seven, my survival capabilities will significantly increase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But elemental essence breakthroughs to Level Seven are incredibly difficult! Perhaps I should first focus on breaking through with lightning elemental essence. At least it will enhance my </span><span>publically</span><span> perceived strength."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking this through, Osborne began enhancing his lightning elemental essence once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But barely had he entered the state of training when he abruptly opened his eyes again, his face showing obvious shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Something's off! The cosmic energy here is not right!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
