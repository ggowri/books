  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne poured every ounce of his strength into a single, explosive attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air crackled with energy, sending shockwaves radiating outward in all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the blink of an eye, a figure was sent flying across the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He soared through the air, while Isa took a couple of casual steps back, her expression as calm as ever, completely unaffected by the force of his strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne landed heavily on the arena floor, feeling completed drained of strength. Blood spilled from his mouth as he collapsed, his body refusing to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> this is what defeat felt like.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had given it all</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>no holds barred, even unleashing the power of his right leg's Divine Bone. But in the end, all he managed to do was push Isa back a couple of steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it was a resounding defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before today, Osborne had felt somewhat confident, believing he had a decent shot</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>maybe a thirty or forty percent chance</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>of taking Isa down. He thought, at the very least, they would have a nail-biter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, seeing the reality of the battle, he realized just how formidable Isa truly was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no contest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wry smile, Osborne slowly sat up, shaking his head in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Isa approached him. As he opened his mouth ready to speak, she beat him to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won!" Isa declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne blinked in confusion. "What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said, you won! I lost. Your last move forced me to tap into a stronger power, which means I broke our agreement. So, by the rules we set, I'm the one who lost," Isa explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pouted slightly. "Should I have known you'd level up this fast, I wouldn't had agreed to hold back! Now that you've beaten me, you're definitely going to pull some mischief on me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was left speechless, trying to wrap his head around her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "I won?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But... Isa just pushed me around! How could I be the winner when I felt completely helpless?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Isa didn't give him a chance to process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grabbed his arm and pulled him to his feet. "Come on, stop </span><span>looking</span><span> like an idiot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaning closer, she whispered in his ear, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that you've won, what are you planning to do with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Heat rushed to Osborne's cheeks at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa found it amusing, chuckling. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, I'm not leaving today. I'll be waiting for you in your room! If you miss this chance, you might not get another one! Don't keep me waiting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She dashed away from the arena, her voice echoing behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I concede!" Isa shouted, not caring about the stunned expressions of the crowd as she quickly disappeared from view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood there, dumbfounded, watching her leaving figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the spectators below snapped back to reality, erupting into a frenzy of chatter and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa conceded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To them, it was baffling. They had seen Osborne struggle against Isa, taking hit after hit, never gaining the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could she declare herself the loser?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the members of the Augustine family, who should have been celebrating, felt a strange mix of emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Isa might have conceded, they all knew that Osborne still had a long way to go before he could truly stand on equal footing with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This victory didn't feel like a victory at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but wear a wry smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had hoped to defeat Isa today, to prove himself, but instead, he was left with a stark reminder of just how far apart they were in strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll get her later," Osborne thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Jackie stepped onto the arena, eyeing Osborne with a peculiar expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hereby declare the end of Osborne's Honor Quest Ceremony! No one has defeated him, making Osborne the fourth person to successfully clear the Honor Quest Ceremony!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished speaking, members of the Augustine family </span><span>bursted</span><span> in cheers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from the fierce battle between Osborne and Isa, his performance was nothing short of astounding. He was like a legendary figure rising swiftly to prominence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he'd been thoroughly beaten by Isa, the spectacle had brought them a sense of pride. It was clear to anyone with eyes that there was something special between Isa and Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He did it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne has perfectly completed the Honor Quest Ceremony!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a sigh of relief. No matter how ridiculous Isa's eventual concession might seem, according to the rules, he had secured a victory. He had successfully completed Sebastian's Seventh Inheritance Trial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the audience began to leave, Osborne glanced up at the audience stands, sensing the weight of their gazes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen and Everett were watching him intently, their expressions gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't say a word but quickly exited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne exhaled, feeling a mix of tension and relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, his Draco Star Wristlet vibrated, catching Osborne's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked down, surprise flickering across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "So soon? My Honor Quest Ceremony just ended, and now I'm getting the rewards for the Seventh Inheritance Trial?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surprised, Osborne quickly checked the rewards awaiting him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
