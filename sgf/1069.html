  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound that filled the air was nothing more than the sigh of an ordinary old man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, in that instant, everyone froze in their tracks. Even Gerardo's expression hardened, his body going rigid as uncertainty washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Class S warriors from the League of Divine Descent and the Eityreia Organization mirrored his shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battlefield, once alive with the sounds of combat, fell eerily silent as tens of thousands of fighters paused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You lot are making too much noise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man's voice rang out again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's him! The mysterious powerhouse hiding within the Augustine Estate!" Everett from the League of Divine Descent shouted, his voice filled with a mix of awe and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armstrong raised an eyebrow, his silence betraying a heightened sense of alertness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo scoffed, his bravado unshaken. He said, "Who's trying to play tricks here? Let me make this clear: no matter who shows up today, they won't save the Augustine family! They're all going down&mdash;every last one of them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man's voice turned icy, laced with authority. "Arrogant fool! You, who barely scrape the bottom of the divine realm through underhanded means, dare speak to me like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unwise!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the words left the old man's lips, a blinding beam of white light erupted from thin air, hurtling straight toward Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer force radiating from the light was terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's face paled in an instant as he unleashed his power, desperately trying to block the incoming attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, he was sent flying backward, a massive gaping wound torn into his chest. His body twisted violently, as if trying to escape the merging state with the divine corpse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock and fear etched across Gerardo's features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, after the initial attack, no follow-up strike came. He quickly suppressed the injuries, though his expression remained brooding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All around, stunned silence settled like a heavy fog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone present understood just how powerful Gerardo was. Wesson wielded the Godfather's scepter with lethal precision, capable of taking down dozens of Class S clones with each strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such destructive capability was beyond the reach of ordinary top-tier Class S fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here was Wesson, completely ensnared by Gerardo, who had him at a disadvantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If things continued this way, defeat was inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's strength surpassed that of typical top-tier Class S fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone present, including Armstrong from the League of Divine Descent and Sin from the Eityreia Organization, knew they couldn't match Gerardo's level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, witnessing this mysterious figure's single devastating blow to Gerardo left them all in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the mysterious figure hadn't stopped after that initial strike, Gerardo might well have been dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A collective shock rippled through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armstrong and Sin exchanged tense glances, their faces paling as they drew back, retreating from the battlefield and even out of the Augustine family's territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the war came to an unexpected halt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greyson, Bryce, and the others, who had been teetering on the edge of despair, suddenly found a glimmer of hope with this powerful ally's arrival. Seizing the opportunity, they rallied the remaining forces, forming a protective barrier around their comrades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The coalition forces, which had once numbered over 40 thousand, now stood at barely 20 thousand&mdash;more than half had fallen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From nearly 50 Class S fighters, less than 30 remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The toll was staggering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The carnage was simply horrific.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the 100 thousand combat drones and battle robots had dwindled to fewer than 30 thousand, while out of the four thousand energy cannons, a staggering eighty percent lay in ruins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the ranks of the Blood Demon members remained remarkably intact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their cohesion was exceptional, with over four thousand eight hundred fighters moving in perfect harmony on the battlefield. No matter how fierce the attack was, they stood united, deflecting blows together. Coupled with the regenerative properties of the Crystal of Life, their losses were nearly negligible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they were also feeling the strain. Maintaining such high-intensity combat was taking a toll.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the fighting persisted, they, too, would face significant casualties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the enemy was also reeling from heavy losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Aberrants had started with nearly 50 thousand troops, but now they barely had 20 thousand left. Among the three thousand Human Slaves, over two thousand had perished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the eight hundred Class S clones had dwindled to just over three hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Aberrants' forces, just like the coalition's, had suffered monumental setbacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it hadn't been for the sudden intervention of the League of Divine Descent and the Eityreia Organization, the coalition forces might have stood a fighting chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But alas, there were no "what ifs" in war.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both the League of Divine Descent and the Eityreia Organization had brought a hundred Class S fighters each to the fray. Although they had sustained some losses, those were minimal&mdash;fewer than ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the battle lines re-formed, it became evident that the coalition forces were still at a glaring disadvantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't possibly contend with the over three hundred Class S clones from the Aberrants and the nearly two hundred Class S fighters on the opposing side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their only glimmer of hope rested on that mysterious individual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo scoffed again, gritting his teeth as he glared toward the Challenge Peak of the Augustine family, anger and insanity swirling in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell are you? Why meddle in my affairs with the Augustine family?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
