  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the five top-tier Class S warriors from the League of Divine Descent, Reginald was by far the strongest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held the seventeenth position on the Quasi-Divine Rankings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made him the highest-ranked opponent Osborne had ever faced among the elite Class S warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reginald's power was indeed formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne even thought that, compared to Gerardo, who had merged with the corpse of two gods, Reginald was either on par or possibly even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reginald's strength was simply overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's martial art aura couldn't entirely block Reginald's attacks, but fortunately, his physical resilience was exceptional. Although he sustained injuries, they were not serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the two fighters separated once more, Osborne wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, his expression still icy and calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Reginald looked absolutely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe what he was seeing. He had put all his power into his attacks, aiming to quickly eliminate Osborne and escape, but Osborne had managed to withstand everything he threw at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even worse, Osborne hadn't suffered any significant injuries!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reginald was in utter disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's energy clearly indicated that he had only recently broken through to Class S, a type of opponent that Reginald could have easily defeated and killed in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, while he could still shatter Osborne's martial art aura, his attacks were reduced by about fifty percent in potency, leaving the remaining force insufficient to inflict serious harm on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's physical durability was simply on another level, almost like that of a beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reginald's eyes filled with murderous intent. He realized that Osborne's abilities were far beyond his expectations. Considering Osborne's youth and potential, if he didn't kill him now and allowed him to grow stronger...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, no one could stand against Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I must kill him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He must die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Reginald unleashed his full power once again, channeling all his strength into a ferocious attack aimed at obliterating Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, Osborne was mostly on the defensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as the battle wore on, he began to adapt to Reginald's fighting style, handling the attacks with increasing ease and even launching more counterattacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even had a moment to glance around at the broader situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian had Everett fully suppressed. Despite Everett's impressive skills, he was no match for Sebastian. Sebastian, having not only recovered his peak form but surpassed it, was now at least thirty percent stronger than Everett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, despite holding the upper hand, killing Everett would still take some time since Everett's survival instincts were strong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other side, the situation for Wesson, Bryce, and the rest was not as good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The seven Class S warriors were facing off against three top-tier Class S warriors from the League of Divine Descent. Although these three were not as strong as Reginald or Everett, they were still top-tier, far stronger than the seven they were up against.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of the seven, only Bryce, wielding the Trident of Poseidon, was managing to hold his ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle was intense, and the seven were clearly struggling, sustaining numerous injuries as they tried to fend off their opponents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing this, Osborne's expression turned serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to speed things up! Otherwise, those seven won't be able to hold on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a determined focus, Osborne locked his gaze on Reginald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll deal with him first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne unleashed his full power, transforming into a Vampire. Utilizing the Breath of Celestial and the power of the Divine Bone in his right leg, he delivered a devastating kick to Reginald's torso, sending him flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reginald spat out blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face showed sheer disbelief as he looked at Osborne, realizing that Osborne hadn't even been using his full strength before!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of monster is this?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the entire League of Divine Descent, aside from our leader and Helios, there might be no one who could match him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reginald was shaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne didn't stop his assault. His right eye suddenly flashed with an intense, piercing light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Medusa's Gaze! Petrify!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The petrification effect hit Reginald almost instantly, and although he managed to break free of it in a moment, that brief delay was all Osborne needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God Binding Rope! Go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pulled out a peculiar divine artifact. It looked like a tool resembling both a whip and a rope. While Reginald was still affected by the lingering effects of the petrification power, the artifact shot forward like a bolt of lightning, binding Reginald's body tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, Reginald's face twisted in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that he could barely feel his own power anymore; his body was paralyzed, with only his eyes and tongue still able to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell is this thing? Get out of my body!" Reginald roared in rage, desperately trying to expel the God Binding Rope from his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Reginald's struggle, Osborne's face grew stern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even the God Binding Rope can't hold you? Then let's add a little more pressure!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne's long, blood-red hair began to grow wildly, shooting forward like tendrils and piercing into Reginald's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Reginald's body went completely rigid, paralyzed beyond recovery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the combined restraint of the God Binding Rope and Osborne's blood-red hair, Reginald could no longer muster any of his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been captured alive!</span></p><div class="pagination">
