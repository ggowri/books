  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne decisively threw in the towel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had not unleashed his full strength yet and had not even used half of his strength. He still had considerable confidence in continuing to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he no longer wanted to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was right. His techniques for fighting with enemies were too crude. Most of the time, he used his force to crush the enemy or used many means to make the enemy unable to adapt, and then he won.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for techniques, he had almost none.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had his forces for a month at most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this month, his strength had improved by leaps and bounds, which was much greater than the improvement of others in ten or twenty years. How could he possibly take into account both techniques and forces?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he gave in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to defeating Isa, he preferred to learn fighting techniques from Isa. Otherwise, he would have great strength but would not be able to display it fully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, teach me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at Isa eagerly as if he was staring at a treasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled, "You just wanted to sleep with me just now. Now, you want me to teach you? After the teaching, will you beat me, forcefully kiss me, and sleep with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt helpless at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you please not mention this matter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Okay. Then tell me honestly, do you want to sleep with me?" joked Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said without hesitation, "No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa snorted, "Then you are definitely not a man! How could you not even want to sleep with me? You have the desire but not the courage. You are a coward! I don't teach cowards!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said helplessly, "Yes, I want to! I want to sleep with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really want to sleep with me! You damned man! You're just like other stinky men, thinking with your lower body."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glared at Isa, wishing he could pounce on her, hold her down, and spank her hard on the butt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Can you talk properly?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You're unhappy with me not wanting to sleep with you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And you're still unhappy with me wanting to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What should I do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Zoe, who was far away, couldn't help but blush as she listened to the conversation between the two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but say, "Ms. Bowin, please stop teasing Osborne. He's almost crying. Ms. Bowin, can you teach Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled proudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was just teasing him. I didn't expect him to be so naive. It's boring!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Osborne and said with a smile, "Remember, if you lose, you must agree to my condition, no matter what it is. Even if I ask you to become my lover, you must agree."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was helpless, knowing that Isa was still joking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was only harsh in her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, you can propose any conditions you want, as long as you don't let me be a test subject for your human experiments."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa said, "Of course not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I cannot tell you what I want you to do specifically yet, because you are too weak. When you get stronger, I will tell you directly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "What exactly does Isa want me to do? With my current strength, am I still too weak?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned, but he said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A person who valued promises would never regret it once he had agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa continued, "Come and learn fighting techniques from me if you are free from now on. I can feel that your physical fitness is already very strong. You're not much worse even compared to me. As long as you can learn a bit of my techniques, you will be a qualified martial artist."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Let's start now! I want to learn the Spiral Force and the Deadly Force!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa glared at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you? Spiral Force and Deadly Force are force techniques that only experienced martial artists can master. Many </span><span>Class</span><span> B+ martial artists and even Class A martial masters cannot fully master them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should start by learning the most basic force techniques."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Isa began to guide Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's physical fitness was now comparable to that of a Class B+ martial artist, </span><span>but his force-generating technique was primitive. He couldn't even exert 30% of his full strength, let alone high-end techniques such as Spiral Force and Deadly Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These high-end techniques could increase his strength tremendously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne began his painful learning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The good news was that he learned very quickly. He could easily master the techniques taught by Isa. He could achieve results in one try and reach a passing level in three. After ten tries, he could master the techniques perfectly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It shocked Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't show it. She just said coldly, "Why are you so stupid? I just learned such a simple force technique once and mastered it thoroughly. I could even apply it to other situations. You learned it more than ten times before you could satisfy me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's too slow! With your learning speed, how long will it take you to learn even 10% of my techniques?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How stupid </span><span>are</span><span> you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep going. At this rate, when will you be able to learn the Spiral Force and Deadly Force? And I have several other force techniques."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth and studied harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amid Isa's scolding, he really thought that he was stupid and could only study harder to keep up with Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time passed quickly, and it was late at night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had been practicing until he was exhausted, and then he finally lay down on the bed and fell into a dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in his dreams, he practiced various force-generating techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And even in his dreams, he could hear Isa scolding him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, it was the next day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia, Osborne's ex-wife, and Wesley would hold their wedding today.</span></p><div class="pagination">
