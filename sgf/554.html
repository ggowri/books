  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne lunged forward, his body radiating with a brilliant martial art aura as energy surged in all directions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The drone hovering above Osborne's head exploded instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing this, Osborne paused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His wounds appeared severe, but in reality, they weren't life-threatening. The dagger hadn't pierced his heart, and his body possessed remarkable healing abilities that would soon restore him to full health.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had feigned serious injury to create an opportunity to destroy the drone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With the drone taken out, his next moves would remain unseen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With this in mind, Osborne gripped the black dagger embedded in his back and violently yanked it out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Blood spurted out, but Osborne didn't flinch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His gaze remained cold and fixed on David in the distance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"David, you're done for!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Osborne charged towards David.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">David's injuries were far more severe than Osborne's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had never anticipated that Osborne, in such a dire situation, would detect his assassination attempt. Even more surprising was that Osborne had been biding his time, waiting for David to reveal himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caught off guard by Osborne's attack, David had little time to defend himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately for David, Osborne's backward kick was awkward and lacked full force; otherwise, it would have turned him into a bloody pulp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But even though David wasn't dead, he was gravely injured, lying on the ground and coughing up blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Osborne approached and held the black dagger with murderous intent, David's face turned pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite the searing pain, he tried to activate his power, hoping to blend into the darkness once more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But it was too late.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As David's body began to merge with the shadows, Osborne hurled the black dagger with immense force. It zipped through the air like a bullet, crossing several thirty feet in an instant and burying itself deep in David's throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">David's eyes widened in shock as his powers were interrupted, leaving him unable to dissolve into the shadows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne didn't hesitate&mdash;he unleashed a powerful punch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">David's desperate scream was cut short as Osborne's fist connected with his head, smashing it like a watermelon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne finally exhaled in relief, but he didn't linger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He quickly opened a dimensional space and tossed David's lifeless body inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, he stepped into a dimensional rift.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the next moment, he reappeared miles away. After several quick jumps, there wasn't another soul within dozens of miles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even then, Osborne didn't stop. He activated his earth elemental ability and burrowed into the mountainside, disappearing from sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't until a minute after he vanished that a drone finally arrived, scanning the mountain surface but failing to detect Osborne's presence within.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne activated the Satan's Eye to confirm his surroundings were safe before finally relaxing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He retrieved David's body from the dimensional space.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dark elemental power!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's eyes sparkled with excitement. The reason he had been so determined to kill David was twofold: first, because David had tried to assassinate him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Second, because of David's dark elemental power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Such power was exceedingly rare, rivaling even spatial power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now that he had encountered it, Osborne wasn't about to let the opportunity slip away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You wanted to kill me, so now you're the one who's dead. As for your dark elemental power, don't worry&mdash;I won't let it go to waste. From now on, it's mine!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Osborne used the Satan's Eye to begin absorbing the dark elemental essence from David's body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was his eighth elemental essence, and the process went smoothly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne soon felt a deep understanding of the dark element, realizing that he could now blend into the shadows just as David had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What a powerful ability!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's perfect for assassination&mdash;almost impossible to defend against! If my Satan's Eye were any weaker, or if it hadn't mutated, I never would have detected David hiding in the darkness."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was thrilled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He waved his hand, summoning flames that reduced David's body to ashes, erasing any trace that the man had ever existed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I doubt I can keep the fact that I killed David a secret, but as long as I insist it was an accident due to the intensity of his assassination attempt, no one can really fault me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At worst, I might face some minor punishment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Considering the value of this dark elemental power, a little slap on the wrist is a small price to pay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The only downside is that I can't openly use the dark element power for a while, or everyone will know I absorbed David's elemental essence."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that thought, Osborne felt a tinge of regret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he could use the dark element freely, he was confident he could stand out in the upcoming Branch Bloodline Competition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He checked the time and saw that the next emblem signal was almost due.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without hesitation, he erased any traces of his presence, retrieved an energy pistol, and emerged from the mountain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although he had killed David, eliminating a formidable enemy, the competition was far from over, and he couldn't afford to relax just yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unbeknownst to him, news of David's death had already sparked an uproar within the Augustine family.</p><div class="pagination">
