  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren's words sent a chill through everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of them, including Osborne, had never faced a Deity Overlord warrior and had only the faintest idea of just how terrifying their power could be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In truth, many still thought that no matter how formidable a Deity Overlord warrior might be, surely a few hundred of them could stand up to the challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Darren had shattered that notion like glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among everyone there, only Betty and her two sisters, who had reached the Celestial Deity level, would have a prayer of barely surviving a single strike from even the weakest Deity Overlord warrior. The rest of them? Just fodder, mere ants in the face of such overwhelming strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this was only the weakest of the Deity Overlord warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If a stronger one stepped in, even Betty and her sisters working together wouldn't stand a chance&mdash;they would be obliterated in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, even Betty and her sisters looked taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's brow furrowed deeply as a weight of understanding settled over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized he had underestimated the Deity Overlord warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having regained his full strength, he was confident he could easily overpower even the most elite Transcendent Deity warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had thought that with Betty and her sisters by his side, they might hold their own against a Deity Overlord like Fabian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps they could even force him to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, it dawned on him that he had been mistaken. If Darren was being honest, even he would struggle against a Deity Overlord warrior, likely injured within a single blow; surviving a few hits would be a significant achievement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At best, he might have a chance to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This just got complicated," Osborne muttered under his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he held no regrets about insulting Fabian, especially since Fabian's intentions to buy Betty and her sisters as breeding machines were unacceptable to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, a serious tone creeping into his voice, "Mr. Pollitt, outside the slave market, there's a Deity Overlord warrior from the Wild Bull Clan named Fabian waiting for me. The moment I step outside, he's going to come after me. Is there any way we can handle this? I've heard he's just recently become a Deity Overlord, so his skills shouldn't be too advanced."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At these words, Darren's tense expression eased considerably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Deity Overlord from the Wild Bull Clan? That's a relief! If it were a warrior from another race, we'd be in deep trouble&mdash;our current strength wouldn't stand a chance. But a Wild Bull Clan Deity Overlord gives us a fighting chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes brightened. "Mr. Pollitt, what do you mean by that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren smiled. "Back in the West Zone, I fought alongside many warriors from the Wild Bull Clan, including several Deity Overlords. So, I know their strengths and weaknesses pretty well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Wild Bull Clan excels in defense and raw power. Even among Deity Overlord warriors, their defenses are a real headache; it's incredibly tough to inflict serious damage on them. And when they charge at full force, not much can stand in their way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, they do have noticeable weaknesses&mdash;speed and agility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even a Deity Overlord from the Wild Bull Clan can seem clumsy compared to Celestial Deity warriors who specialize in speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we're going to face Fabian outside, our best bet is to use hit-and-run tactics against him. Especially in Wild Flame City, he wouldn't dare unleash widespread destruction&mdash;he'd be too concerned about damaging the surrounding buildings. He'll likely try to close in on us instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren paused, his brow furrowing as he scanned the group, his expression turning serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fabian is still a Deity Overlord. No matter how slow he might be, I doubt any of us can match his speed, let alone outmaneuver him. It's a tough situation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words hung heavily in the air, and everyone's faces reflected their concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty exchanged glances with her sisters, her expression equally grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't help but sigh. After all, none of the three excelled in speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they had, they wouldn't have ended up captured and put on display at the slave market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the Wild Bull Clan's slower pace, Fabian's status as a Deity Overlord meant his speed would still outstrip theirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do we do now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty and her sisters frowned deeply, brainstorming solutions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they couldn't neutralize the threat posed by Fabian, their newly formed Spark of Blaze wouldn't even be able to leave the slave market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could be snuffed out before they even got started!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And they couldn't hide in the slave market forever; it closed at midnight, leaving them just a few hours to figure something out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the clock struck twelve, they'd have to face Fabian head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the plan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was deep in thought, including Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is speed really Fabian's weak point? Maybe we can work with that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He turned to Tiana, who was standing a short distance away. "Tiana, I need a private room!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
