  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, "The Nirvana Flame of the Ember Phoenix Clan? Can my Dark Phoenix Flame work? The Dark Phoenix is the strongest existence in the Ember Phoenix Clan."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Primordial glanced at Osborne. "Are you dreaming? Dark Phoenix Flame, Radiant Phoenix Flame, or any other Phoenix Flame are just different forms of the Phoenix Flame. Although they vary in strength, they are all on the same level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And the Nirvana Flame is a Phoenix Flame of another level. Simply put, flames can be divided into at least six levels: Mortal Flame, Sacred Flame, Astral Flame, Principle Flame, Undying Flame, and Creation Flame. The Nirvana Flame belongs to the fifth level, the Undying Flame.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And your Dark Phoenix Flame is only at the second level, a slightly stronger Sacred Flame. It's a bit stronger than a Mortal Flame, but it's still incredibly far from becoming a Principle Flame.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If your cultivation level breaks through and reaches Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, your Dark Phoenix Flame will evolve into an Astral Flame. If you continue to enhance your strength, master the power of Flame Principle, and integrate it into your Dark Phoenix Flame, it will become a Principle Flame.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, there is still a vast gap between a Principle Flame and the Nirvana Flame. Mastering the Nirvana Flame is equivalent to possessing the power of immortality. Anyone in the Ember Phoenix Clan can be reborn, resurrected, and even become stronger within the Nirvana Flame.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, even in the central region of the cosmos, warriors of the Ember Phoenix Clan who can master the Nirvana Flame are considered supreme warriors."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Primordial's words, Osborne and Adriana were stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had never heard of these things and didn't know that flames could be divided into so many levels.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mortal Flame? Sacred Flame? Astral Flame? Principle Flame? Undying Flame? Creation Flame?" Osborne couldn't help but ask, "Primordial, since flames can be divided into so many levels, do other powers have similar distinctions? Like thunder, light, darkness, and wind?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial looked at Osborne with approval. "Not bad. You actually know how to draw inferences. You're finally starting to think."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes, thinking, "If it weren't for you, this little sapling, stealing the memories of the other eight World Tree offshoots, you might not know more than me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne ignored the smug Primordial and started asking questions seriously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial explained, "Actually, the six levels I just mentioned can be called Mortal Level, Sacred Level, Astral Level, Principle Level, Undying Level, and Creation Level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"These six levels can almost be used to distinguish the rank of any power, any creature, and any treasure in the cosmos, also known as the Six Cosmos Levels."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let me use you as an example. You started as an ordinary human on Blue Planet, the lowest and most common low-tier creature in the cosmos, which is a being at the Mortal Level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, through cultivation, you can elevate your life level. When your cultivation level progresses from Class F to Class E, Class D, Class C, Class B, Class A, Class S, and finally reaches Class SSS, your life level undergoes its first enhancement."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You reached Junior Deity and transformed from a being at the Mortal Level to one at the Sacred Level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Afterward, as you advanced from Junior Deity to Intermediate Deity, Superior Deity, and reached Supernal Deity King Level, even to your current Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, you have remained at the Sacred Level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But next, if you can reach Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, your life level will elevate once again, rising from Sacred Level to Astral Level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Beings at the Astral Level can adapt to most harsh environments in the cosmos. Traversing vast voids is something only beings at the Astral Level can achieve."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Beings at the Astral Level are the backbone of the cosmos and the most numerous. Of course, since we are at the edge of the cosmos, we rarely encounter beings at the Astral Level. When you venture deeper into the cosmos, you'll realize that beings at the Astral Level are the mainstream."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you have enough talent and continue to grow stronger, one day you will uncover the true secrets of the cosmos and the Cosmos Principle, mastering its power. By then, your life level will rise once again, reaching the Principle Level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Beings at the Principle Level wield the power of the Cosmos Principle. Such existence is beyond what you can imagine now. Throughout the cosmos, beings at the Principle Level are incredibly formidable."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But Principle Level is not the peak. Above Principle Level is the Undying Level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Beings at the Undying Level are the true Masters of the cosmos, the ones who can truly rule the cosmos, like Empress Kira."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stronger than beings at the Undying Level are those at the Creation Level. However, beings at the Creation Level only exist in legends, and no one has ever truly seen them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, Primordial shrugged.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then he continued, "In short, you are merely beings at the second level, Sacred Level, while the Nirvana Flame, or Undying Flame, capable of destroying the Soulbane Parasite, is at the fifth level. Forget about mastering or possessing it; you'd be doomed just by getting close."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In short, any creature, power, or treasure can be classified into the six levels I just mentioned. For example, artifacts and herbs can be divided into Mortal Level, Sacred Level, Astral Level, Principle Level, Undying Level, and Creation Level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing Primordial's words, Osborne and Adriana were completely stunned. This was simply too shocking for them. With their current strength and cultivation level, they were undoubtedly supreme warriors on the Racial Convergence Planet. They could even become rulers of some small Stellar Regions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But according to Primordial's explanation, they were merely beings at the second level, the Sacred Level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Above the Sacred Level, there are Astral Level, Principle Level, Undying Level, and Creation Level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, in the cosmos, they hadn't even reached the mid-tier level and were merely at a lower rank.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Osborne and Adriana's worldview somewhat collapse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It took a long time before the two of them regained their composure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shifted the topic to the main issue. Looking at May, he frowned and said, "Primordial, is the Undying Flame of the Ember Phoenix Clan the only way to eliminate the Soulbane Parasite parasitizing May's Soul Current Ocean?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said calmly, "I really don't have any better solutions. Do you know why the Bug Clan was the first to dominate the cosmos? Do you know why Empress Kira became the cosmos's first Master?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned, thinking, "Why is Primordial asking this?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He frowned and said, "That's obviously because Empress Kira and the Bug Clan are the strongest."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Primordial shook his head. "That's only part of the reason. Actually, there's another reason."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Primordial looked at May.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne trembled and said in surprise, "Could this be related to the Soulbane Parasite?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
