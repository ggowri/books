  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda gasped, her eyes wide as she processed the sight of Osborne effortlessly taking down Nell, Killian, and Harley&mdash;all Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stood frozen, completely dumbstruck, forgetting her own injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In disbelief, Alfreda rubbed her eyes, then smacked her forehead, as if trying to wake from a dream </span><span>that had </span><span>gone wrong. "Surely this can't be real..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was all too real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mastery over space elemental essence had reached the pinnacle of Level Nine, and with the Bloodwrought Bow amplifying his power, those spatial arrows were utterly terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the seasoned Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings couldn't stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now the trio lay dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reflecting on the past, Alfreda recalled how they had all wanted to join her exploration team. Even back then, she had agreed to their request. They had scoffed at Osborne's cultivation level, dismissing him as a liability, insisting she kick him off the team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Little did they know then that their mockery would lead them to their demise at his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they had realized, perhaps they would have reconsidered their stance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a bitter thought, but ultimately, there was no turning back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regret was a luxury that didn't exist for them now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The silence was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The astonishment wasn't limited to Alfreda; Prince Desmond and Princess Monica, standing not far off, were equally thrown into shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desmond, in particular, felt his world tilting beneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Images flashed in his mind of their first encounter&mdash;when Osborne had just arrived in Elf City. Back then, he hadn't known the rules of their realm. Desmond remembered how he had glared at Osborne for sneaking a glance, on the verge of ordering a punishment against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it hadn't been for Princess Joanna stepping in to defend Osborne, he would have struck first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the time, Desmond had thought it was pure luck that saved Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, as he witnessed Osborne effortlessly take down Pierce, Nell, Killian, and Harley, the reality hit him like a punch to the gut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized it wasn't Osborne who was lucky; it was he who had been saved by Joanna's intervention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had he dared to challenge Osborne back then, it would have been a grave mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desmond's eyes widened with sheer terror as he regarded Osborne; even surrounded by his fifty elite warriors from the Fire Elf Clan's Royal Family, he felt no semblance of security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only fear consumed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run! Get out of here! Now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desmond's voice rang out in panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each fall of his composure, he discarded any desire to reclaim the twenty-eight Element Gold Crystals. The only thing on his mind was escaping&mdash;getting as far away from Osborne and Alfreda as he could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he wanted was to stay alive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared with life, what were the twenty-eight Element Gold Crystals?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desmond believed that as long as he could flee back to Elf City, he had plenty of ways to deal with Osborne and Alfreda!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just run for your lives!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his frantic flight, he didn't even spare a thought for Monica; all that mattered was survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's gaze hardened as he observed Desmond's desperate attempts to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph, think you can escape?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not going anywhere! You'll all die here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drawing back the Bloodwrought Bow once more, he conjured three more spatial arrows, ready to unleash their fury. As he released the arrows, they soared through the air with deadly precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Someone save me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desmond felt the creeping dread settle in as the arrows sped toward him, and panic took hold of him utterly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Protect the prince!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guardians of the Fire Elf Clan's Royal Family, despite their own fear, rushed forward without a second thought as they saw Desmond in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They threw themselves in front of him, determined to shield him from Osborne's deadly arrows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, </span><span>the </span><span>three guards were obliterated, their bodies exploding into nothingness, consumed by the collapsing space around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spatial arrows continued on, striking Desmond's shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though his Elf Armour absorbed some of the impact, the force still sent him crashing to the ground, blood gushing from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Protect Prince Desmond!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quick, shield the prince!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other guards, driven by a lifetime of training to protect the Royal Family, went into a frenzy. Some surrounded Desmond, while others, faces twisted with rage, charged at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them shouted, "We'll hold him off!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get Desmond and Princess Monica out of here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Move it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over twenty warriors from the Fire Elf Clan's Royal Family charged toward Osborne, ready to sacrifice themselves for the prince and princess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were fearless, willing to buy time for their royal family to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne merely snorted, unimpressed. "Think you can tie me up and let him slip away? You're dreaming!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They won't make it out alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes glinted with cold malice. Regardless of any personal grievances with Desmond, Osborne had no intention of letting him leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he and Alfreda had already taken down many from the Fire Elf Clan's Royal Family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they were allowed to leave alive and return to the Elf City, they would surely spread the news of what had happened in Umbra Earth. By then, the fury of the Fire Elf Clan's Royal Family would be no laughing matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne, as confident as he was, didn't think he could handle such a situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when that time came, Alfreda would also be in big trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to eradicate every last one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they couldn't return, no one would know that Desmond and Monica had fallen at his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them!" Osborne's resolve hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until now, he had been testing the waters, gauging his true strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, it was time to unleash everything he had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolute forbidden zone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a resonant hum, a massive, Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity materialized behind him, exploding into a faint crimson Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within this Realm, everyone's cultivation level was rapidly suppressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings found their powers diminished to Ascension Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And for those of the same level as Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only smirk. "I'm invincible; you're all at my mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And thus, the slaughter began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards, with cultivation levels of Ascension Four and Five, were already outmatched, but now, under the suppression, they felt as weak as infants in Osborne's presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his hand, he summoned a storm of lightning, enveloping the twenty or so warriors before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, they were reduced to charred remains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne then flashed forward, blocking the panicked escape route of Desmond and Monica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both siblings wore expressions of sheer terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! Don't kill me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm a prince of the Fire Elf Clan! You can't do this! If you harm me, our father and mother will hunt you down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, I beg you... don't kill me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desmond's face was a mask of desperation, but Osborne merely scoffed at his pleas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no time for words, no patience for bargaining. He summoned the power of the storm without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deafening roar, the sky darkened as lightning crackled, ready to strike down upon them.</span></p><div class="pagination">
