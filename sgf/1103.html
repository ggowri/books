  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We are not the Aberrants, those laughable Class S clones!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We are true Class S warriors!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reginald's face was full of disdain, not even bothering to take Osborne seriously, nor the members of the Blood Demon or the forces of the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kept his cold gaze fixed on Osborne, saying, "I'm quite curious, why do you want to capture me alive? Do we have some kind of grudge?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a cold snort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the members of the League of Divine Descent didn't seem in a rush to attack, Osborne was also in no hurry to engage. He decided to use this moment to find out if Reginald was indeed responsible for his parents' disappearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne asked, "Reginald, twenty-five years ago, did you happen to visit Rosmandi? Specifically, did you secretly go to Skyefall in Rosmandi?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reginald raised an eyebrow at the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean by that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne narrowed his eyes. "So, it seems you did go to Skyefall in Rosmandi twenty-five years ago, didn't you? As far as I know, the Hastings family, your family, is a major power in Jaris, which is hundreds of miles away from Rosmandi!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For someone of your status, why would you sneak off to such a remote place?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reginald snorted coldly, "Who do you think you are to question me? I, Reginald, go wherever I want, and no one can control that! Do you really think I need to inform you of my whereabouts?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, twenty-five years ago is a long time, and I've already forgotten all about that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued with a chilly expression, "I have no time for your nonsense. Today marks the end of the Augustine family! Every last one of you will die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attack! Kill them all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reginald gave the order to attack without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His refusal to answer directly only convinced Osborne that Reginald's visit to Rosmandi twenty-five years ago held some secret, deepening Osborne's suspicions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne responded coldly, "Since you refuse to talk, I'll just have to capture you alive and force the answers out of you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne also gave the command to engage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle exploded into chaos once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On one side stood the 300-plus Class S warriors of the League of Divine Descent, while on the other side were less than ten Class S warriors alongside more than 4,000 Class AAA Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take out these weaklings first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reginald ordered, and immediately, the 300-plus warriors directed their attacks at the Blood Demon members, unleashing their full power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon members' expressions shifted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they did not retreat; there was no fear in their eyes. Years of rigorous training had ingrained a battle instinct in them, and they responded instantly, moving as one unit, like a single entity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with the onslaught of over 300 Class S warriors, they knew that only by standing together, sharing the burden, and supporting each other could they stand a chance of survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they were only Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The coordinated assault of more than 300 Class S warriors struck the Blood Demon members. Such a devastating attack would obliterate not just Class AAA fighters but even Class S warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon members united their strength, creating a defensive network that distributed the force of the attack among them, allowing each to bear only a fraction of the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even so, they couldn't hold on for long!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearly all the Blood Demon members were forced to stagger back from the powerful strikes. Even though they had managed to diffuse some of the energy, the sheer force left them pale and bleeding, clearly injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their formation became disordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Reginald sneered with disdain, "Did you really think you could pit over 4,000 Class AAA warriors against our 300 Class S fighters? Nice try! But as I said, we are not the Aberrants' laughable clones. We are true Class S warriors!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They can't stop us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Crush them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The League of Divine Descent's 300 Class S warriors, led by Reginald, launched another wave of ferocious attacks at the Blood Demon members. Even though the Blood Demon team fought as one, they could not withstand the relentless assault and were pushed back again, sustaining severe injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, they all carried Crystals of Life, which allowed them to recover from their injuries quickly. As long as they weren't killed outright, they could regenerate rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the continuous barrage of attacks left the Blood Demon members in worse and worse shape, with their injuries piling up faster than the Crystals of Life could heal them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon members had no opportunity to counterattack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear to everyone that, unless something changed, the Blood Demon members could only endure a few more rounds of this onslaught before they would collapse entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this critical moment, Wesson, Greyson, Bryce, and the others all turned pale with alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is bad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They prepared to rush forward to help, intending to assist the Blood Demon members in holding the line. They knew that if the Blood Demon formation broke under the League of Divine Descent's attack, none of them would survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before they could move, Osborne stopped them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said coldly, "Do not intervene! Even though you are Class S, you have never trained alongside the Blood Demon members. Trying to assist them without coordination would do more harm than good, disrupting their defense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's faces grew even more worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What should we do then? If this continues, they won't hold out! If their formation breaks, we're all finished!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
