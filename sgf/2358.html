  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was a bit scared, completely unprepared for the Warfare Shield's attack to be so powerful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he hadn't broken the Warfare Shield first, and if this were a real battle instead of just a test from the Warfare Ancient Tree, he might have been seriously injured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If the Warfare Shield had chosen to attack instead of defend from the start, Osborne might not even have had the chance to launch an attack before being completely defeated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, the power of the Warfare Shield far exceeded Osborne's expectations.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very happy at this moment because he had passed the test of the Warfare Ancient Tree. From now on, the four Sacred Artifacts, including the Warfare Shield, would all belong to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You have passed the test." At this moment, the deep voice of the Warfare Ancient Tree sounded. "According to my agreement with the World Tree offshoot, if you passed my test, I would have to follow you. If you failed, you would have to give me the Ascending Sacred Sanctum. Now, you have won. I will follow you from now on."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Osborne exited the virtual space. Immediately, the massive Warfare Ancient Tree began to shake violently, emitting a loud roar. It quickly shrank and then entered Osborne's body, disappearing without a trace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne felt a massive tree appear in his Soul Current Ocean, and that was the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Warfare Ancient Tree, like the Primordial, had entered and taken root in his Soul Current Ocean. Osborne could even feel the Warfare Ancient Tree wildly absorbing his Sacred Power as nourishment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it were someone else, their Sacred Power would probably be drained quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even an ordinary warrior at the Empyrean Sacredness level couldn't withstand the Warfare Ancient Tree's frantic absorption of Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne possessed the Chaotic Spiritual Root.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His Sacred Power would be replenished immediately after being absorbed by the Warfare Ancient Tree. So, he wasn't worried about the consumption at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But such a situation still left Osborne utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What&rsquo;s going on?" Osborne frowned deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "What did the Warfare Ancient Tree mean by those words just now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Warfare Ancient Tree made an agreement with Primordial: if I win, the Warfare Ancient Tree will follow me from now on. If I lose, I have to give the Ascending Sacred Sanctum to the Warfare Ancient Tree. What does this mean?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Isn't this trial only about those four Sacred Artifacts?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne suddenly turned his head, unhappily looking at Primordial. "Primordial, don't you owe me an explanation? What agreement did you make with the Warfare Ancient Tree? You actually used the Ascending Sacred Sanctum as a wager. Why didn't you tell me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Primordial smiled and said, "The reason I didn't tell you beforehand was that I was afraid you'd get nervous and it would affect your performance. Besides, the result is good. In the end, you won. This shows I have confidence in you; I believed you could win."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, you've gained the greatest benefit. Before, you could only get the four Sacred Artifacts. But now, you can take the Warfare Ancient Tree. It will be my neighbor in your Soul Current Ocean. It will be of great help to you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying this, Primordial looked a bit smug.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave it a glare, feeling somewhat helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne had known that Primordial would bet the Ascending Sacred Sanctum against the Warfare Ancient Tree, he would never have agreed. Because the Ascending Sacred Sanctum is his most important asset, he cannot afford to lose it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Primordial hid the truth from Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, the ending was good. Osborne won, gaining not only the four Sacred Artifacts on the Warfare Ancient Tree, the hundreds of quasi-Sacredness Level Leaf Warships, but also the Warfare Ancient Tree itself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Osborne doesn't yet know how the Warfare Ancient Tree will help him, the fact that it can produce Sacred Artifacts already makes it priceless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Forget it. Just don't pull something like this again next time. At the very least, let me know in advance." Osborne felt helpless toward Primordial and could only let it go.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Quickly take out my Sacred Artifact-level spear for me," said Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What should I do?" Osborne asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said, "Just communicate directly with the Warfare Ancient Tree. It's rooted in your Soul Current Ocean, absorbing your Sacred Power to grow, so it's somewhat fused with you. You can easily communicate with it. However, the Warfare Ancient Tree isn't very intelligent, not as smart as I am. You can give it simple commands directly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing this, Osborne was even more surprised and thought, "Has the Warfare Ancient Tree somewhat fused with me? Can I directly give it simple commands?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne tried it and indeed could communicate with the Warfare Ancient Tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, a spear appeared in his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Primordial quickly snatched it. "Great! I have a Sacred Artifact too."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said happily, "From now on, I'll call you World Spear. Although you're not strong enough yet, I tricked the Warfare Ancient Tree over here. With Osborne's endless Sacred Power nurturing the Warfare Ancient Tree, it will grow stronger and stronger, and you'll also be nurtured to become more powerful."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne looked at Primordial in surprise. "What does this mean?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial glanced at Osborne and calmly said, "You should thank me. Do you know why I insisted on tricking the Warfare Ancient Tree over here? Because as long as the Warfare Ancient Tree is with you, we can place the Sacred Artifact on it, and it will continuously enhance the power of the Sacred Artifact for us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Right now, my World Spear can only be considered a mid-grade Sacred Artifact. Since it grew from the Warfare Ancient Tree, it's slightly stronger than an ordinary mid-grade Sacred Artifact, but not by much. However, as long as we keep it on the Warfare Ancient Tree, it will eventually become a top-grade Sacred Artifact, an Ultimate Sacred Artifact, a supreme Sacred Artifact, and might even one day surpass the level of a Sacred Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing Primordial, Osborne was very surprised and thought, "The Warfare Ancient Tree can actually continue nurturing these Sacred Artifacts to further enhance their grade?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is nothing," Primordial sneered. "The Warfare Ancient Tree can not only nurture the Sacred Artifacts it grows itself but also other Sacred Artifacts, like your Bloodwrought Bow. You can communicate with the Warfare Ancient Tree and have it help nurture and enhance your Bloodwrought Bow. You can even have the Warfare Ancient Tree grant your Bloodwrought Bow entirely new abilities and effects according to your wishes."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By the way, even your Ascending Sacred Sanctum can be placed on the Warfare Ancient Tree for nurturing. Given enough time, the Ascending Sacred Sanctum could even be completely restored by the Warfare Ancient Tree, regaining all its power as a supreme Sacred Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was now stunned, his mouth wide open.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne's breathing became rapid. If what Primordial said was true, the value of the Warfare Ancient Tree was immense. Osborne only needed to provide some Sacred Power to the Warfare Ancient Tree to gain so many benefits. This was absolutely worth it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I can have the Warfare Ancient Tree help nurture the Bloodwrought Bow, upgrade it, and add new abilities."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I can also have the Warfare Ancient Tree help repair the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When I need to use them, I'll take them out to face the enemy. During normal times, I'll leave them on the Warfare Ancient Tree for continuous upgrades.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is awesome. The Warfare Ancient Tree is simply a treasure."</span></p><div class="pagination">
