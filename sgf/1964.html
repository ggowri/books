  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disappearance of the ascension Stairway marked Osborne's successful breakthrough. He had finally become a true Ascension One Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, instead of joy, he felt a heavy weight pressing down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at the spot where the white tiger had vanished, his brow furrowing with concern. The tiger's final words echoed in his mind, leaving him uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, "Anomaly?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They want to kill me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What exactly is this white tiger?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was at a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Primordial!" he called out, hoping Primordial might shed some light on the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you completed your breakthrough? Congratulations! You're now an Ascension One Supernal Deity King! You've truly reached the pinnacle of this world's hierarchy!" Primordial's voice rang out, filled with enthusiasm. "But with your strength, passing the test should have been a walk in the park. I'm curious why it took you so long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback. "You didn't know what just happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial replied, "Not a clue!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There was a strange energy that sealed off my senses the moment the Ascension Stairway appeared! I couldn't perceive anything happening outside!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's surprise deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial sounded intrigued. "Could it be that something unexpected happened during your breakthrough?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, quickly recounting the events of his trial to Primordial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long silence, Primordial finally spoke, "Osborne, I can't believe they've set their sights on you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They see you as an anomaly? You're in serious trouble!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I should have anticipated this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With your current level and the power you displayed, it was only a matter of time before they recognized you as a threat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's curiosity piqued. "Primordial, what's going on? Who are they? How can they sense my strength? And why do they consider me an anomaly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's tone was grave, underscoring the seriousness of the situation. "I don't have all the answers. My memories are limited to what I absorbed at birth from the other eight World Tree offshoots, so it's not complete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What I do know is that they are the true rulers of this world. They sit high above, establishing their own rules in the name of the Creator Deity. Everyone must adhere to their regulations, or they'll face brutal suppression and retaliation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Ascension Stairway is one of their rules! They created it to keep most beings from ever surpassing the Deity King Level, preventing them from reaching higher realms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Resources in this world are finite!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The more beings that exceed the Deity King level, the more these elite figures at the top must share resources with others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's why they've twisted the rules, ensuring that anyone who reaches the highest Deity King Level must face the trials of the Ascension Stairway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are four trials in total, and only those who pass all four will be deemed worthy to share in the world's resources and stand at the apex of the pyramid, looking down upon the countless beings below, like ants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is an organization!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Every member comes from those powerful races! For instance, the Sacred Dragon Clan, the Sacred Tiger Clan, the Angel Clan, and so on. The most formidable warriors from these elite races have formed this organization, which has the power to set rules for the entire world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They call themselves the 'Order of the Celestial Way'!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know this because at least one World Tree offshoot is part of this organization, and I managed to steal some of its memories!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's words left Osborne stunned, his eyes wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Order of the Celestial Way?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They dictate the rules of the world?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They sit high above, looking down at countless beings like ants?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Ascension Stairway is one of their rules?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Four trials? So when I break through to Ascension Four Supernal Deity King, I'll have to face the second trial of the Ascension Stairway?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And those beings up there will project their power to try to kill me again? That white tiger was a warrior from the Sacred Tiger Clan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial nodded. "Exactly! They clearly discovered your Infinite Sacred Body through the Ascension Stairway!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Typically, only beings from super races possess such a body, and you're just a human!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's why the Order of the Celestial Way sees you as an anomaly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're keen on eradicating anomalies like you before you can grow strong enough to challenge the rules they've set.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With your current strength, you can't possibly break their rules! So, during your breakthroughs to Ascension Four, Ascension Seven, and Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King, you'll have to endure the trials of the Ascension Stairway!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At that point, they'll project even greater power to eliminate you! You're in serious trouble. Their level is far beyond yours, even higher than that of Lord Malevolence or Creation Herald. Even if they can only project a fraction of their power through the Ascension Stairway, it's still enough to wipe you out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, "What can I do about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial replied, "What can you do? You have to get stronger! As long as you become powerful enough, they won't be able to kill you! After all, they have to abide by the rules they set for the world!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They project their power through the Ascension Stairway, which has its limits! If your strength exceeds what the Ascension Stairway can handle, they'll just have to watch as you grow stronger without being able to do anything about it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, that's easier said than done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne let out a sigh of relief. "I know what I need to do! I still have plenty of time before I break through to Ascension Four. I'll keep pushing my limits! Let them come, this Order of the Celestial Way. They think they can kill me? Not a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they see me as an anomaly, fearing that I'll disrupt their precious rules and pull them down from their lofty heights... then I'll make it my mission to do just that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With renewed confidence, Osborne wore a proud smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial watched him, opening its mouth as if wanting to say something, but ultimately held back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's the spirit! I support your plan to topple the Order of the Celestial Way. When the time comes, we'll establish new rules and order for this world!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, "I take it you want me to help you take down that World Tree offshoot in the Order of the Celestial Way?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just a little bit..." Primordial admitted sheepishly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, choosing not to dwell on Primordial's request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Order of the Celestial Way felt like a distant concern for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What mattered most was protecting the Human Community of Celestara and dealing with Lord Malevolence!</span></p><div class="pagination">
