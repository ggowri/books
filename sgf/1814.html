  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, Zoe swung her Supreme Malevolence Sword down hard, but to her shock, the blade lodged against Hubery's neck, failing to sever it completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a weapon on par with an Ultimate Divine Artifact, so Hubery's strength was no trivial matter&mdash;his Divine Body was incredibly resilient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even standing still, he would be difficult for most early-stage Deity Kings to kill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Celestara, he was one of the elites at the top of the power pyramid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately for him, he had crossed paths with Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One more try, then," Zoe thought, lifting her sword again, intent on finally ending Hubery's life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery, already on the brink, cried out in agony. He could still feel his life slipping away, and as Zoe's expression remained cool and unyielding, panic flooded his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no choice but to plead, "Wait! Don't kill me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can tell you a secret&mdash;a secret that could mean life or death for the Human Community! Just don't kill me, and I'll share everything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's sword hesitated mid-air as she glanced at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow. "A secret concerning the survival of the Human Community?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Zoe pause, Hubery breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! Just spare my life, and I promise to reveal information that only a few high-ranking members of the Paramount Supreme Clan know. You'll want to hear it! So please, don't kill me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cynical smile appeared on Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I am certainly intrigued..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery, sensing a glimmer of hope, relaxed momentarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the relief was short-lived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said calmly, "I have my ways of finding out your secret. Right now, it's time for you to embrace your fate. You harmed my sister and my friends, believing you could escape unscathed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How na&iuml;ve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zoe, no need to hold back&mdash;finish him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Osborne's command, Zoe's eyes lit up with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nodded sharply and raised her Supreme Malevolence Sword with renewed vigor. "You're done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift slash, the sword descended once more, leaving Hubery's expression frozen in shock, confusion, and pure terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized too late that nothing could save him as the sword struck his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blade sliced through, sending Hubery's head flying and a torrent of blood spewing forth, his life force rapidly dissipating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... All of you... will regret this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The esteemed Lord Malevolence... he... he won't forgive you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be waiting for you in hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's immense vitality allowed him to utter these threats even after his head was separated from his body before he finally fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe felt a surge of satisfaction, the weight in her chest lifting, but her relief quickly turned to concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what about the secret he mentioned?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a calm smile, Osborne reassured her, "Don't worry! I have my own methods."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he activated Satan's Eye, delving into Hubery's memories and retrieving the crucial information, sealing it within the depths of his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then quickly scanned his findings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using Satan's Eye to seal away the memories of fallen enemies was a power Osborne had gained after Satan's Eye broke through to Level Six. However, he hadn't relied on it in quite some time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had learned that sealing too many memories within his mind could lead to confusion and chaos in his own recollections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless absolutely necessary, Osborne preferred to avoid the hassle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Hubery's claim of knowing a secret that could determine the fate of the Human Community piqued Osborne's curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was enough to draw him back into his old habits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a peak Deity King, Hubery had spent over a thousand years cultivating his power, resulting in a vast and intricate memory. Osborne delved into Hubery's mind, sifting through the layers of memories, searching for anything useful and, of course, the monumental secret that had been hinted at.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, he was also controlling his Spatial Clones to clean up the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over five hundred Deity Kings from various races had perished here, many of whom were high-ranking officials or even leaders of their respective factions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their deaths would undoubtedly send shockwaves throughout Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne needed to keep his involvement a secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If word got out that he was responsible, his power would be exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, he had to ensure the battlefield was thoroughly cleared and then create some clever disguises.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had a plan in mind. By leaving behind a significant amount of Ultimate Soul Resonance Fluid, he could attract the Deathborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon enough, these creatures would arrive in droves, erasing all traces of the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne urged, glancing at his comrades, "Let's get out of here! With so many powerful beings dead, it won't be long before their factions send people to investigate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our work in the East Zone is done; now it's time to head to the West Zone!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
