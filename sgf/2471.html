  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Osborne is the champion of the zone duel!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it were just an ordinary champion, it wouldn't attract so much attention. After all, many spectators are Empyrean Sacredness warriors, including quite a few at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection and even Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection levels.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In their eyes, the zone duel is merely a competition for the younger generation below Empyrean Sacredness. Even winning the championship proves nothing; to reach their level, one must endure many trials and even rely on some luck.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, the zone duel champion is not taken seriously by them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the Glorious Divine Kingdom has ten regions, and the zone duel is held every ten years, so every decade, ten zone duel champions emerge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That's nothing special.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, everyone watching in Crescentia, regardless of their realm, couldn't help but look at Osborne with incredibly complex expressions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was shock, envy, jealousy, as well as greed and killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's because Osborne, the champion of this zone duel, is too extraordinary. In the projection above their heads, the leaderboard still hangs high.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's name is prominently displayed at the top.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But what truly shocked them, even stirred their greed, was Osborne's gains.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>3.8 million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is enough to exchange for four Supreme Sacred Artifacts in the Glorious Divine Kingdom's treasury!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even a First-rate Power might not possess a Supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet Osborne, a junior below Empyrean Sacredness, actually possesses wealth enough to buy four Supreme Sacred Artifacts!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Who wouldn't feel greedy?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, opportunity made the thief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In their eyes, Osborne now seems like a toddler who just learned to walk, holding a huge gold brick in his arms...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Any normal person who sees it would want to snatch it!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, everyone is now staring at Osborne. Osborne clearly felt their greed, malice, and even intense killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were simply too many people present, and Osborne couldn't even tell where all this malice was coming from.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Or...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone harbored malice toward him, all wanting to snatch his Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Osborne frown deeply.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is bad! Their greed and malice are even stronger than I imagined! I'm afraid as soon as I leave here, someone will follow me, find a chance to take me out, and steal my Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath to calm himself down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, Clara and Leroy looked extremely pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They also felt the malice, the countless greedy gazes now fixed on them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Kingdom Duel Scorepoints they had, though not as much as Osborne's, were still enough to make anyone envious, naturally attracting greedy gazes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their endurance wasn't as strong as Osborne's, and their bodies were trembling slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne reached out and held their hands. Feeling the warmth from his palms, they finally felt a bit better.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, we're in big trouble!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy's voice was full of worry as she used Telepathy, "Just now, my master used Telepathy to tell me that many people are eyeing the Kingdom Duel Scorepoints on me. She said her strength isn't enough to protect me, and Azure Haven Academy can't protect me either."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara also used Telepathy, "It's pretty much the same on my side! My master can't protect me, and Fantasia Isle can't either! My master told me to figure it out myself..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The best solution is to immediately go to Phantom Commerce Guild and exchange the Kingdom Duel Scorepoints for Sacred Crystals or other treasures, then hand them over to different Sect elders for safekeeping!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They said this is the only way to minimize losses! Even if some are stolen, there will definitely be some left!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but feel surprised upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go to Phantom Commerce Guild, exchange the Kingdom Duel Scorepoints for Sacred Crystals or other treasures? Hand them over to different Sect elders for safekeeping?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is indeed a solution..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, using Kingdom Duel Scorepoints to exchange for Sacred Crystals or treasures at Phantom Commerce Guild is a bit of a loss! Exchanging treasures at the Glorious Divine Kingdom's treasury is the most worthwhile!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, if you hand over the exchanged items to others in the Sect, are you sure you can get them back? When they tell you it was robbed on the way... what can you do?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara, upon hearing this, immediately bit her lip tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then what should I do?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought for a moment and said, "If you trust me, then don't exchange! Or, you can directly transfer your Kingdom Duel Scorepoints to me... this way, with no Kingdom Duel Scorepoints on you, no one will target you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll escape alone and find a place to hide, which will be safer! When the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel comes, I'll return the Kingdom Duel Scorepoints to you..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Osborne finished speaking, their eyes immediately lit up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this okay? Wouldn't this make you even more dangerous? More people will come after you..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile. "Does it make a difference? Even if you don't transfer your Kingdom Duel Scorepoints to me, my 38 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints are enough to tempt anyone. There won't be fewer people hunting me down."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy exchanged a glance upon hearing this, seemingly hesitant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn&rsquo;t insist and said, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re unwilling, don&rsquo;t trust me, or fear that I won&rsquo;t return your Kingdom Duel Scorepoints in the future! Or, you&rsquo;re worried I might get killed, and your Kingdom Duel Scorepoints would be taken... Then you can handle it yourselves, it&rsquo;s fine! You can follow your Sect elders&rsquo; advice, or leave with me! I&rsquo;ll do my best to protect you&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara quickly said, "Osborne, it's not that we're unwilling or don't trust you! We're just worried that letting you take all the risks alone would be too dangerous for you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's right, we all trust you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy also said, "Besides, the reason we got so many Kingdom Duel Scorepoints is all thanks to you! These Kingdom Duel Scorepoints are practically a gift from you to us..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if you really took them and didn't return them to us, we wouldn't have any complaints! Our lives were saved by you..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Leroy said, "Osborne, I'll transfer the Kingdom Duel Scorepoints to you! Because I know, if you take us along to escape, it would be like carrying two burdens... We don't want to hold you back!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara also nodded. "I agree! With Leroy's and my abilities and means, we really can't handle such a crisis. Following you would only hold you back, so it's better to let you face it alone!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, you must stay alive!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you die... I, Clara, swear that no matter who killed you, I will definitely avenge you by killing them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Me too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They firmly finished speaking and suddenly, in front of billions of viewers, took out their Kingdom Duel Badges.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Clara and Leroy voluntarily transferred all the Kingdom Duel Scorepoints from their Kingdom Duel Badges to Osborne's Badge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the Kingdom Duel Scorepoints on Osborne's Kingdom Duel Badge increased from over 38 billion to over 46 billion...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation instantly left everyone stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, exclamations erupted.</span></p><div class="pagination">
