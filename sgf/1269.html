  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia was nearly panicking. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regret and guilt were etched across her face; she couldn't shake the feeling that if she hadn't suggested the delay tactic, they wouldn't have sent only fifty fighters against Joseph. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They should have launched a full-scale assault together. With over a hundred of them fighting at full strength, they could have easily defeated Joseph. But that wasn't how it played out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's plan, which aimed to keep their full strength hidden and buy time, had backfired. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had all misjudged the impact their Level Three Divine Bodies would have on Joseph. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he escaped, Joseph returned with reinforcements, leaving them no chance to buy more time. Now, facing five Superior Deities, even their combined efforts seemed futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the relentless assault from Joseph and his companions, cracks began to form in the defenses of the Augustine family. One by one, their Divine Bodies faltered, their Ethereal Glow dimming rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's laughter echoed through the chaos. "Hahaha! A mere hundred and twenty Junior Deities think you can stand against us? You're delusional! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The fact that you've lasted this long is impressive, but it's all for nothing! Surrender now, or most of you will be crushed right here! I'll give you one last chance&mdash;anyone willing to surrender, step back now, and I won't attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words sent a wave of dread through the Augustine family. Sebastian </span><span>scoffed,</span><span> his voice steely. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We, the Augustine family, would rather die fighting than surrender! You won't shake our resolve, Joseph!" With that, he gripped a black-and-gold scepter tightly. It was the Godfather's Scepter! "Kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian raised the scepter high, and an immense power surged forth from Mount Celestial Reach, slamming into Joseph, who staggered back, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's expression shifted to shock. He fixed his gaze on the scepter, his eyes glinting with greed. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of divine artifact is that? How can a Junior Deity wield such power? Even I can't fully withstand it! But once I take you down, that scepter will be mine! Go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With renewed fury, Joseph and his allies launched another wave of attacks. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Sebastian's newfound strength, comparable to a Superior Deity thanks to the scepter, they still struggled to hold their ground. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each clash, members of the Augustine family were forced to cough up blood, their Divine Bodies riddled with injuries. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More and more of them felt their strength waning, teetering on the edge of collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation was dire. Sebastian, Anastasia, and the others were frantic, but they had no viable options left. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce swung the Trident of Poseidon with reckless abandon, his power rivaling that of an Intermediate Deity. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia unleashed the </span><span>Thundergod</span><span> Gloves and the Volt Hammer, summoning a tempest of lightning, but even that wasn't enough to turn the tide against Joseph's superior forces. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming strength of the Superior Deities was becoming painfully clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Former Godfather, we can't hold out much longer!" one of the Augustine fighters shouted. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's retreat!" another urged. Each member of the Augustine family was battling against despair, struggling to maintain their defenses. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew that if they didn't retreat soon, they would all perish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian muttered, "Retreat? We can't! There are thousands of our kin in the Augustine Bastion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If we fall back now, they'll be left vulnerable. Against Joseph and his Superior Deities, they wouldn't stand a chance! We can't retreat!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood streamed from Sebastian's mouth as he spoke, his eyes wild with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair hung heavy in the air, and while the Augustine family felt the weight of hopelessness, Joseph and his team sensed victory was within their grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, a sudden, disdainful snort echoed through the air. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A melodious voice began, "It took me months to fully adapt to this new Divine Body. But who would have thought that the world has changed so drastically."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes turned as a stunning woman emerged slowly from the depths of the Augustine Estate's dungeon. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wore a serene smile as she glanced at Sebastian and his comrades, her eyes brimming with surprise, before shifting her gaze to Joseph and his four allies. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, it's not too late for you to </span><span>scram</span><span>," she declared, wrapping them in a chilling aura of murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph and his companions immediately bristled, hastily regrouping while fixating their wary gazes on the mysterious woman. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph exclaimed, his voice tinged with panic, "Transcendent Deity! Who are you? Do you intend to side with the Augustine family? Do you even know who we are?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman offered a bland smile, her tone unruffled. "Who am I? You can call me the God of Stars. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yes, I am well aware of your status. During the Age of Gods, your Deschanel Clan was a renowned divine clan in the eastern continent, boasting a top-tier Deity Overlord. Back then, as a rogue god, I would have certainly avoided tangling with you. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this is no longer the Age of Gods! Moreover, Osborne of the Augustine family has </span><span>shown me great kindness. If you think you can harm his kin without my approval, think again."</span></p><div class="pagination">
