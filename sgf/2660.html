  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't know if Adriana, Clara, and the others were facing the same situation as he was.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they were facing the same situation, they would definitely be doomed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even with Adriana's strength, on such a battlefield, she was nothing more than an ant, not even qualified to join the fight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as she was grazed by the aftermath of the battlefield, even wearing the Inferior Imperial Artifact Panoply Armor, her body would likely collapse instantly, leading to her complete death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned tightly and asked, "Do I have no choice but to wait here for the Eighth Skyfall Casket to close and then be transported away?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial couldn't think of any solution at the moment. "There really aren't any resources or treasures around here. After all, apart from the ruins of this Ancient Battlefield being real, everything else is just power projection. However, you can try using Satan's Eye to take a look first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"These battles are repetitive and follow a pattern. You can try to find a safe way out of here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Osborne was very excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although the battles around him were intense and dense, there were always gaps unaffected by the power fluctuations, and these gaps were the safe zones. Through these safe zones, he might be able to leave this Ancient Battlefield.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For example, the spot where he was standing now was an Absolutely Safe Zone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The forces of all the battles around did not reach here. If Osborne could find more such Absolutely Safe Zones, or even Relatively Safe Zones that were safe at certain moments, he could use these safe zones to gradually leave this place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately took action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He pushed Satan's Eye to its limit, carefully observing the recurring battles around him, and kept marking each safe zone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, "3,106 miles ahead, a Relatively Safe Zone appears every three minutes. For three seconds, no forces reach there. I can use spatial power to teleport myself there. As long as I leave within three seconds and enter the next safe zone, I&rsquo;ll be safe."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"9,320 miles to my front left, a Relatively Safe Zone appears every fourteen seconds. For one second, no forces reach there. And further ahead, 4,349 miles away..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, not only was Osborne's Satan's Eye fully activated, but his brain was also working furiously. The world he saw seemed to transform into a 3D map, and the shockwaves from the fierce battles became untouchable hazardous substances to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He needed to locate every Relatively Safe Zone and Absolutely Safe Zone within these shockwaves, then use these safe zones to leave the Ancient Battlefield.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "Luckily, I have spatial power. Otherwise, even if I could find a way out, leaving here would be impossible."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, a escape route gradually emerged in Osborne's mind, composed of hundreds of Relatively Safe Zones and Absolutely Safe Zones, stretching to the edge of Satan's Eye's visible range.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Further ahead was still the battlefield, but Osborne's Satan's Eye could no longer see that far.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At the edge of my vision, there's an Absolutely Safe Zone. I need to reach that Absolutely Safe Zone first before continuing to find the escape route." Thinking this, Osborne took a deep breath and decided to take action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He simulated every step of the action in his mind again, ensuring no mistakes, as this escape route had many Relatively Safe Zones that would only exist for one or two seconds.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the slightest mistake could cause him to miss the timing of the safe zone's appearance and be killed instantly by the forces of battle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, some safe zones were extremely small.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had to use interdimensional travel with extreme precision to enter the safe zone. If his position was even slightly off, he would be caught in the chaotic aftermath of the battle and lose his life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, this was really tough!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne's brain was working frantically, calculating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, after simulating dozens of times, Osborne was ready to act. "I really hope I won't mess up."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression was extremely serious. What came next would test his control over power. Even the slightest fluctuation could lead to problems and mistakes, and what awaited him was death from the battle's ripples.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If not for Osborne having the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, and the fact that even if he died, he could revive in the safe zone, he truly wouldn&rsquo;t dare to try&mdash;because this was practically courting death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I don't believe others are facing situations this difficult and dangerous. If that's the case, no one could gain anything from the Skyfall Casket. After all, once faced with such circumstances, we either wait in place for the Skyfall Casket to close and get teleported out, or die inside the Skyfall Casket."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne felt helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He always felt he had good luck. If beings like the Creator Deity truly existed, he believed he was the one being looked after.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sometimes, his luck was so good that even he found it a bit ridiculous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this time, Osborne felt his luck had hit rock bottom. After entering the Skyfall Casket, it was as if he had stepped into hell.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even if I've entered hell, I will turn this around. This is just an Ancient Battlefield. It can't trap me! I will definitely leave this dangerous Ancient Battlefield and obtain the real resources and treasures within the Skyfall Casket." Thinking this, Osborne adjusted his mindset.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, he moved. His body instantly vanished from where he was and reappeared 3,106 miles ahead. Just before he appeared, a terrifying force capable of annihilating any warrior below Imperial Empyrean Sacredness swept through the area and then disappeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the moment it vanished, Osborne appeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, there were no remnants of battle around him. However, this situation would only last for three seconds. After three seconds, an even more terrifying force would appear here. If Osborne hadn't left by then, he would be instantly killed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Osborne wasn't in a hurry because the next safe zone would only appear in two seconds. He had to wait for it to appear before performing interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a boom, a terrifying force rushed toward him. At the same time, the next safe zone finally appeared. Immediately, Osborne vanished from where he stood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, that terrifying force struck where he had been standing, destroying everything around it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne had already appeared in another safe zone thousands of miles away. This safe zone would last for over ten seconds.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne immediately performed a third interdimensional travel upon arriving here, as the next safe zone had already appeared, and it would only last for one second.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he missed this one second, he would have to wait another five minutes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he didn&rsquo;t have that much time, as he would be killed in just over ten seconds.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Osborne appeared in the third safe zone and immediately performed a fourth interdimensional travel. But this time, he was extremely nervous because the fourth safe zone was very small, just enough to fit one person.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If his interdimensional travel was even slightly off in distance, he would be killed instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, Osborne had achieved an extremely powerful level of control over his abilities. His interdimensional travel went flawlessly. He landed precisely in that very narrow safe zone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he performed the fifth interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sixth...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The tenth...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The hundredth...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Following the predetermined escape route, Osborne advanced quickly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
