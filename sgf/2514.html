  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, numerous Sacred Artifact warships appeared in various cities on Inferno Planet, all heading toward the Phantomagic Realm in the void.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In just the city where Osborne and his companions were, there were at least hundreds of Sacred Artifact warships. They raced to break through the sky, swiftly approaching the Phantomagic Realm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On Inferno Planet, at least tens of thousands of Sacred Artifact warships took off. At the same time, numerous other flying Sacred Artifacts, and even some Apex divine artifact warships below the Sacredness Level, were also charging toward the Phantomagic Realm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, they seemed a bit too slow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Phantomagic Realm hung in the void. Osborne estimated that Inferior Sacred Artifact warships would take about half an hour to reach the edge of the Phantomagic Realm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mid-grade Sacred Artifact warships would need only a few minutes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those Apex divine artifacts would take several days to approach the Phantomagic Realm. Fortunately, the Phantomagic Realm would remain here for a month, so they still had time to explore and collect Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stared at the countless flying vessels in the sky without taking immediate action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, aren't you leaving yet?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head. "No rush. I'm looking for the Frenetic Storm Warband's warship! The Phantomagic Realm is peculiar. Once we enter it, we'll either die inside or have to wait a month until the void rift reappears to leave!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If the Frenetic Storm Warband members don't enter the Phantomagic Realm, then I won't go in either!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His expression was serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Osborne really wanted the Dragon Elixir in the Phantomagic Realm, which would greatly help him improve his strength, saving his parents was more important.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He would only enter after confirming that the Frenetic Storm Warband's warship had also entered the Phantomagic Realm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne activated his Satan's Eye, searching among the tens of thousands of warships and various aircraft for the Frenetic Storm Warband's emblem.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked around but found nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He immediately frowned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Could the information I got from Layne be false? The Frenetic Storm Warband members won't return to Inferno Planet or enter the Phantomagic Realm?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was a bit anxious at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he noticed many warships taking off from the northern hemisphere of Inferno Planet. Among them, he spotted Blossom Cage's warships, but still found no trace of the Frenetic Storm Warband.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Blossom Cage's warship is a Superior Sacred Artifact! That's truly powerful! Among all the forces, there are no more than five Superior Sacred Artifact warships!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"On that warship, there are fewer than a hundred people in total! However, this shouldn't be all of Blossom Cage. They're just the ones deliberately exposed in the open."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne saw Romina, Dalia, and several other Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection warriors aboard Blossom Cage's warship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But aside from them, there were no stronger warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The leader of Blossom Cage is not on this warship!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne became vigilant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he still didn't know who the leader of Blossom Cage was. If that leader, still lurking in the shadows, launched a plan prepared for thousands of years, the outcome could be terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But soon, Osborne stopped worrying about it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He suddenly noticed another fleet of warships approaching Phantomagic Realm from a different direction. Among them, he immediately recognized the emblem of the Frenetic Storm Warband.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He instantly became excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, the Frenetic Storm Warband didn't return to Inferno Planet but stayed on another nearby small planet. They waited for Phantomagic Realm to appear before heading there from another direction!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's Satan's Eye activated to its fullest extent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the warships of the Frenetic Storm Warband were very far from him. In the vast starry sky, even Empyrean Sacredness warriors could only see a tiny black dot, but Osborne could clearly see the situation on the warships.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's a Mid-grade Sacred Artifact warship!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There are nearly thirty people on board, all of them mid-to-high-ranking members of the Frenetic Storm Warband, including the captain who has reached Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, as well as two vice-captains! In addition, there are ten advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors, and the rest are all mid Empyrean Sacredness warriors!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's gaze was incomparably cold at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, five warships had already entered the Phantomagic Realm. They were all Superior Sacred Artifacts. Their speed was the fastest, and they arrived without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, the warships of the Frenetic Storm Warband, from another planet closer to the Phantomagic Realm, had also approached there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They also didn't hesitate and rushed straight in.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't until they disappeared into the Phantomagic Realm that Osborne took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, I'm ready to go!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You stay here to back me up. If you notice any movement from Blossom Cage, follow the plan."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took out an Inferior Sacred Artifact warship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela nodded and then worriedly reminded him, "Don't worry. Everything is under our control! But you also need to be careful. Even without Blossom Cage's schemes, the Phantomagic Realm is very dangerous. One careless move and you could end up dead in there!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't push yourself too hard! Dragon Elixir may be precious, but it's never more valuable than your life! After you find the Frenetic Storm Warband, find a place to hide and wait for the Phantomagic Realm to open!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Also, be careful of the leader of the Frenetic Storm Warband! His cultivation level has reached Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection. Don't clash with him! Remember, your goal is only to save your parents, not to destroy the Frenetic Storm Warband!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha hesitated for a moment and also urged, "Osborne, stay safe! With your talent, even without the Dragon Elixir, you are destined to become a supreme warrior! So, you must come out alive!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright. I know what to do!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he activated the Inferior Sacred Artifact warship, swiftly soaring into the sky, heading toward the Phantomagic Realm in the void.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, at least hundreds of thousands, possibly even more, entered there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among these people, the weakest were primary Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, warriors below Empyrean Sacredness level could hardly survive in the Phantomagic Realm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, </span><span>Osborne</span><span> is an exception.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He controlled the Inferior Sacred Artifact warship, heading toward the Frenetic Storm Warband's entry point into the Phantomagic Realm, intending to enter from the same place. This way, he would surely have a better chance of encountering them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Half an hour later, Osborne arrived at the edge of the Phantomagic Realm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Here, he could sense an extremely powerful and terrifying force inside, though the specific form of the force was unclear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, most forces with Sacred Artifact aircraft had already entered the Phantomagic Realm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was already falling behind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without any hesitation, he followed the Frenetic Storm Warband's position and charged straight into the Phantomagic Realm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Osborne felt a wave of dizziness, as if he had undergone a long-distance starfield teleportation. When he recovered, he found the world before him had completely changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he was still in a sea of mist, but it was no longer as dark. Here, countless small celestial bodies were densely packed, stretching endlessly like an asteroid belt to an unimaginably distant place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even with Satan's Eye, Osborne couldn't see far here, as his view was blocked by the numerous celestial bodies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Is this the Phantomagic Realm?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Seems a bit peaceful."</span></p><div class="pagination">
