  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne called out to Xanto, who turned to him with a puzzled expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there something else you need? If you're looking for me to help you deal with that arrogant scion from the Baxter family, save your breath. I have no reason to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Baxter family is one of the ten major families in the Human Community, a Dukedom Level Power. Even the Sanctum of Light wouldn't dare to act against them lightly. We rely on them to fend off the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So unless he commits an unforgivable offense, even the esteemed God of Light wouldn't bother to teach him a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll have to handle your own grievances with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a bit awkward after Xanto's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cleared his throat, gathering his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hodge, I'm not asking you to deal with Kurt! I can handle that spoiled brat myself! What I want to know is that you mentioned that if I were the 'Theodore' from the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, you could sell me a military map. Why is that 'Theodore' allowed to buy one while I'm not? What do I need to qualify for such a purchase?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't admit that he was indeed the "Theodore" in question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xanto didn't seem to dwell on it, responding casually, "The reason that 'Theodore' can buy a military map is that he has made significant contributions to the Human Community. You can't buy one simply because your contributions aren't enough. Military maps are classified, meant only for those who are deemed trustworthy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured to himself, "Significant contributions? What contributions?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't even pinpoint what massive contributions he had made to the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, "I've only taken down a few hundred Deity Kings under Lord Malevolence, but what does that really mean?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of all those Deity Kings, only Hubery was at the peak of his realm. That hardly shakes the foundations of the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it because I've brought some prestige to the Human Community?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe it's about me defeating the young talents of the various races in that arena?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xanto simply smiled gently, a knowing look in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's understandable that you're not familiar with the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings yet. Normal channels of information can take time to relay such news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, I can fill you in a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That 'Theodore' you mentioned is the leader of the Seven Young Deity Kings. His talent is extraordinary, a once-in-a-century prodigy within the Human Community. In the East Zone, controlled by the Dark Deity Legion, he set up a challenge arena for the young talents of various races, taking on their best and brightest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the end, he and his companions crushed the competition, even defeating the young talents of the Paramount Supreme Clan! They managed to kill one of the Five Brilliant Scions, Caesar!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Furthermore, they lured over five hundred Deity Kings to Divine Peak Nine in the East Zone and wiped them all out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This battle boosted the morale of our Human Community significantly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When the esteemed God of Light learned about this, she was overjoyed and even sent someone to the East Zone to bring them back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unfortunately, it seems they've gone into hiding. Not only has the Paramount Supreme Clan been unable to find them, but even our own people have no clue where they are now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In any case, the God of Light holds the Seven Young Deity Kings in high regard, praising them as the hope for the future of the Human Community. By taking down Caesar, a potential high-tier Supernal Deity King, they've done a great service for us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their actions have proven their loyalty to the Human Community, which is why they're eligible to purchase military maps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to buy one too... well, you'd need to take down a Paramount Supreme Clan Five Brilliant Scion to earn that privilege."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Xanto finished speaking, Osborne awkwardly rubbed the back of his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was stunned to realize that the God of Light was already aware of his exploits and had even sent someone to retrieve the Seven Young Deity Kings, praising them as the future of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This filled him with an immense sense of pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne felt a strong urge to tell Xanto that he was, in fact, the "Theodore" in question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he held back, instead voicing his concern, "Wait, so I need to kill one of the Paramount Supreme Clan's Five Brilliant Scions just to buy a military map? That's a tall order! They're usually holed up in the Paramount Supreme Clan's stronghold. How am I supposed to take one out? I can't just storm into their lair, can I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Xanto couldn't help but chuckle at Osborne's naivety. "You fool! I was just using that as a figure of speech.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really think you could take on a Paramount Supreme Clan Five Brilliant Scion? Those guys are super geniuses!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as they're alive, they're bound to become high-tier Supernal Deity Kings sooner or later. What makes you think you could kill one?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wry smile, Xanto shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough of this nonsense. You can forget about the military map. It's not happening! But if you're really keen on getting one, you might want to check with the Hudson family... they have military maps!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
