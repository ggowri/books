  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne spoke up again, everyone stared at him in disbelief. Their faces were etched with doubt and mistrust. It was natural they acted this way as they all knew Seth's situation all too clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seth's last shred of vitality was long gone. Even the legendary white Miracle Elixir might not be enough to bring him back. Sure, it was famous for reviving the recently deceased, but it wasn't a miracle worker without limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some, being "dead" just meant their organs had shut down, but their vitality hadn't fully dispersed yet. In those cases, the white Miracle Elixir could work wonders. But Seth's case was different&mdash;his vitality was completely gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can he really... still be saved?" someone murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Zachary shouted, "Move aside! Whether Osborne can pull it off or not, this is our last shot, isn't it? Do you have a better idea? No? Then step back and let him try!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Zachary stepped out of the room himself, his gaze full of hope and encouragement as he looked at Osborne. "Do whatever you need to do, Osborne. We all believe in you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, everyone had cleared out of the room, leaving only Osborne and Seth behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting a moment, Osborne waved his hand and opened a dimensional portal. He reached out to Hannah, who stopped her training and stepped out of Hope Haven in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the Hudson family members outside noticed another figure in the room&mdash;a girl&mdash;they were instantly stunned. Then, their expressions shifted. "That's someone from the Mystic Feather Clan," someone muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hudson family tensed, their brows furrowing as a wary, guarded look spread across their faces. It was because Hannah wasn't part of the Human Community&mdash;she was from the Mystic Feather Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the years, the Hudson family had suffered heavy losses on the battlefield against the Dark Deity Legion, with nearly a million of their kin perishing in the conflict.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the Mystic Feather Clan wasn't the largest faction in the legion, they were far from rare. Naturally, the Hudson family harbored a deep resentment toward them, including anyone from the Mystic Feather Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing the tension and hostility from the Hudson family, Osborne quickly spoke up, "Uncles, aunts, please hear me out. This is Hannah Gellar. She's my friend. She's never harmed the Human Community&mdash;in fact, she's gone out of her way to help us time and time again. Right now, she's the only one who can save Uncle Seth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His explanation softened their expressions slightly, though their wariness didn't fully fade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't waste any more time and turned to Hannah. "This is my uncle. He used the Hudson family's forbidden deadly technique, which caused his vitality to leak uncontrollably. Now, his vitality is almost completely drained. Please take a look&mdash;can you save him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah quickly nodded. "Alright."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, she turned to Seth and got to work immediately. As soon as she activated her life power, a low hum filled the air. Then, an intense surge of vitality appeared and, under her control, poured rapidly into Seth's body. His pale face instantly regained its color, becoming rosy and vibrant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the room, Zachary and the others felt the overwhelming vitality emanating from within. Shocked, they couldn't help but exclaim, staring at Hannah in disbelief. "Life power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Life power was incredibly rare&mdash;rarer even than spatial or time powers. None of them had expected Hannah to possess such an extraordinary ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, excitement swept through them. With the immense vitality surging into Seth, his condition visibly improved at an astonishing rate. The results were far better than even the legendary Miracle Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Hudson family were overjoyed. When they looked at Hannah now, their previous hostility was completely replaced by gratitude and awe. They gazed at her as though she were a goddess of life itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A loud hum resounded as Seth suddenly opened his eyes, his expression dazed. He wondered, "Wasn't I dead? But why... why do I feel so full of vitality? What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another loud hum rang out as Hannah continued channeling vitality into him, ensuring it fully replenished his body before finally stopping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the moment Hannah halted, his vitality began leaking out again. It was clear she had only replenished his vitality but hadn't truly healed his injuries. She knew that if this continued, his vitality would dissipate once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She frowned, "His injuries are unusual. With my current abilities, I can't fully heal him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, the Hudson family members were overwhelmed with gratitude, their eyes red with emotion as they looked at Hannah. "Thank you. Thank you so much, miss. You've done incredibly well. At least Seth is no longer in immediate danger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled in their eyes as they spoke. This outcome was already enough for them. Though Seth wasn't completely healed, he was alive, and the abundant vitality around him was all thanks to Hannah. It was enough to sustain him for a long while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "Leave the healing to me." With that, he summoned the power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was powerful enough to bring the dead back to life, so healing Seth's injuries was a simple task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, another soft hum filled the air again. Moments later, Seth's vitality stopped leaking altogether. He was completely healed.</span></p><div class="pagination">
