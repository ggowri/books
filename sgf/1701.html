  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? This can't be happening!" Chandler exclaimed, shock evident in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood there, completely taken aback, sensing Osborne's rapid ascent in power. In the blink of an eye, Osborne had risen from the early stage of Deity Overlord to the pinnacle</span><span>, </span><span>on the verge of breaking through to Deity King. It sent a chill down Chandler's spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of technique is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler realized that as Osborne grew stronger, so did the power of his Spatial Clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even at the earlier Deity Overlord stage, Osborne and his eight clones had already </span><span>posed a significant challenge to Chandler. If Osborne continued to rise in strength, the tables would turn dramatically, and Chandler feared he might actually fall here today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nervously watching Osborne, Chandler felt a flicker of hope when he noticed that Osborne had paused after reaching the peak of the Deity Overlord level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler said, his expression hardening, "Listen up, I don't know what bizarre trick you're pulling to boost your power like this, but I won't give you another chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm unleashing my ultimate move, and once you're still not a Deity King, you'll be dead for sure!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished speaking, Chandler's demeanor shifted to one of grim determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flames erupted around him</span><span> and</span><span> start</span><span>ed </span><span>as a fierce crimson blaze that swiftly morphed into a pale blue, then white, and finally deepened into a terrifying black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dark flames leaped into the air, sending out waves of scorching heat that rippled outward. Nearby, Angelo, Arnold, and Mariah felt the immense heat wash over them and immediately scrambled to distance themselves from the explosion of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne found himself at the epicenter of the chaos. The overwhelming heat began to erode his divine power defenses, melting them away in moments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne remained unperturbed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're finally busting out your big guns? You claim that anyone who isn't a Deity King would be toast against your ultimate move? Ha! You're full of hot air! Besides, I could reach Deity King if I wanted to, but I don't see the need!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, instead of retreating, Osborne stepped toward Chandler with purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With over four thousand Blood Demon members by his side</span><span>, </span><span>all at the pinnacle of the Deity Overlord stage</span><span>, </span><span>Osborne had the resources at hand to temporarily borrow their power and easily push himself past the Deity King threshold, maybe even into the mid-tier of Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he felt it unnecessary for this fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just tapping into a fraction of their strength to bolster himself to the peak of the Deity Overlord realm was already more than enough to deal with Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even as the waves of heat engulfed him and his divine power defenses crumbled, a stronger shield of divine power enveloped his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming heat could no longer burn him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now standing at the pinnacle of Deity Overlord, Osborne felt renewed vigor coursing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bring it on! Let me see what your ultimate attack has in store!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gestured at Chandler, a teasing challenge in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler's face darkened as he recognized the seriousness of the moment. Watching Osborne stand resolute against the blistering heat without so much as flinching filled him with dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could someone merely at the peak of Deity Overlord withstand such power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was incomprehensible, and he felt a surge of anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy is a monster! He needs to be taken down!" Chandler thought, fury igniting within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black flames coiling around him blazed even hotter, threatening to scorch the very sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heat warped the air around them, distorting space itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to dance with death? Fine then! Inferno Feral Tiger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler unleashed everything he had. In an instant, the black flames that enveloped him surged outward</span><span> and </span><span>coalesc</span><span>ed</span><span> into a massive, fearsome fire tiger. With a roar that shook the very air, it lunged toward Osborne, who, at this moment, appeared insignificantly small, destined to be consumed and reduced to ashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming force radiating from the dark tiger threatened to overpower Osborne. His divine power defenses crumbled and melted away under sheer pressure, and the closer the flaming beast approached, the more the sense of danger loomed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne remained calm and collected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Abyssal Spear!" he bellowed, and a colossal black spear materialized before him, its inky depth seeming to draw in the light around it as if swallowing the very essence of illumination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's end this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the Abyssal Spear shot forward</span><span> and </span><span>collid</span><span>ed</span><span> with the charging fire tiger. The resulting impact rattled the ground for hundreds of miles, the earth itself cracking and vibrating like shattered glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black spear struck the tiger squarely on its forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an explosion of energy, the tiger's head burst apart, followed by its massive form disintegrating under the relentless force of the spear, which still held momentum as it barreled toward Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?! This can't be happening?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler was stunned that his ultimate attack had been thwarted and shattered by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black spear surged forward with such incredible speed that he had no time to evade it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spear collided with Chandler</span><span> and</span><span> smash</span><span>ed</span><span> through his divine power defenses as if they were mere paper and then piercing his Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tremendous bloodied hole appeared in Chandler's chest, the Abyssal Spear having punched through his body and causing catastrophic damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood erupted from the wound</span><span> and</span><span> pour</span><span>ed</span><span> out in a horrifying torrent.</span></p><div class="pagination">
