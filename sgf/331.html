  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason why Xavier had not stopped breathing yet was not that his vitality was more vigorous with higher power. For Osborne, a Class C+ metahuman was not different from an ordinary person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he wanted Xavier dead, it wouldn't cost him more effort than crushing an ant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Xavier stayed alive only because of his identity as the leader of these pirates. Osborne remained calm right before ending his last breath, meaning to gain more information from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a crushing sound, Xavier's burned body was thrown to the ground, and he immediately let out a shrill scream and twisted in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This pathetic scene didn't raise Osborne's sympathy at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scum had captured and raped countless women, with many of his victims dying miserably under his torture. Those chained women not far away from him were the most apparent evidence of Xavier's crimes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This bastard should be slaughtered a thousand times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath to suppress the anger in his heart. Then, he contacted Yulissa and the other two people outside the cave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, waving his hand, Osborne turned a strong wind into a sharp blade to cut off the chains that bound the women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But none of them moved; they just stared at him in a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had no clue of who he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were worried that Osborne was a devil more terrifying than Xavier, who would treat them more cruelly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are free! I'll have someone prepare a ship to take you away from here. You're free now. You can go home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The women were stunned for a moment, and then some of them couldn't help but sob in fear, and the sobs soon turned into howling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The days they were imprisoned here were like a nightmare. In fact, the nightmare was beyond description; they were in hell!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, Osborne told them that they were free!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could go home!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cries filled the cave, and the desperate eyes of dozens of women gradually regained some spirit. One of them knelt before Osborne, and shouted "thank you" loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, more and more people knelt down to thank Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hesitating for a moment, he ultimately said nothing, knowing it was only a way to vent their fear as these women's spirits had reached their limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was their way to let off the suppressed feelings in their hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Yulissa, Ryan, and Nathan finally arrived at where Osborne was and saw dozens of ragged women kneeling down to thank Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all stunned on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, they realized why they did that and all regretted not having the chance to slaughter the pirates for these pitiful women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, they all glared at Xavier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Asshole! Scum!" All three of them rushed towards him and started punching and kicking his charred body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't kill him. I still have to use him," Osborne reminded them and then turned around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not knowing when, he found that pretty girl named Kendra had walked behind him. As her clothes were torn apart by Xavier, a lot of her fair skin was exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne turning around, she blushed and quickly covered her breasts with both hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought about it, opened the Dimensional Space, took out some clothes and handed it to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Just put on some clothes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne put a variety of things in his Dimensional Space in case of emergency. He even prepared a lot of women's clothes, which came in handy at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra was stunned for a moment, obviously not knowing where Osborne had taken out the dress, but this was not the time to think about it, so she quickly took it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks! Can you, um, can you help cover my body?" She </span><span>said</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Sure!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he turned his back to Kendra, using his broad back to shield her while she changed into her dress behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'm done." After a while, she whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne then turned around and was stunned by how she looked after changing into clean clothes. Kendra seemed more beautiful with her radiant face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was in her twenties and was about 5.7 feet high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My name is Kendra Clarkson. Thank you for saving me. If it weren't for you, I would probably be killed by that bastard just now. Can you tell me your name? Don't worry, I will pay for your kindness! My brother is the most powerful pirate in this sea, and he will also thank you!" She said seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "My name is Osborne, but no thanks. The reason why I saved you was not because of your identity, nor did I do that for a reward. Just leave now. A ship will come to pick you up and take you ashore. I still have some things to take care of here. Bye."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he no longer paid attention to Kendra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra was indeed very beautiful, but that had nothing to do with him. Neither did he think Kendra was really Bryce's sister; even if she was, he didn't care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he just wanted to quickly interrogate Xavier and find out the information about </span><span>the mastermind behind the vile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, those women were taken out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne walked up to Xavier, who was as haggard and miserable as rotten meat, and snorted coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He directly took out the truth serum and stuffed it into Xavier's throat.</span></p><div class="pagination">
