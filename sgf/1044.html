  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time went on, Osborne's physical improvement speed was still accelerating. When </span><span>his physical strength exceeded 50 points, it increased rate was 2 points per hour, and the pain he endured reached level 17, which had already exceeded the record.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mental fluctuations became irregular. The people watching him were shocked, and they immediately called Gerardo over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo arrived soon. After seeing Osborne's physical data records, he was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's physical strength increased from 9 points to 50 points in just 30 hours, and the pace of improvement had been increased to 2 points per hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, with current speed, Osborne's physical strength would reach 98 points in another day. It would be close to 100 points, which was the average physical strength rate of top-tier Class S warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Physical strength was not the only factor that could be used to measure a warrior's strength. The use of powers, the level of realms, and even the strength of divine artifacts were all essential factors in evaluating warriors' strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo knew that Osborne had no shortcomings in all these aspects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne's physical strength reached 100 points, it would be very challenging for a </span><span>top Class</span><span> S warrior to hurt Osborne, let alone defeat him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo knew very well that Osborne's defense of martial art aura was powerful. When Osborne's physical strength reached 100 points, his defense would be invincible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However</span><span>... Osborne was now taking severe pain, which had reached level 17!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of the pain, Gerardo couldn't help but feel fearful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a top-tier Class S warrior could only stand such pain for a few seconds at most. Most of them probably couldn't hold on for more than a minute, as their minds and souls would have collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo couldn't help thinking, "Osborne, how long can you hold on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is his conversion degree of enslavement?" Gerardo asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It has reached 21%."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Only 21%? The improvement speed of his physical strength has increased, but the enslavement speed has slowed down?" Gerardo was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The technician nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo asked, "How much culture medium has been consumed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"22%."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo changed expression. "The conversion degree of enslavement is 21%, but the culture medium consumption has reached 22%! Doesn't this mean that if his mind does not collapse in advance, even if Osborne completely absorbs the energy of the culture medium, the conversion can't be achieved?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The technician nodded with difficulty. "For now, the result seems like this. If Osborne can fully absorb the energy, his body strength will be over 200 points."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Over 200 points?" Gerardo was stunned, thinking, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doesn't that mean Osborne's physical strength is much stronger than mine? My physical strength is only 180 points in normal cases!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The technician continued, "However, according to the current improvement speed, it will take at least 80 hours for him to absorb all the energy in the culture medium.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But he is enduring the level 17 pain. No one can endure it for 8 hours, let alone 80 </span><span>hours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Gerardo snorted coldly, "Are you sure? Do you think he is an average person? Even if a person has top Class S strength, he would hardly hold on for a minute in such severe pain. Look at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been here for more than five minutes, but his mental fluctuations are still the same as before. It looks unstable, but in fact, it shows no signs of collapsing at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure he can't hold on for 8 hours or even 80 hours?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, the technician fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo was right. Osborne was not an average person at all, and he could not even be described as a "human". How could anyone endure the pain at level 17 for such a long time without his mind collapsing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo had a grim face. "Humph! Osborne is very important to me. No accidents are allowed. I must make sure that his enslavement is successful! If the enslavement fails, all my efforts will be in vain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the culture medium is not enough, just replenish it. Stop the enslavement of other people and keep the remaining culture medium on standby. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the culture medium in Osborne's culture tank is not enough, immediately replenish it. No matter what, you must ensure that his enslavement is successful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The technician said sternly, "But those are just ordinary cultural mediums. Mixing them with the premium one is very dangerous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo said sternly, "Then put all the medicines in my warehouse. I'm going to get the god's heart blood now. I don&rsquo;t care what you do, just make that enslavement successful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Gerardo left quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's changes made Gerardo both excited and worried. He was excited because Osborne's improvement was much better than the best outcome he had expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the enslavement was completed, Osborne would become Gerardo's sharpest and most potent weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Gerardo worried about was...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enslavement would probably fail!</span></p><div class="pagination">
