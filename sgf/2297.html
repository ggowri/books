  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danilo's jaw dropped so hard it might as well have hit the ground when he saw the leaderboard refresh. He gulped nervously, still in a state of utter shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a moment earlier, he'd been calling Osborne a dumbass for charging into the sixth layer. He was convinced there was no way Osborne could last more than a few minutes in there, let alone find a token.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, out of the blue! Osborne's score skyrocketed by 100 thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was only one logical explanation&mdash;the moment Osborne stepped into the sixth layer, he just happened to stumble upon a token. He quickly registered it on his badge and scored a ton of state </span><span>duel</span><span> points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was how he shot straight up to second place, neck-and-neck with Broderick and Benson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd in Frost Peak City, with their eyes glued to the leaderboard, let out a collective gasp and started buzzing with excitement. Most of them had never even heard of Osborne before. They were frantically scouring the strength rankings to find his name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Discovering that he was way down at the 108th spot on the rankings only cranked up their surprise a notch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, there were only around twenty contestants who could really hold their own against the savage storms in the sixth layer and go token-hunting at will. Maybe fifty could tough it out for an hour or more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, ranked 108th, actually had the balls to enter the sixth layer?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he found a token and bagged a neat 100 thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Talk about crazy luck!" exclaimed one spectator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There </span><span>ain't</span><span> no cameras in the sixth layer, so we can't see what Osborne's up to. But he'll probably hightail it back to the fifth layer soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep your eyes peeled on the fifth-layer Translocator. We'll lay eyes on him before long!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm itching to see what this guy looks like..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela and Danilo glanced at each other, not quite sure if they should be over the moon or what.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, sitting pretty in second place, Osborne was bringing a whole heap of glory to the entire sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In all the previous state duels, no disciple from the Mystic Sirius Sect had ever made it this far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if this ranking was just a flash in the pan and was bound to be overtaken later, this was still an achievement that the Mystic Sirius Sect had never seen before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Second place!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela said, a smile spreading across her face, "Well, I'll be damned! I always knew that kid had it in him to blow us away! Even if he doesn't score another single point, 100 thousand points should be enough to get him into the top hundred, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danilo nodded. "From what we've seen in the past, 100 thousand points should do the trick to land him in the top hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But that's only if he can hang onto those points!" Danilo added, his tone turning grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first three days of the state duel were all about individual token-hunting and point-scoring. But the last four days were a free-for-all, where the contestants would go at each other like wild animals. On the final day, everyone had to head back to the first layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm for a no-holds-barred showdown, fighting tooth and nail for every last point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne's sitting on 100 thousand points. He's </span><span>gonna</span><span> be a prime target. Everyone's </span><span>gonna</span><span> be gunning for him, trying to snatch those points right </span><span>outta</span><span> his hands!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he can't defend them, he'll just be fattening up someone else's score!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela nodded. "</span><span>Osborne'll</span><span> probably find more tokens and boost his score. But holding onto those points? That's </span><span>gonna</span><span> be an uphill battle. Luckily, contestants only lose a tenth of their points when they're beaten. </span><span>So</span><span> if he racks up enough points at the start, his final score won't be half-bad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even as she said that, a spark of anticipation flashed in Angela's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne! Back in the city duel in Tempest Fortress City, no one gave you a snowball's chance in hell of winning. But I had faith in you. I bet ten thousand Sacred Crystals on you! And this time, folks still </span><span>ain't</span><span> buying it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm hoping you can keep making them eat their words."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, Angela fixed her eyes firmly on the fifth-layer Translocator. She was dead certain that Osborne would pop out from the sixth layer any moment now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Osborne set foot back on the fifth layer, the countless recording and projection devices would be all over him, capturing his every move and broadcasting it for the whole world to see.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as the seconds ticked by like a time bomb, Angela's expression grew grimmer and grimmer, and her anxiety skyrocketed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela frowned.</span><br><span>What is taking Osborne so long?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on what they knew about Osborne's abilities, he shouldn't have been able to last more than five minutes in the sixth layer, max. Any longer than that, and he'd be pushing his luck big time. He could end up six feet under, lost in the sixth layer forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, six minutes had already gone by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was still no sign of Osborne returning to the fifth layer. How could Angela not be worried sick out of her mind?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Could something </span><span style="font-style: italic;">have</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> gone haywire with Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela clenched her fists so tightly. If it weren't for the iron-clad rule that only state </span><span>duel</span><span> participants and referees were allowed inside the Arctic Maw Chasm, she'd have gone charging in there like a bull and hauled Osborne out by the scruff of his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All Angela could do was twiddle her thumbs and wait, saying desperate prayers that Osborne was okay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, the crowd let out a collective gasp that could have knocked the wind out of anyone. Every pair of eyes was glued to the leaderboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela whipped her head </span><span>around so fast,</span><span> it was like she'd been hit by a lightning bolt. Her eyes popped wide open in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top dog on the leaderboard had changed. Horace was no longer king of the hill; a new name had taken the number one spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne now held the top spot on the leaderboard with a staggering 300 thousand points!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant Osborne had just stumbled upon two more tokens on the sixth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole of Frost Peak City was abuzz with excitement and disbelief. Angela sucked in a sharp breath, too. Just a few minutes ago, she'd been worried sick that Osborne was a goner in the sixth layer, and now, he'd found two more tokens? It was like a plot twist straight out of a wild adventure story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the heck is he up to up there?" someone blurted out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How on earth can someone be this lucky?" another voice chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each token on the sixth layer was worth a whopping 100 thousand points, but they were rarer than hen's teeth and hidden in spots that were next to impossible to find. Trying to brave the sixth layer's howling storms to hunt down those tokens was a Herculean task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne had managed to find three of them in such a short period.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just crazy-lucky!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, everyone wrote off Osborne's success as pure dumb luck. They were dead-set on the idea that his lucky streak was bound to end soon, and he'd be hightailing it out of the sixth layer and back to the fifth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as they kept their eyes peeled on the fifth-layer Translocator, Osborne never showed his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His score on the leaderboard remained rock-solid, not budging an inch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time seemed to crawl by at a snail's pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten minutes ticked by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty minutes passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thirty minutes went by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour had slipped away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Contestants started trickling out of the sixth layer one by one. These were the folks ranked between 20th and 50th on the strength rankings. They just couldn't hack it in the sixth layer any longer and had to hightail it back to the fifth to recharge their Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even then, Osborne was still a no-show on the fifth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela had gone through the whole emotional rollercoaster, starting from the initial excitement and anticipation to the growing anxiety and worry. Now, her face was as white as a sheet, and her fists were balled up tight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour had gone by, and Osborne still hadn't made it back from the sixth layer. His score on the leaderboard was still stuck at 300 thousand, not budging an inch for nearly an hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What on earth did that mean?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela caught snippets of the hushed conversations around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That Osborne? He's probably six feet under in the sixth layer! There's no way someone with his so-called strength could last up there that long. Even the top fifty contestants have started bailing out, but Osborne's MIA."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, there's only one thing it could be. He's a goner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela's face went even paler, and she bit down on her lip so hard it almost bled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, deep in the sixth layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm, Osborne exclaimed, a wide grin spreading across his face, "That's the tenth token!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stuffed the newly found token into his pocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten tokens. If I log them all in, I'll be sitting on a cool million points..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
