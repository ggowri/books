  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time seemed to blur as nearly ten thousand explorers were unceremoniously ejected from the dimensional teleportation passage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they regained their footing, they found themselves in a bizarre and foreboding landscape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stood on a vast continent, where ominous clouds hung low in the sky, thick and impenetrable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lightning crackled violently, racing across the heavens like a spider's web, exuding an aura of impending doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beneath their feet lay dark, purplish-black soil that seemed to pull at them with a terrifying force, making each step feel like a Herculean effort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King would struggle to fly here; the very air felt heavy, and moving required a significant expenditure of divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the distance, flickering lights caught their attention&mdash;bioluminescent plants resembling enormous mushrooms formed a glowing forest, illuminating the otherwise dark surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have we really arrived at Umbra Earth?" Osborne mused, his expression tense and alert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a realm that had drifted from the Umbra World, where nothing could be taken for granted, and danger lurked behind every corner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think we have!" Alfreda replied, her face pale and her eyes darting around, a mix of curiosity, astonishment, and palpable fear etched across her features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was her first venture beyond Elf City, and she found herself in the perilous embrace of Umbra Earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stepped closer to Osborne, drawing comfort from his presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the explorers began to scatter across the eerie landscape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne noticed that several team members were already summoning their divine power, forming protective barriers around themselves, their expressions etched with vigilance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them was Prince Desmond, his demeanor serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne called out, his voice cutting through the tension, "Everyone, stay sharp! This is our first time on Umbra Earth, and we're all pretty green here. But some of the other teams have been here before and know the lay of the land better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gestured toward the other teams, noting their defensive postures. "Those folks have already set up their divine power defenses, which means there's likely some hidden danger around us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, Alfreda's eyes widened, and she nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avery, Neville, and the others exchanged worried glances, their expressions mirroring the gravity of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, they activated their own divine power defenses, scanning their surroundings for any signs of threat, but found only silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air was thick with tension, and the only sound was the ominous rumble of thunder overhead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avery and Neville turned to Alfreda, waiting for her command, but as the team leader, she felt a wave of uncertainty wash over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know what to do next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Glancing at Osborne, she sought guidance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had to speak up, "Let's hold our defenses for now. We need to see how the other teams handle this before making any moves. Our numbers are smaller, and we lack experience on this continent. Let's prioritize our safety first and figure out what we're dealing with before we even think about treasure hunting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words struck a chord, and everyone nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda felt a surge of confidence from Osborne's leadership. "Let's do that! Osborne, you stay in the center; we'll protect you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the group quickly rearranged themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda, Godfrey, Hermione, Neville, Beverly, and Cyrus with Ascension Five cultivation levels formed a protective circle around Avery, Arabela, and Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their smaller numbers, the team enjoyed a unique advantage&mdash;flexibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they had ensured that the immediate area was safe, all eyes turned toward the horizon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the distance loomed a vast forest of gigantic mushrooms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not far off, three fully-staffed exploration teams were gathered, their forms cloaked in divine power defenses, eyes fixed with a mix of anticipation and tension on the mushroom woods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, without warning, chaos erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahhhh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chilling scream pierced through the oppressive atmosphere, drowning even the thunderous roars of lightning above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Osborne's horror, he watched as three hundred members of the teams were seemingly hit simultaneously by unseen forces. Their divine power barriers shattered, bursting into splinters as bodies exploded in a gruesome display of blood and gore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a heartbeat, dozens of warriors&mdash;each one no weaker than Ascension Three&mdash;found themselves caught in the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even several with Ascension Four levels were reduced to mere casualties in this sudden attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What shocked Osborne even more was how he had been completely unaware of the threat lurking nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell just happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His bewildered gaze mirrored that of many nearby; shock and terror radiated from their faces as they stared at the unfolding brutality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, among the panicked explorers, a cool-headed prince from the Shadow Elf Clan, Lucian Bolton, stepped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clad in the power of an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King and with the poise of someone who'd been through this before, he raised his voice above the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quiet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay calm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Form a united defense!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been to this Umbra Earth before and know what we're up against!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion of his hand, a powerful surge of divine power shot forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a half-human-sized, nearly transparent creature with delicate wings emerged before him, struck down by Lucian's attack before it even knew what hit it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucian barked urgently, "It's the Ghostwing Insects attacking!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These creatures are unique to Umbra Earth&mdash;semi-transparent, soft-bodied insects with a nasty bite! Their penetrating attacks are formidable, and they can turn invisible, blending into the air. However, they can't disguise the energy vibrations they produce when they strike; that's how we can find and pin them down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a steadying breath. "Listen up, everyone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep your cool! Ghostwing Insects aren't particularly strong; any one of us can take them out! In fact, they're among the weakest and least dangerous creatures you'll encounter in Umbra Earth. If we can't handle these pests, we should reconsider whether we're suited for this mission!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Lucian's voice cut through the fear, a sense of calm began to settle over the teams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They started focusing on their surroundings, carefully sensing the energy waves that would signal the presence of the Ghostwing Insects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The great advantage of these insects lay in their ability to hide, but once discovered, their fragile forms could be dispatched easily by any Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, Ghostwing Insects were revealed, struck down, and exploded in bursts of luminescent mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the situation for the three exploration teams remained dire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they managed to eliminate hundreds, if not thousands of Ghostwing Insects, the delay in detecting the creatures meant that several Ascension Three and Four members had already met their doom, their remains splattered across the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And meanwhile, the true number of Ghostwing Insects surrounding them remained a mystery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one knew just how many more of these deadly bugs lurked in the shadows of the enormous mushroom forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The team could only brace themselves, ready to face whatever horrors Umbra Earth still had in store.</span></p><div class="pagination">
