  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne stared icily at Wesley, his anger and murderous intent towards him skyrocketing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But he didn&rsquo;t say anything, just raised his paddle again. &ldquo;Nine million dollars!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ten million dollars!&rdquo; Wesley sneered. &ldquo;The timing is perfect. My grandfather&rsquo;s 80th birthday is coming up. This longevity herb will make the ideal birthday gift.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You useless fool, don&rsquo;t you still have 50 million dollars? Let&rsquo;s keep going and see who&rsquo;s got deeper pockets.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne chuckled and ignored Wesley. He raised his paddle again. &ldquo;Twelve million dollars!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Thirteen million dollars!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Fifteen million dollars!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne and Wesley were locked in a bidding war. The price quickly approached 20 million dollars, far surpassing the value of the longevity herb. The other bidders had all thrown in the towel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But not Osborne or Wesley. They both had their reasons for not giving up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne needed the herb to save Anastasia&rsquo;s life. Therefore, no matter the cost, he had to win.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">On the other hand, Wesley was driven by pride and the desire to cause trouble for Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was Ophelia&rsquo;s ex-husband. There was no way Wesley could be indifferent. Wesley might not have cared if Osborne had always been a nobody.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After all, why would an elephant care about an ant?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Osborne had repeatedly made him lose face, especially in front of Ophelia. Wesley was thoroughly provoked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even though he knew the longevity herb wasn&rsquo;t worth 20 million dollars, he was dead set on competing with Osborne, refusing to back down an inch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Wesley&rsquo;s expression grew increasingly sour as the price continued to soar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Because Osborne had just bid 25 million dollars, and he didn&rsquo;t show the slightest sign of backing down or feeling the pinch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;This damn bastard.&rdquo; Wesley began to lose confidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His situation was similar to Ophelia&rsquo;s. Although he was an heir to a wealthy family, he didn&rsquo;t hold absolute power and was under the thumb of The Wise Order.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If he spent too much money on something that wasn&rsquo;t worth it, The Wise Order would punish him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley hesitated to make another bid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne remained calm throughout, even when he saw Wesley hesitate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He chose not to provoke him because he genuinely needed the longevity herb.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was worried that if he pushed Wesley too far, Wesley might go crazy with bidding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even though Osborne had 150 million dollars in his account, it was still a far cry from the wealth of the Ashford family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luckily, Wesley backed down in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The frantic bidding war concluded, and Osborne secured the herb for 25 million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When the herb was finally in his hands, he breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now, he could save Anastasia&rsquo;s life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, one longevity herb wasn&rsquo;t enough to ensure her safety, and Osborne hoped to acquire more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Fortunately, another longevity herb soon appeared on the auction block.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This time, it was a 400-year-old longevity herb known for its life-extending properties. Wesley was eager to regain his pride and immediately bid over ten million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">No one else dared to compete already when the price reached 15 million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley couldn&rsquo;t help but smirk at Osborne. &ldquo;You fool, this herb is far more potent than the one you bought. You spent 25 million dollars while I only spent 15 million dollars. You must feel pretty stupid wasting all that money, right?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne responded coldly, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re celebrating too soon. Who said you&rsquo;ve already won this herb? I haven&rsquo;t bid yet.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, Osborne raised his paddle. &ldquo;Twenty million dollars!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley was shocked. He looked at Osborne in disbelief. His whole body was trembling with rage. &ldquo;You! You! You!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Mr. Ashford, enough with the stammering. Are you going to bid or not? If not, I&rsquo;ll gladly take this herb off your hands.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley was furious. &ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;ll keep bidding. I&rsquo;ll offer 22 million dollars! If you have the guts, keep up. Even if I don&rsquo;t win, I&rsquo;ll make sure you burn through all your money.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne chuckled, &ldquo;As you wish. Twenty-three million dollars!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bid 24 million dollars!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Twenty-five million dollars. If you want to keep going, be my guest,&rdquo; Osborne said, looking at Wesley provocatively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley snorted and stopped bidding. He calculated Osborne&rsquo;s finances, noting that the 20 million dollars Osborne extorted from the Caldwell family and the 40 million dollars from selling the slots were all spent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If he bid again, he would defeat Osborne and win the herb, but Osborne would retain 25 million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley sneered, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re willing to spend all your savings to win, I&rsquo;ll let you have it. But now that you&rsquo;re broke again, I hope you won&rsquo;t regret it later.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne simply smiled. He was unperturbed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Godfather had rewarded him with 100 million dollars, which he hadn&rsquo;t touched yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley wanted to see him broke? Dream on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne smoothly acquired the second longevity herb. Though he spent 50 million dollars, he was finally at ease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He smiled at Wesley, &ldquo;Mr. Ashford, the auction is almost over, and I&rsquo;ve spent 60 million dollars, but it seems you haven&rsquo;t spent a dime. According to our bet, you must submit to me and acknowledge me as your superior.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley&rsquo;s face turned ashen.</p><div class="pagination">
