  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If Osborne wanted to upgrade his Satan&rsquo;s Eye to level three, he would need at least 22 pounds of top-quality diamond. Even if he used all glass-type diamonds, the piece he just bought would still be far from enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He needed more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Fortunately, there were enough raw stones here. Osborne sped up and soon found two valuable raw stones. Although they were not as good as the first one, they were at least worth millions of dollars or tens of millions of dollars after being cut.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was like a scanning machine, picking up all the raw stones worth over one million dollars in the Ashford family&rsquo;s raw stone casino.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As for those worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, Osborne didn&rsquo;t pick them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After he finished looking at all the rough materials, he selected a total of six raw stones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Their price tag was only a total of one hundred thousand dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After cutting them open completely, the total value of the diamond inside was at least over 300 million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, this was far from enough to what Osborne needed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne couldn&rsquo;t help but frown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He thought, <span style="font-style: italic;">If I can&rsquo;t find enough top-quality diamond here, I don&rsquo;t know what to do.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne said to Alison, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go over there and look at the half-gambled material.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There were more people in this area. Many of them were holding flashlights and observing the raw stones constantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia and Wesley were also here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Next to them, there was a bucket-sized piece of diamond with a palm-sized polish on it. People could see that the diamond inside had a delicate texture and a rich color. Its color was incomparably close to Imperial Green.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The price of this rough stone was as high as 15 million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this time, many bosses in Mayby City were gathering around Wesley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Mr. Ashford, do you really want to cut this rough stone?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I have been eyeing this rough stone for a long time. I think there must be good stuff inside. Look at the color. It keeps spreading inside. Maybe it&rsquo;s all Imperial Green.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Mr. Ashford, you are really generous. You actually want to cut the material worth 15 million dollars.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Thank you for giving us an opportunity to admire it.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Once this raw stone is cut open, there&rsquo;s a high probability its price could rise to over a hundred million dollars. Even in the worst case, any loss would likely be minimal.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity that I can&rsquo;t afford 15 million dollars.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Mr. Ashford, good for you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There were so many people complimenting Wesley. He was filled with pride and satisfaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I am going to cut it now. I also think that this rough stone will increase in value. But the reason I cut it is that I want to make a set of jewelry by myself and give it to my fianc&eacute;e. So, no matter what is cut out of it, even if it&rsquo;s a whole piece of Imperial Green, I will use it all to make jewelry and give it to you, Ophelia.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Wesley finished speaking, Ophelia was moved. &ldquo;Thank you, Wesley.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley smiled and immediately ordered people to lift the raw stone onto the cutting machine. He was ready to cut it on the spot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne and Alison arrived just then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley looked at the two of them. When he saw that they had only chosen six pieces of raw materials with a total price of no more than 100,000 dollars, he couldn&rsquo;t help but burst out laughing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Osborne, Alison, are you here to pick up trash? You actually picked out the raw materials that only worth a hundred thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley&rsquo;s laughter attracted everyone&rsquo;s attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They couldn&rsquo;t help laughing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I might as well give you one hundred thousand dollars,&rdquo; Wesley said disdainfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison became furious and was about to speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne held her back and said to Wesley with a smile, &ldquo;Mr. Ashford, are you going to give us these raw stones? Please sign the contract, or I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll regret it.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Osborne finished speaking, Wesley was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley wanted to humiliate Osborne. But he didn&rsquo;t expect Osborne to agree and even asked him to sign the contract.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley wondered, <span style="font-style: italic;">I don&rsquo;t care about the raw stone worth only one hundred thousand dollars. To me, the raw stones in the entire raw stone casino are just a pile of garbage.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He sneered, &ldquo;You really want me to give it to you? Well, since you have asked, how can I not agree? After all, even if a beggar reaches out to me, I will give them to him.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After saying that, Wesley actually signed a contract with Luna Jewelry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna Jewelry acquired these six pieces of raw stones without spending a penny.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison looked unhappy. She thought, <span style="font-style: italic;">Osborne shouldn&rsquo;t do this. Wesley was obviously deliberately humiliating us. How could Osborne accept them? That&rsquo;s a humiliation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne smiled and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. Just wait to see Wesley regret. Let someone cut these rough stones. I&rsquo;ll go pick a few more.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After saying that, Osborne looked at the rough stone that Wesley had chosen, which was priced at 15 million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, his expression became extremely strange.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne couldn&rsquo;t help but point at the rough stone and say, &ldquo;This rough stone costs 15 million dollars?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley suddenly looked proud.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He said disdainfully, &ldquo;You useless piece of shit. You can&rsquo;t understand. You better look at those raw stones worth thousands of dollars. Such top-quality raw stones are not something that people like you can afford.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne couldn&rsquo;t help laughing.</p><div class="pagination">
