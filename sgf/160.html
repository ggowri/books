  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massive vines tightened around Donna's body and neck like a constricting python. As Hammond pulled them tighter, her face turned a purplish-blue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna felt herself suffocating, the cold grip of death closing in. She was helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Personal Guards and Bodyguard Units were struggling against the werewolves, facing injuries and fatalities at every moment. They were unable to save her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn was barely holding on, and his situation was critical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Clarissa possessed three types of powers, none were offensive, rendering her almost powerless in this dire moment. Her eyes brimmed with tears as she watched the scene unfold, her face marked by sorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" Clarissa suddenly screamed, her eyes turning blood-red. "Let them go, and I'll go with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hammond sneered, controlling the vines around Donna while mocking, "Ms. Radcliffe, you have no right to negotiate. Once I finish them off, you're coming with us regardless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa clenched her fists tightly. Despair filled her eyes as she realized her own inadequacy. Despite having three types of powers, none could be used to attack, making her utterly useless in the current situation. Her capture had prevented Donna and the others from escaping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa loathed her own powerlessness. Her eyes burned with frustration and helplessness. All she could do was pray for a miracle, hoping someone would come to their rescue. She watched helplessly as Donna, Barlyn, and the others edged closer to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna couldn't hold on any longer. The suffocating grip made her lungs feel as though they were on fire. Her vision began to fade to black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boom!" Suddenly, a deafening thunderclap rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A blinding flash of lightning tore through the sky, striking the massive vine squarely, which coiled around Donna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying lightning shredded the giant vine effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was startled by the sudden appearance of the lightning. Instinctively, they looked up at the sky, where more lightning was gathering before crashing down with tremendous force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boom, boom, boom!" Terrifying thunder rumbled as lightning bolts struck Hammond's green vines, charring and disintegrating them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lightning hit Harland, and despite being a Class C+ martial artist, he screamed in pain, and blackened wounds appeared where he was struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lightning also struck the werewolves, setting their fur ablaze and leaving them paralyzed, black smoke pouring from their mouths and noses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those still standing were stunned. They all knew that only one person could control such lightning, and that was Raymond. But had Raymond mistakenly attacked his own allies?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden onslaught of lightning dramatically altered the battle situation. Every bolt seemed to have its own mind, avoiding the Radcliffes entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell is going on?" Hammond roared. "Raymond, have you lost your mind? Where are you aiming? Have you betrayed the King of the Aberrants?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he shouted, silence fell around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna, who had thought she was about to be strangled to death, was suddenly saved by a bolt of lightning. She, too, was bewildered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was scanning the area, trying to locate Raymond and understand why he was aiding the Radcliffe family. But no one found him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unnoticed, a ghostly figure appeared behind Harris.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Osborne who had hurried to the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the one responsible for the lightning attack. Relieved to see Clarissa still alive, Osborne's eyes filled with fury as he saw Harris holding a gun to her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harris, it's you! If you want to die, I'll grant your wish!" In an instant, Osborne moved silently, appearing behind Harris and grabbing his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris never expected an attack from behind. Before he could react, Osborne had already twisted his arm into an unnatural angle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" A blood-curdling scream erupted from Harris. He was tough, and despite the pain, he managed to pull out a gun with his other hand and attempt to shoot behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately for him, Osborne was faster. Before Harris could raise his arm, Osborne seized it, breaking it swiftly, then delivered a powerful kick to Harris' chest, collapsing it inward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris looked at Osborne in disbelief, blood gushing from his mouth. Whether he would survive or not, he was already finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted, then turned to Clarissa, his face filled with concern. "Clarissa, are you alright?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was in shock. She stared at Osborne, tears streaming down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments ago, she had been praying for someone to save them and change their dire situation. And then, Osborne appeared like a savior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rescued her again and many others in the Radcliffe family from the brink of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Clarissa felt her heart move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head vigorously, then threw herself into Osborne's arms, hugging him tightly. "Osborne, I knew you'd come to save me!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
