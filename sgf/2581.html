  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the tenth rank in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, Mason indeed had strength. At least, he was the only ordinary contestant capable of unleashing the power of the Legendary Sacred Artifact with his own strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, this excludes Osborne, Clara, and Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is actually quite remarkable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although the Legendary Sacred Artifact is powerful, if a warrior isn't strong enough, they simply can't wield it. Forcing it would immediately cause backlash, which is extremely dangerous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For example, once during the city duel, Leroy couldn't fully control the Inferno Drake Lance, an Inferior Sacred Artifact. Due to insufficient affinity, while forcing its use, she suffered backlash from the Inferno Drake Lance and almost ended up crippled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, she couldn't even fully wield an Inferior Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, among warriors of the same cultivation level, Leroy was already very powerful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, she was the top favorite to win the city duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For an ordinary Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King, being able to wield an Inferior Sacred Artifact is already impressive. If he can wield a Mid-grade Sacred Artifact, he could at least stand out in the state duel and advance to the zone duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If a warrior can wield a Superior Sacred Artifact without suffering backlash, standing out in the zone duel would be incredibly easy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the hundred ordinary contestants from the ten regions of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, apart from Osborne, Clara, and Leroy, only Mason could wield a Legendary Sacred Artifact without suffering backlash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others couldn't do it!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This explains why Mason ranks tenth in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Mason was utterly enraged, wielding the Legendary Sacred Artifact and unleashing his power madly, looking as if he was determined to fight Clara to the death and kill her on the arena.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In such a situation, Clara's expression grew serious. She humiliated Mason to vent Osborne's anger, but that didn't mean she was arrogant or conceited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew very well that if she wanted to use a quasi-Sacred Artifact to fight Mason's Legendary Sacred Artifact and defeat him, she needed to be extremely cautious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, a quasi-Sacred Artifact was no better than bare hands.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Clara's strength, the power she unleashed barehanded already surpassed what a quasi-Sacred Artifact could withstand. This quasi-Sacred Artifact wouldn't enhance her abilities; instead, it would limit her power outburst.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, if her power erupted too fiercely, it could easily shatter the quasi-Sacred Artifact first.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Clara had to put in some effort to ensure that the quasi-Sacred Artifact chain wouldn't be directly blown apart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This greatly limited her explosive power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, Clara never relied on explosive power to fight enemies. What she excelled at was using the iron chain to entangle her foes, which didn't require immense bursts of strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was also the fundamental reason why she dared to use the quasi-Sacred Artifact to humiliate Mason.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Clara let out a cold snort and swiftly launched an attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She swiftly twisted the quasi-Sacred Artifact chain, snapping it taut. Enveloped in her Sacred Power, it turned into a sharp spear, fiercely striking against Mason's attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She seized the weakness in his attack and gradually dismantled it!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The tip of her iron chain collided with Mason's attack, producing a loud bang that shattered his powerful strike.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He panicked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "How could my full-force attack be shattered like this? I clearly felt Clara didn&rsquo;t unleash overwhelming power."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Did she exploit the weakness in my attack?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mason instantly grasped the key point, his expression growing darker. Fortunately, at that moment, he suddenly heard Clara's quasi-Sacred Artifact Chain making cracking sounds, as if it couldn't withstand such immense power and was about to break.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt delighted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara's quasi-Sacred Artifact Chain couldn't withstand such a clash of power and was about to break!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mason laughed, "When your chain breaks, let's see what you'll do. Didn't you say I don't deserve to make you use the Legendary Sacred Artifact? I'll break your quasi-Sacred Artifact Chain first and force you to bring out the Legendary Sacred Artifact Chain!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His gaze was icy as he launched another attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara said, "You're celebrating too soon!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her quasi-Sacred Artifact Chain made cracking sounds, but it ultimately didn't break.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everything was within Clara's calculations.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before her chain shattered, it pierced through Mason's attack again and swiftly struck toward him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His whole body tensed, and he clenched his teeth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It still hasn't broken?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I want to see how long it can last!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Mason ignored Clara entirely, attacking her chain frantically, as if breaking this quasi-Sacred Artifact Chain would guarantee his victory.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Facing this situation, Clara showed a radiant smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mason had lost his composure!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara moved quickly. Then, her previously straight, spear-like chain transformed, becoming flexible. It was like a living serpent, dodging Mason's attacks and spiraling continuously around his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dominating Coil!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, Clara found Mason's flaw. Her quasi-Sacred Artifact Chain vanished into the void in an instant, then reappeared beside him, swiftly piercing through his Sacred Power Defense and wrapping tightly around his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, it tightened around him!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He panicked, then felt furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You want to bind me? Dream on!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mason began unleashing his power wildly, trying to shatter Clara's quasi-Sacred Artifact Chain. In his eyes, it was merely a quasi-Sacred Artifact, unworthy of affecting him. With his strength, he could easily break it apart!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, it indeed emitted a cracking sound, as if it was truly about to break.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mason felt overjoyed once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Clara remained calm and said, "You're controlled by my Dominating Coil, yet you still want to break free? You're dreaming!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, a unique power emanated from her chain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This power wasn't violent but gentle, yet it instantly suppressed Mason's wild strength, leaving him unable to unleash his power anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He showed a shocked expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, below the arena, Osborne couldn't help but smile. Clara's Dominating Coil was her ultimate move. It was a unique combat skill. According to her, it was passed down through generations. Once she used it, her chain could traverse dimensional voids and possess immense suppressive power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back in the city duel, Osborne was also restrained by Clara's Dominating Coil and couldn't break free.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, he broke free of the restraints by wearing her down in a battle of attrition, exhausting her Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Mason doesn't have that ability!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, when Clara's chain got close and he was bound by the Dominating Coil, his defeat was already sealed, leaving him no chance to struggle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He lost!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You lost!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Clara added, "With your level of skill, you think you can teach Osborne a lesson in the ring? How ridiculous! You&rsquo;re just lucky you didn&rsquo;t face him. Otherwise, you&rsquo;d lose even worse!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her words made Mason even angrier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, at this moment, he was tightly bound by her chain, completely suppressing his strength. No matter how she humiliated him, he couldn&rsquo;t fight back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, he completely lost face!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In front of so many prominent figures, Mason was defeated by Clara using a quasi-Sacred Artifact. Perhaps soon, his name would become a joke, spreading throughout the entire Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he wanted to kill her!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he could only lower his head, hiding his anger and killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Clara wins, advances to the top ten!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Match two: Leroy versus Princess Yvonne!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Please step onto the stage!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
