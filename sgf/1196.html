  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Anastasia and Zoe didn't press the issue any further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They both knew that in the face of a godlike warrior, their presence would only serve as a liability to Osborne&mdash;they couldn't lend a hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, both of them ardently wished for the day when they could break through to godhood themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia bit her lip, her voice firm. "Alright! Osborne, you need to be cautious. If things get dicey, retreat immediately! Facing a Dark Deity is no solo mission; don't try to play the hero."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understand," Osborne replied, acknowledging their concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to lead Anastasia and Zoe back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Osborne called, lifting his voice to relay his orders, "Listen up, Blood Demon members! Everyone, exit the tunnels right now and head to the surface to guard the exit. If a Dark Exotic Beast shows up, don't hold back&mdash;take it down without mercy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his orders given, Osborne was now set on venturing alone into the lair of the Dark Exotic Beasts. Inside awaited not only around ten thousand of these monsters but also an unknown Dark Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was bound to be a fierce battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne worried that the intensity of the fight could cause the underground cave to collapse completely, hence his decision to get the Blood Demon members out of there and wait above ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With everything arranged, he took a deep breath and returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, he stood at the mouth of the Dark Exotic Beast nest. However, he moved within a parallel space, making him undetectable to the creatures inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, Dark Exotic Beasts crawled out of their cocoons. They let out piercing roars toward the enormous central cocoon, seemingly paying homage, before grouping up and flying toward the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't rush to strike; he didn't see the need to stop them from leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Demon members were stationed at the entrance, ensuring that these beasts wouldn't escape unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He made his way toward the massive pod, and his heart raced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The greatest threat lurked within that cocoon&mdash;the Dark Deity. If Osborne could take care of it first, the remaining ten thousand Dark Exotic Beasts would be mere footnotes in his victory; he was confident he could handle them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time for a sneak attack," he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using his Phantom Steps, Osborne swiftly closed the distance to the colossal cocoon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It pulsed rhythmically, like a heartbeat, still completely oblivious to his approach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but feel satisfaction wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Phantom Steps&mdash;so much better than the Eityreia Organization's Stealth Arts! Perfect for ambushes and assassinations. Now, let me finish you off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took aim, positioning himself directly below the titanic cocoon, which towered over him at more than three hundred feet. Just as Osborne struck, an immense force surged within him like a tidal wave crashing against the cocoon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne unleashed a devastating punch, bursting forth from the parallel space, his fist imbued with tremendous power as it collided with the enormous cocoon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't just a casual fling; he poured all his strength into that punch. Though he hadn't invoked the Breath of Celestial for an extra boost, Osborne unleashed everything he had&mdash;this was his full might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It packed more of a punch than the blow he had struck while shattering Cain's fragmented soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne believed that this one powerful strike would obliterate the enormous cocoon and annihilate the Dark Deity inside, leaving nothing but a void in its wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the outcome left him dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His punch slammed into the massive cocoon, and instead of shattering it, the cocoon simply swayed slightly, a radiant glow shimmering along its surface. In an astonishing turn of events, it absorbed Osborne's entire strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only had he failed to eliminate the Dark Deity, but he hadn't even succeeded in breaching the cocoon's defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way!" Osborne gasped, his eyes widening in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his current prowess, a single punch could level an entire mountain, reducing whatever stood before him&mdash;be it hard rock or metal&mdash;to dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, here Osborne was, his fist halted by a colossal cocoon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A buzzing sound filled the air as Osborne's attack ignited chaos throughout the Dark Exotic Beast lair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The countless cocoons dangling from the walls began to quake violently. One by one, the beasts within emerged, their crimson eyes fixed on Osborne with a seething mix of fury and murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, the massive cocoon housed their king.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's assault on their leader had roused them all. With snarls and growls, the Dark Exotic Beasts slithered out of their cocoons, intent on eliminating the intruder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face hardened with grim resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He muttered under his breath, his earlier plan of a stealth takedown now shattered, "What the hell is this cocoon made of? It's tougher than I ever imagined. Guess we're doing this the hard way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he whispered his decision, Osborne's eyes glinted with chilling resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over 10 thousand Dark Exotic Beasts, now fully emerged from their cocoons, charged at him in a frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold snarl, Osborne activated his dark power. "Nightshade Wings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His back suddenly sprouted a pair of enormous, pitch-black wings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Abyssal Spiral!" he roared, and in the heart of the oncoming horde, an ominous vortex began to form.</span></p><div class="pagination">
