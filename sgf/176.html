  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judith looked at the sullen Valentin and asked, "Mr. Gibson, what did you say? What did I do wrong? Why are you firing me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin sneered, "I'm the general manager of Skyefall Security. As for what you did wrong, think about it yourself. Anyway, less talk, get lost now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judith's face turned red, her fists clenched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone else was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't expect Osborne's words to come true so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "Judith got fired? Can Osborne really predict the future?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna, Barlyn, and Clarissa looked at Osborne in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne just smiled and said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judith angrily said, "Valentin, you're going too far. For years, I've worked diligently at Skyefall Security, contributing greatly. I recruited half of the personnel here. If you fire me, I'll take them and go to another security company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin's expression changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at Osborne and insisted, "Judith, you dare threaten me? Fine, take them and leave. Skyefall Security won't go bankrupt without you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Valentin's resolute attitude, Judith knew nothing she could do and gradually calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sneered, "Valentin, you've lost your mind. Fine, I'm leaving. Anyway, Skyefall Security won't last long. I've been wanting to jump ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You rejected Mr. Chevalier, then the Chevalier family will definitely squeeze Skyefall Security. It's not far from bankruptcy and closure. You won't be smug for long. Next time we meet, I'll make you beg me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judith said viciously and turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin snorted coldly and didn't stop her. Osborne saw the unease and seriousness in Valentin's heart, but Valentin hid it well. After Judith left, Valentin smiled and said, "Sorry for her rudeness earlier. Let's talk in my office."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna and the others exchanged glances and looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded with a smile. "No need for that. Our goal is to rent the Class A defense system at a price of 500 million dollars per year, which I think is very reasonable. What do you think, Mr. Gibson?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna frantically gave Osborne signals to be less direct.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "How can he negotiate like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this isn't even the right place for business talks. This is a deal worth 500 million dollars a year, a deal even Sir Radcliffe couldn't close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We should at least find a more formal place and discuss it slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he just blurted it out. How could Valentin agree?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna felt Osborne knew nothing and was just messing around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Valentin immediately nodded. "No problem. Five hundred million dollars is a fair price. If possible, let's sign the contract right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Donna was instantly dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't believe her eyes and thought, "Did it really succeed? Valentin agreed? Why would he? Valentin even rejected Apollo and Sir Radcliffe. Osborne casually mentioned it, and Valentin agreed. He didn't even haggle over the price or consult Skyefall Security's new owner. What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa and Barlyn were also stunned, unable to believe what they heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gibson, you agreed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna asked uncertainly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin looked puzzled at her and calmly said, "Isn't it clear enough? Or did you change your mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna quickly shook her head. "No, we haven't. We can sign the contract right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna was afraid Valentin would regret it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the Radcliffe family, 500 million dollars wasn't much. Clarissa's safety was the priority. As long as they could rent the Class A defense system, Clarissa's safety would be ensured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if it cost more, she would agree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin smiled, "Then I'll have the contract prepared immediately. After signing, I'll personally take people to install and debug it, ensuring everything is perfect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, thank you," Donna said excitedly. Even after signing the contract, Donna still felt unreal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Even Sir Radcliffe couldn't close this deal, and we did it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be precise, Osborne did it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne casually proposed cooperation and succeeded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isn't it too easy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the bet, she couldn't stop Osborne from pursuing Clarissa and had to facilitate it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Donna felt a headache coming on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Forget it. Since Osborne isn't afraid of death, let him be. When Apollo finds out his intentions, he definitely won't let him off. I hope he survives."</span></p><div class="pagination">
