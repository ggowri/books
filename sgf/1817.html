  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After wrapping up all his affairs, Osborne finally set off from Wild Flame City, ready to make his way to the West Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celestara was vast, and the distance between the East Zone and the West Zone was nothing short of monumental.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Osborne, the distance was no longer a significant obstacle. His spatial elemental essence had reached the pinnacle of Level Eight, allowing him to perform interdimensional travel over a staggering 600 million miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the over three billion miles separating the East Zone from the West Zone, it would merely take him five hundred uses of interdimensional travel. If his divine power ran low, he could always rely on the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity for a boost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, if he wanted to, Osborne could cross that immense distance in just a few minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he chose a different route, traveling via the Supreme Malevolence Airship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For one, he wasn't in a rush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The airship could reach speeds exceeding 600 thousand miles per hour. Even if it traveled 15 million miles a day, it would only take about two hundred days to cover the three billion miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two hundred days might seem long, but Osborne had time power on his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could apply a hundredfold time acceleration to the airship, boosting its speed dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that if the Supreme Malevolence Airship operated at full throttle, it could reach the West Zone in just two days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, using the airship would ensure greater safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was still unfamiliar with Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While interdimensional travel might seem quick, he could easily end up in a perilous situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What if he accidentally transported himself into a deadly trap or stumbled upon a powerful Deathborn nest?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last thing he wanted was to find himself deep in the heart of a divine peak, a place he knew was fraught with danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne vividly recalled the Shadow Terror Fiend and the root creatures he had encountered in the depths of Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the sake of safety, Osborne decided to take the Supreme Malevolence Airship to the West Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It might be a slower journey, but at least he wouldn't be barreling headfirst into danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get this show on the road!" he declared, stepping away from Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he was clear of the city limits, he retrieved the Supreme Malevolence Airship and embedded a Celestial Crystal into its energy core. Instantly, the airship surged forward at an incredible speed toward the west.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne activated the hundredfold time acceleration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The airship seemed to enter a time tunnel, racing forward at a breathtaking pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing on the deck, he watched the scenery rush by, excitement bubbling within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"West Zone of Celestara! Here I come!" he murmured, not wasting the next two days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he navigated, he also began to train.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Currently, Osborne had reached the early pinnacle stage of the Deity King realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To break into the mid-stage, he needed vast amounts of energy, but Osborne wasn't in a hurry. His Infinite Devouring Eyes, now in Hope Haven, were continuously converting the pure energy absorbed from the root he had devoured, helping him advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne estimated that by the time they reached the West Zone, he would be ready to break through to the mid-stage of the Deity King realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he needed most now was to enhance his elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, once his elemental essence hit the peak of Level Eight, further improvement became incredibly challenging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thousands of Miracle Elixirs he had obtained from Divine Peak Nine, especially those blue ones that could boost elemental essence, were all gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, his current training yielded minimal results.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe I need to hunt down another divine peak to gather more Miracle Elixirs," Osborne mused to himself, considering his options.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he sighed, shaking off the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No point in worrying about that now. Better to see what's going on once I reach the West Zone. I wonder how things are shaping up over there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the West Zone was under the control of the Human Community, it was a patchwork of different factions, each with its own agenda. Unfortunately, some of these factions had likely betrayed the Human Community, throwing their lot in with Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How powerful is Lord Malevolence?! He's got the backing of various races, making him an overwhelming force that the Human Community can't compete with," Osborne thought, a grim realization settling in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Lord Malevolence's injuries sustained above the divine peak and the attention pulled by the peak itself, the Human Community might have already crumbled under pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pessimism and despair many factions within the Human Community felt were all too understandable. Faced with seemingly insurmountable odds and no hope for victory, it was no wonder that some chose to submit and ally themselves with Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Let's hope the situation isn't too dire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The true leader in the West Zone is the God of Light, who resides in the Sanctum of Light. If I have the chance, I'd love to pay her a visit. I can only imagine how strong someone like the God of Light is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't shake the thought of Hubery, who had reached the peak of the Deity King realm. It seemed reasonable to assume he had hit the upper limits of that level. Yet, the God of Light clearly surpassed him by a significant margin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it possible that there are hidden tiers even beyond the peak of Deity King?" Osborne pondered, grappling with the mysteries still hidden within these realms.</span></p><div class="pagination">
