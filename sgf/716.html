  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Dylan and Eugen finally regained consciousness, the battle had already come to an end. They were blissfully unaware of the fierce clash between Osborne and Luca, Duke Medusa, and the other Evolved Humans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All they knew was that Osborne and Clarissa had saved them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the details of what had transpired, the ferocity of the fight, remained a mystery to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca and Duke Medusa were both Class AAA, far beyond Dylan and Eugen's capabilities. They had been knocked out in an instant, completely oblivious to the strength of their assailants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, witnessing Osborne cleave the ocean with a single swing of the axe, creating a trench nearly a thousand yards long, a hundred yards wide, and several hundred yards deep, they finally grasped the magnitude of his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock and fear filled their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, they had looked down on Osborne, convinced he was unworthy of Clarissa. They had even insulted him and opposed their union.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they couldn't shake the worry that Osborne might seek revenge for their past transgressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But their fears were unfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa stepped up beside Osborne, taking his hand in hers. She tilted her head slightly, gazing at his handsome face, her expression radiating happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, Dad, Aunt Donna, I promise you, the Radcliffe family will not fall! We will rebuild, and Osborne and I will help you every step of the way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled at her words and nodded at the four of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What Clarissa said goes for me, too. Whatever you need to rebuild the Radcliffe family, just ask. I'll do everything I can to help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Radcliffe family had suffered at the hands of the Aberrants largely because of him. He couldn't just stand by and do nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, the fear on Dylan and Eugen's faces began to fade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged glances, and a deep sigh escaped their lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I owe you an apology. We said some terrible things to you, and we tried to keep you away from Clarissa. Thank you for not holding it against us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugen chimed in, "We've come to realize it wasn't that you weren't good enough for Clarissa; it was that we were blind! Just recently, you warned us to evacuate Skyefall, and we ignored you because of our prejudice. That's what led to this disaster for the Radcliffe family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we had listened to you, none of this would have happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all my fault! I should have known better!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugen's eyes glistened with tears as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan shook his head, his own expression filled with self-reproach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's not just you. I'm the head of the Radcliffe family. I'm the one who ordered us to stay put. It's my fault!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Dylan knelt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've failed the Radcliffe family! I've let down every single member! I don't deserve to be the head anymore!" After he finished speaking, he kowtowed in the direction of the Radcliffe Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Donna, Barlyn, and Clarissa were all teary-eyed, feeling the weight of their shared grief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, would you consider becoming the head of the Radcliffe family?" Dylan suddenly asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's eyes widened in panic. "Dad, how can I? I'm a Fatebearer! Didn't that person say I must stay away from the Radcliffe family for its Fate to be secure?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan bit his lip, and frustration was evident in his voice. "Fate?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What does that even matter now? Fate is meant to be changed! Look at what's happened to the Radcliffe family. Can it really get any worse? We're down to just us now! If you don't step up as the head, who will?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's anxiety deepened as she glanced at Barlyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barlyn is still here! Let him take the lead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn let out a wry smile upon hearing this. "Clarissa, don't kid yourself. I'm just a Class C metahuman. My talents only go so far. Do you really think I could become the head of the family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was momentarily taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan, Eugen, and Donna immediately began urging Clarissa to take up the role of the Radcliffe family's head. They insisted that only she had the capability to save and rebuild the Radcliffe family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stayed silent, feeling it wasn't his place to interfere in family matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, after much persuasion from everyone, Clarissa agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll temporarily take on the role of the Radcliffe family's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But once the family is rebuilt and back on its feet, I'll step down. I just want to be by Osborne's side. Is that okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan and Eugen exchanged glances and nodded in agreement. "Alright."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Clarissa became the head of the Radcliffe family. Osborne could see the added weight of responsibility on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa bit her lip, saying, "Osborne, I want to return to the Radcliffe Estate first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The bodies of the Radcliffe family members still haven't been laid to rest. I need to go back and arrange their funeral."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded in understanding. "Alright, go ahead. I'll wait until Emma's breakthrough, and then I'll join you to help with the arrangements."</span></p><div class="pagination">
