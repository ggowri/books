  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, through his Satan's Eye, saw countless Ice Beetles gathering in the distance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The number was simply overwhelming!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could see at least over a million Ice Beetles, and there might be even more beyond his sight.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, they were gradually entering a cave, but the cave's entrance was small, unable to let too many Ice Beetles in quickly, leaving over a million stuck outside, waiting to enter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What shocked Osborne was that the cave was extremely peculiar. His Satan's Eye couldn't see inside the cave at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An invisible force was blocking Satan's Eye from peering inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This left Osborne quite puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Indeed, there were things capable of blocking Satan's Eye, such as the Warfare Mist of the Warfare Ancient Tree and the protective mist of the Astralwreck Dragon Egg...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's Satan's Eye couldn't see through them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But such things were extremely rare. After all, his Satan's Eye had already reached the Sacredness Level, making it incredibly powerful. Avoiding its gaze was extremely difficult.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And this cave could actually block the gaze of his Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This cave is strange!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't rush over. In his sight, there were over a million Ice Beetles. If they charged forward, he could easily deal with them using the power of Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, that strange cave made Osborne a bit fearful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't understand the situation in the cave, so he didn't dare to act rashly. After all, these Ice Beetles chose to gather here for refuge, surely because something here could protect them from harm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne feared that acting rashly might put him in danger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought for a moment, then started communicating with Primordial in his mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He explained the situation to Primordial, but Primordial also showed a confused expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, this cosmos is too vast. There are so many wondrous things and incredible abilities. As an offshoot of the World Tree, while I can share some knowledge with other offshoots, it's impossible for me to know everything!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There are too many things in this cosmos that can block your Satan's Eye from peeping! With the information you currently have, I can't analyze it at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I suggest you go in and take a look yourself!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"These Ice Beetles aren't very intelligent, but they all chose to take refuge here. It must be because something inside can protect them and intimidate the Magma Devourer!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And that thing is likely not a living being, maybe a treasure!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Primordial finished speaking, Osborne was somewhat convinced.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Then should I go into the cave and take a look?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since I'm already here, I really should take a look! Besides, a large number of Ice Beetles are hiding in this cave. If I don't find a way to take them all out, it would be such a waste!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In that case..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne made a decision.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Clara, Leroy, stay here. I'm going ahead to scout! Be careful. More Ice Beetles will come one after another. Make sure they don't spot you. Otherwise, with your strength, you won't stand a chance against them&mdash;certain death!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Clara and Leroy exchanged a glance and nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry. We'll be careful! No matter what happens, we'll stay hidden and won't act recklessly! But you..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were a bit worried.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and patted Flash's head. "Don't worry. With Flash by my side, nothing will go wrong! No matter how many Ice Beetles show up, dealing with them is a piece of cake for Flash!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't tell Clara and Leroy about the mysterious cave, fearing they might worry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, we'll wait for you here!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said goodbye to them and quickly approached the cave with Flash. By now, the millions of Ice Beetles that had been outside the cave had all moved deep inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But every now and then, new Ice Beetles would appear, entering the cave one after another as if on a pilgrimage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne seized an opportunity and dashed forward with Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It felt like passing through a curtain of water, and he was already inside the cave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he showed a surprised expression again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After passing through the narrow entrance, it felt like they had entered another world. It was still covered in snow and ice, but everywhere bloomed transparent flowers resembling ice crystals, with shimmering light flowing on the petals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those flowers, petal after petal, stretched endlessly, making the whole world look stunning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "This is actually a stable Dimensional Microcosm! Who created such a massive Dimensional Microcosm? Even with my current abilities, I can't achieve this!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Also, are these </span><span>all Ethereal</span><span> Blooms?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The quantity is actually this vast."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt utterly amazed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He never expected that the seemingly ordinary cave would have such a unique interior, hiding a snow-covered Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is quite similar to the Hope Haven Osborne created back then.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's just that this place is larger, more stable, and filled with denser spiritual energy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just the sheer number of Ethereal Blooms alone is an immense resource and wealth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because Ethereal Bloom is also on the list.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One Ethereal Bloom can be exchanged for a thousand Kingdom Duel Scorepoints. While its value isn't extremely high, it's definitely not low either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The important thing is that the Ethereal Blooms here are like wild grass, everywhere. What Osborne can see probably numbers in the millions, even tens of millions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "If they were all exchanged for Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, how much would that be?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't help but get excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Flash looked at the countless Ethereal Blooms, incredibly excited. He rushed over, devouring them in big bites, utterly satisfied, frolicking among the flowers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "Flash likes eating Ethereal Blooms?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt quite surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his understanding, Flash, the Astralwreck Dragon, should prefer eating various minerals, even the cores of stars...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As it turns out, Flash's taste seems quite unique.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He likes eating vegetarian.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He eats Beast Soul Flower, after all, it's something the Beast Clan loves. For the Beast Clan, Beast Soul Flower has a powerful enhancement effect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Flash also likes Ethereal Bloom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "After Flash transformed into the shape of a warhorse, did even his appetite and preferences change? He likes eating all kinds of flowers and plants now, but that's actually a good thing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, if Flash liked eating various minerals or even star cores, I wouldn't be able to get those for him! There are so many Ethereal Blooms here. If I gather them all, it'll be enough for Flash to eat for a long time!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I could even take this entire Dimensional Microcosm with me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt delighted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But before that, I need to figure out what's going on in this Dimensional Microcosm! I hope it belongs to no one. If it has an owner, that would be troublesome..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Osborne looked around.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, he noticed numerous Ice Beetles. At this moment, they were linked head to tail, gathering together and heading deeper into the small world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Osborne sensed a strange aura there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, he also heard sounds resembling war drums.</span></p><div class="pagination">
