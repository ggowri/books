  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden appearance of Osborne on the battlefield took everyone by surprise. In the blink of an eye, he seriously injured Eliot, the leader of Lord League, capturing him and leaving the onlookers in stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Eliot was taken, panic surged through Lord League's ranks. Instantly, their attack on the Prophet Alliance came to a halt as they scrambled to encircle Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Let our leader go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Release him, or you'll meet a fate worse than death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Lord League members shouted furiously at Osborne, but the sight of him gripping Eliot tightly made them hesitate, unsure of their next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Eddie from the Prophet Alliance stood in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather! You are here?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie was bewildered. They had less than twenty warriors facing the overwhelming odds of over sixty from Lord League, and just as it seemed they were about to be wiped out, Osborne appeared like a beacon of hope, seizing Eliot and temporarily turning the tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I came to your rescue, of course," Osborne replied with a calm smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie felt a rush of gratitude, but it was overshadowed by concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather! You shouldn't be here. As you said, the Pantheon League, </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, and now even Lord League has betrayed humanity, all bowing to the Dark Deity Legion. We're surrounded; this is a death trap! You shouldn't have shown yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained unflappable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Pike, your Prophet Alliance has faced death and still refused to betray humanity or submit to the Dark Deity Legion. How could I just stand by and watch you perish?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie surveyed the powerful figures from the Dark Deity Legion, Pantheon League, and </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization surrounding them and sighed, feeling an overwhelming sense of despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now what? We're trapped with no way out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne simply smiled, saying, "If escape isn't an option, then we eliminate the enemy! Wipe them out, and we can solve this problem for good. Blue Planet can finally find peace!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie froze, taken aback by Osborne's confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Wipe out the entire enemy force?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just Osborne and a handful of them against thousands of the Dark Deity Legion, Pantheon League, </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, and Lord League's Transcendent Deities and Superior Deities?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How are twenty of us supposed to take down a thousand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie could hardly fathom it; Osborne's words sounded like a jest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, laughter erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nelson, the leader of the Pantheon League, regarded Osborne with disdain. "</span><span>So</span><span> you're the </span><span>Rosmandi's</span><span> Godfather? Osborne from the Augustine family? You've got some nerve thinking you can take us all down! You must be joking!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nelson's face twisted into an arrogant sneer; he showed no sign of concern despite Osborne's sudden appearance and his decisive move against Eliot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, in his eyes, Osborne was just a single person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze shifted back to Eliot, who Osborne had by the throat, and he chuckled derisively. "Eliot, you really are pathetic! One blow from a mere junior, and here you are, captured alive! You're not worthy of serving Lord Malevolence. Maybe it would be better if you just died!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emperor Dare of the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization glared at Osborne, his laughter cold and mocking. "To think a young upstart like you has grown so formidable, it's quite astounding. If you were allowed to continue growing, even we old-timers would have to look up to you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you're too foolish! With your talent and mastery of spatial power, had you cloistered yourself for another few decades or even centuries, few would have been able to challenge you. Lord Malevolence himself might have faced trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yet here you are, out of your mind, charging into our trap to save a handful of useless Prophet Alliance members! Are you asking for death? Or do you really think capturing Eliot and holding him hostage will make us spare you? How laughable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Apocalypse Harbinger, Emperor Dare added, "Esteemed Apocalypse Harbinger, this man is an extraordinary talent with spatial power. If he reaches his full potential, he will undoubtedly rise to the top of the human resistance, causing us tremendous trouble. We must eliminate him, even at the cost of Eliot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At these words, Eliot, still in Osborne's grip, paled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He croaked, each word a struggle, "No! Don't sacrifice me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apocalypse Harbinger, I've pledged my allegiance to Lord Malevolence&mdash;I'm one of yours! Please, save me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apocalypse Harbinger's expression remained impassive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of disdain crossed his eyes as he glanced briefly at Eliot. "What a useless wretch," he muttered coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he fixed his icy stare on Osborne. "Submit to Lord Malevolence. Or die."</span></p><div class="pagination">
