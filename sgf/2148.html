  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massive Sanctum of Light floated majestically above the Human Alliance, a steadfast beacon of hope. Whenever the members of the alliance looked up, the sight of that sacred structure brought them comfort, a reminder that they were not alone in this fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Opposite them loomed the Ninefold Heaven's Tower, a foreboding symbol of the Dark Deity Legion, which numbered over fifty billion, standing in stark contrast to the ten billion of the Human Alliance. The two factions faced each other, separated by vast distances, both sides brimming with fighting spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Typically, this standoff would lead to a new round of border competition, a fierce contest that had been ongoing for nearly a month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, the Dark Deity Legion had dominated, crushing the Human Community's top talents. In fact, during the first two days, the Human Community suffered a humiliating record of one win and seven losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, just when the Dark Deity Legion thought they could easily overwhelm the Human Community and force them to relinquish Peaks City, the tide suddenly turned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings made their grand entrance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their assistance, the Human Community shook the Dark Deity Legion to its core, achieving an astonishing eight consecutive victories on the third day of competition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One, the commander of the Dark Deity Legion, dispatched numerous elite warriors from the Paramount Supreme Clan, but they couldn't secure a single win, ending the day with a dismal record of zero wins and eight losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That day marked a turning point; the morale of the Human Alliance, which had plummeted to the depths, soared back to life. They not only regained their confidence but also pushed back against the Dark Deity Legion, who found themselves at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zero wins and eight losses&mdash;a disgrace for the Dark Deity Legion and a humiliation for the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Seven Young Deity Kings of the Human Community emerged as heroes, with Osborne, their leader, becoming the talk of the town.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His prowess was nothing short of legendary&mdash;he had effortlessly defeated ten Ascension Four warriors from the Paramount Supreme Clan while operating at the Ascension One level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer strength he displayed left everyone in awe, including Icy One himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One realized that as long as Osborne was alive, the Human Community would remain a formidable opponent in the border competitions. Desperate to eliminate this threat, he decided to take a risk. He called upon the Eight Dark Sovereigns to launch a surprise attack on the Sanctum of Light, aiming to assassinate the Seven Young Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, they succeeded, albeit at a heavy cost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thousand Supernal Deity Kings fell in the assault, and even Icy Six, Icy Seven, and Icy Eight lost their lives within the confines of the Sanctum of Light. Yet, they managed to eliminate Osborne and two other members of the Seven Young Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One believed the sacrifice was worth it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With three of the Seven Young Deity Kings dead, including the powerful and prodigious Osborne, he thought the Human Community would no longer stand a chance in future competitions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the subsequent matches, the Human Community continued to hold their ground, consistently winning at least three out of eight contests, and sometimes even five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This resilience ensured that the Human Community remained firmly entrenched in front of Peaks City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Days turned into weeks, and despite the relentless competitions, the Dark Deity Legion struggled to force the Human Community to relinquish their hold on Peaks City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One began to sense something was amiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His patience was wearing thin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On this particular day, as the competition time approached, the Human Community had sent a thousand Transcendent Deity warriors to the arena, ready for battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the Dark Deity Legion remained eerily silent, with no one stepping forward to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>High above, the God of Light wore a grave expression as she observed the distant Ninefold Heaven's Tower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something felt off, and an unsettling tension hung in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, listen up! Prepare for war!" the God of Light declared, her voice steady yet filled with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words sent shockwaves through the ranks of the Human Community's leaders, their faces pale with the realization that a storm was brewing on the horizon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A voice trembled from the crowd. "Prepare for war?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The esteemed God of Light, are you saying that a full-scale war is about to begin? The Paramount Supreme Clan is done with the border competitions and is ready to unleash their forces?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light nodded solemnly. "It's been nearly a month. Thanks to the Hudson family, the Demon Slayer, and the efforts of the Seven Young Deity Kings, we've managed to hold our ground on the border. But this stalemate is intolerable for the Paramount Supreme Clan and the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can feel Icy One's patience wearing thin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He won't waste any more time on the border competitions; he's gearing up for war..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words sent a ripple of shock through the gathered leaders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they were the elite warriors of the Human Community, seasoned figures accustomed to power, the prospect of an all-out war drained the color from their faces, fear flickering in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A full-scale war!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could the Human Community possibly stand against the Paramount Supreme Clan? How could they hold their ground against the Dark Deity Legion?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With ten billion humans, how could they ever hope to withstand fifty billion warriors from the Dark Deity Legion?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of numbers and elite warriors, the Human Community was vastly outmatched by both the Paramount Supreme Clan and the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>War meant death&mdash;lots of it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the full-scale conflict began, the battlefield would surely run red with blood, and countless members of the Human Community would fall to the merciless onslaught of the Dark Deity Legion. The entire West Zone could face annihilation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cacophony of voices erupted as panic swept through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone suddenly shouted, "Where are the esteemed God of Night, the esteemed God of Light?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In this dire situation, only the God of Night can save us! If he can defeat Lord Malevolence, we might avoid this war!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, tell us where the God of Night is!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need the God of Night!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes turned toward the God of Light, their expressions filled with desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lip, gazing at the expectant faces surrounding her, and finally shook her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the atmosphere shifted palpably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What does this mean? Are you saying the God of Night has abandoned us? We're at the brink of extinction, and he hasn't shown himself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need the God of Night!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only he can save the Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The esteemed God of Light, please, tell us where the God of Night is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light looked at the panicking crowd and sighed heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, but I don't know where the God of Night is. He... hasn't returned. So, we can't rely on him for salvation. We must... depend on ourselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, a wave of murmurs rippled through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization that the God of Night was still absent filled many with despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without the God of Night, how could they even hope to stand against the Dark Deity Legion?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like a death sentence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Without the God of Night's protection, perhaps we should just surrender! At least if we surrender, we might survive..." someone shouted, and his words didn't provoke the outrage one might expect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, many lowered their heads, contemplating the grim reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a situation devoid of hope, maybe surrender was the only viable option left.</span></p><div class="pagination">
