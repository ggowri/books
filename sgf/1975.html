  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine chuckled, a smirk appearing on his face. "Looks like I hit the nail on the head!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really are 'Theodore'! Or should I call you something else?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged, unfazed. "Does it really matter? You're going to die here anyway! Knowing my name won't mean a thing, will it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine burst into laughter, as if he'd just heard the funniest joke in the world. "You think I'm going to die here? Do you honestly expect the God of Light to swoop in and take me out? That's downright hilarious! If I dared to show my face here, I wouldn't be afraid of her! Besides, she's too busy to bother with me right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Icy Nine exuded confidence, a smug grin etched on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's smile remained cool and collected. "No, I mean I'm the one who's going to take you down right here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine's laughter grew even louder, echoing through the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can take me out? Seriously? I'll admit, that everyone underestimated you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who knew you were hiding so much strength? Even a wounded Bram couldn't hold a candle to you! But to think you could kill me? You're way off! Not even the God of Light could take me down that easily!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes narrowed, determination flickering within. "Is that so? Well, I'm itching to give it a shot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he focused, his gaze sharpening as he contemplated the challenge ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He truly wanted to see if he could match Icy Nine's power, or even take Icy Nine down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine was one of the Nine Dark Sovereigns, the most important aides to Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he ranked at the bottom among the Nine, taking him out would certainly sting for Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, achieving that would be no walk in the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had only just ascended to the rank of Ascension One Supernal Deity King, and the gap between him and Icy Nine was vast. In a fair fight, he had no chance against Icy Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That meant he'd have to rely on some special tactics.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to try and kill me?" Icy Nine raised an eyebrow, puzzled by Osborne's confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He figured Osborne was just bluffing, but the fierce determination on Osborne's face told him otherwise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne genuinely intended to take him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "What gives him that right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of anger welled up within Icy Nine, like a tiger provoked by a mere kitten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! If you're looking for death, I'll be happy to oblige!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I came to the West Zone with a target in mind&mdash;you! You ambushed and wounded Osric, leading to his death at the hands of the Creation Herald! You caused my team to lose thirty Supernal Deity Kings! I was punished by the esteemed Lord Malevolence because of you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're dead! I'll personally send you to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Icy Nine launched his attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't think that just because you defeated Bram, you can stand up to me. The gap between us is wider than the sky and deeper than the ocean! Prepare to lose!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying force erupted from Icy Nine, resonating with the powers of heaven and earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive handprint materialized above Osborne, crashing down upon him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression hardened, but instead of dodging, he braced himself for impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground trembled violently as a massive crater, several dozen miles wide, formed where Osborne stood, perfectly shaped like a handprint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the bottom of that crater lay Osborne, struggling to rise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood-soaked and battered, he fought to lift himself off the ground, his face pale and marked with pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth, acknowledging the overwhelming power he faced. "Ascension Five Supernal Deity King... truly formidable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The power of that casual strike was more terrifying than Bram's Divine Ascendance Technique! Luckily, my defenses held up pretty well. It only left me heavily injured; killing me is another story!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He locked his gaze on Osborne, shock etched across his features. He could see it clearly&mdash;Osborne had taken his attack head-on with nothing but his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine thought, bewildered, "How is that possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even warriors of my level can't withstand my strikes like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How can this guy's body be so strong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of foreboding crept into Icy Nine's heart, and his murderous intent towards Osborne intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're definitely hiding something!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it doesn't matter&mdash;I only used a fraction of my power just now! Next, I'll unleash my full strength and wipe you out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can go straight to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Icy Nine prepared to strike, determined to give Osborne no chance of survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he was about to unleash his fury, an unexpected turn of events unfolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne fixed his gaze on Icy Nine, a cold smile creeping onto his face. "You want to kill me? I told you, you won't succeed! Instead, it's you who's going to die here today! Absolute forbidden zone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce shout, a massive blood-red lotus flower erupted behind Osborne. In an instant, it exploded, scattering power across a radius of 300 miles, tinting the area a soft crimson hue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolute forbidden zone! Restrict their power to Ascension One Supernal Deity King!" Osborne commanded, his voice firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, countless faint red lights enveloped Icy Nine, Bram, and Trevor within that area. Trevor, already an Ascension One Supernal Deity King, felt nothing out of the ordinary. But for Bram and Icy Nine, their faces turned pale in a heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They quickly realized that their powers had been inexplicably restrained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bram, originally an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King, found himself trapped at the level of an Ascension One Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of disbelief washed over him, mirrored in Icy Nine's shocked expression as he faced the same fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces paled in an instant, the gravity of the situation sinking in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine's eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible? No one can suppress my power! Whatever this is, get out of my body!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thunderous explosions erupted around Icy Nine as he fought against the restriction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could feel Icy Nine's power surging, desperately trying to break free from the effects of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity's Absolute forbidden zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was evident that the zone couldn't fully contain him; after all, Icy Nine's cultivation level was far superior to Osborne's!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a matter of moments, Icy Nine's aura shifted from Ascension One Supernal Deity King, quickly climbing to Ascension Two Supernal Deity King, then Ascension Three Supernal Deity King, and finally reaching Ascension Four Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face flushed with rage as he unleashed all his power, but even then, he could only manage to restore himself to the level of Ascension Four Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The absolute forbidden zone still held back a portion of his strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Osborne couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Thank goodness! The absolute forbidden zone is still effective! It's managed to push Icy Nine down from Ascension Five to Ascension Four!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap is still significant, but it's a fight I can take on!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
