  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The helicopter's rotor blades whirled furiously, lifting off the ground and slowly disappearing into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was gone - taken away by Dylan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had smiled as he watched her leave, but as soon as she was out of sight, his smile vanished, replaced by an icy resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This parting felt heavier than the last, and he couldn't shake the feeling of frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was his plan, yet he felt utterly powerless. If only he were strong enough, strong enough that no one could dismiss his feelings, then he wouldn't have to watch the woman he loved being taken away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne stood tall enough, who would dare to force Clarissa into anything?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the end, this is on me for not being strong enough! I'll remember this feeling of helplessness, but soon, I'll bring you back myself! Clarissa, just wait for me!" </span><span>Osborne vowed silently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned to face Donna and Barlyn, who were still at the manor, busying themselves with packing up a few things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their expressions were somber, mirroring the weight in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, are you alright?" Barlyn asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne managed a smile. "I'm fine, really. Clarissa and I are just temporarily separated. I'll be heading to Dampston soon to take down Alexander and win her back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Barlyn, you're not doubting me, are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn opened his mouth, wanting to assure Osborne of his faith, but the words stuck in his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dampston was no walk in the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the stronghold of the Paltrow family, and Alexander was a formidable opponent. How could Barlyn possibly give Osborne the confidence he was looking for?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna sighed, "Osborne, as harsh as it sounds, maybe it's time to let Clarissa go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Radcliffe family has wronged you, and if she were just a regular girl, I'd support you wholeheartedly. But she's not just anyone. She's the Fatebearer of the Radcliffe family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Her destiny has never been hers to control."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, Osborne let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Destiny not in her hands? What kind of Fatebearer is that? Everyone thinks Clarissa's fate is set in stone, but I'm willing to do whatever it takes to help her change that, to take charge of her own destiny!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that declaration, he turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fifth heir test had begun, and he needed to prepare himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to get to Dampston quickly. Clarissa was waiting for him, so he couldn't afford to waste a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna called after him, urgency in her voice, "Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't go to Dampston. This is my last piece of advice. If you do, you might not come back. You have no idea how powerful the Paltrow family is or how strong Alexander really is.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you die, Clarissa will be heartbroken."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne halted but didn't turn around. "If I don't go, Clarissa will be even more heartbroken! I'll find out just how strong the Paltrow family is when I get there. They think they can eliminate me? Not a chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he strode away from Radcliffe Manor, a place built specifically for Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that she was gone, the estate would soon fall into disrepair, and he knew he might never return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took one last, serious look around, then resolutely got into his car and drove off, determination fueling his every move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne headed straight to Luna Jewelry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alison, I need you to move fast and whip up a few pieces for me, specifically, a crown, a scabbard, and two scepters!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled four dazzling diamonds from his Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, he had absorbed five blood diamonds, leaving behind five perfect diamonds the size of a baby's fist. He used one for the Crown of Fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he brought out the remaining four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison stared at the four flawless diamonds, each identical in size, her jaw dropping in awe. But seeing Osborne's serious expression, she bit back her curiosity and held her questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, do you have any specifications?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne considered for a moment before quickly listing his requests. "Can you have them ready in three days?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alison bit her lip, looking worried. "That's a tight timeline. Jewelry of this caliber usually requires meticulous craftsmanship. But if you really need it urgently, I'll find a way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, appreciating her dedication. "I really appreciate it. Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he stood up and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, he made his way to Skyefall Security Services, where he met with Valentin. After a lengthy discussion, Osborne finally departed from the facility, a new sense of resolve driving him forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he arrived at the diamond mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three days, I hope I can find more blood diamonds! The more I gather, the faster my strength will grow, and the better I can handle the crisis with Dampston."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne then stepped into the mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before hunting for blood diamonds, Osborne decided to upgrade Satan's Eye to level five, enhancing its X-ray vision to an even more terrifying level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he set off to search for blood diamonds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For three straight days, Osborne delved into the depths of the mine, driven by a relentless focus that blurred the lines between day and night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, after three exhausting days, he emerged from the mine with a triumphant smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not bad at all!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
