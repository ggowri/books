  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as Casey finished speaking, Clara and Leroy immediately looked at Osborne, their eyes full of curiosity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had no idea when Osborne and Casey became so close.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne also seemed a bit helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, since Casey had already stayed, Osborne naturally couldn't drive her away. After all, in the Royal Treasury, Casey handed Michelle's keepsake ring to him and refused any compensation. This gesture made Osborne feel a certain fondness for her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "In that case, let's act together."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he finished speaking, Osborne's gaze had already turned toward the depths of Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After breaking through his cultivation level, all his abilities improved significantly, and his perception of the entire Celestial Spire became much clearer. But he realized that the higher his cultivation level and the stronger his power, the more terrifying the Celestial Spire appeared to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An ant facing a tiger might only see its massive size but wouldn't feel fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But a rabbit or a sheep encountering a tiger would surely tremble in fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because they truly understand the terror of a tiger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne felt exactly the same.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "The challenges of the Celestial Spire must be extremely tough! We don't understand it well for now, so let's temporarily follow Princess Seraphina and her group. I only said I wouldn't take her orders, not that I couldn't follow her."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's lips curved slightly as he continued, "The Royal Family must have already explored the Celestial Spire and are quite familiar with the early levels. We'll follow them first, figure out the specifics of the Celestial Spire, and then decide how to act on our own."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy nodded in agreement upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Casey chimed in, "Osborne, I'll follow your lead. You're the champion, so you must be right."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne glanced at her helplessly and said, "Let's go. We'll head up first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Seraphina and her group had already ventured deep into the Celestial Spire, their figures completely swallowed by the surrounding darkness. However, Osborne possessed Satan's Eye, allowing him to watch them from afar without worrying about being left behind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the first level of the Celestial Spire was utterly silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina walked at the front of the group, her expression calm and untroubled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Seraphina, what exactly is the trial on the first level of the Celestial Spire?" someone finally couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina replied, "Don't worry, you'll find out soon. This is just the first level of the Celestial Spire, it's no challenge for us! Even though we haven't reached Empyrean Sacredness, we can pass with ease."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her words made everyone breathe a little easier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Seraphina pointed ahead and said, "Found it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the dim environment, a massive beam of light suddenly appeared, illuminating an area. Within this area, there was only a pitch-black stone tablet, with nothing else around.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina's face lit up with joy. "That&rsquo;s the trial point for the first level. Once we step in, the trial will begin immediately. A group of warriors' projections will appear then. Though they haven&rsquo;t reached Empyrean Sacredness, their strength is remarkable. We just need to defeat them to move on to the second level!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll go first, you wait outside!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina led the group near the light beam and stepped into it without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Buzz!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment she stepped into the light beam, a blurry projection appeared within it&mdash;a vague human figure exuding a powerful aura.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Defeat these warriors' projections, and we can clear the first level and enter the second?" someone couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His expression was slightly peculiar, feeling that this trial seemed too simple. With their current strength, any one of them could probably easily defeat those warriors' projections.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina nodded gently. "That's right! But we must be quick! The faster we clear it, the more benefits we can gain!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She pointed to the sole stone monument within the light beam and said, "Do you see that stone monument? That's the Battle Points Monument. The better you perform in the trial, the higher your ranking on the Battle Points Monument, and the more battle points you'll earn. These points can be exchanged for various precious resources and treasures on the ninth and eighteenth levels."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone quickly turned their gaze to the Battle Points Monument.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Small characters were engraved on the Battle Points Monument.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Successfully clearing the trial grants 100 battle points!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Clearing within a hundred breaths grants 500 battle points!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Clearing within ten breaths grants 1,000 battle points!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Clearing within five breaths grants 2,000 battle points!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Clearing within three breaths grants 5,000 battle points!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Clearing within one breath grants 10,000 battle points!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone couldn't help but brighten up. "What resources or treasures can these battle points be exchanged for?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Plenty!" Seraphina said calmly, "Anything you can imagine&mdash;resources, treasures&mdash;Celestial Spire has almost everything. You can even exchange for a Supreme Sacred Artifact. However, that requires a massive amount of battle points. Unless you can clear up to the eighteenth level or higher and earn the highest battle points reward on each level, it's nearly impossible to get a Supreme Sacred Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was still thrilled after hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although it was hard for them to obtain a Supreme Sacred Artifact, even a Legendary Sacred Artifact, or other resources, treasures, or combat techniques, was enticing enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The same clearance, yet the difference in speed can make the battle points vary by a hundredfold. For the first level, if you barely pass, you only get a hundred battle points. But if you can defeat those warriors' projections within one breath and clear it smoothly, you can earn ten thousand battle points!" Everyone became very excited at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina said, "Watch closely, I'm about to start the challenge! After I clear it, you all enter one by one. Don't waste too much time, I'll wait for you on the second level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, she suddenly unleashed a force, striking the Battle Points Monument.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "When the Battle Points Monument lights up red, the timer starts, so you'd better prepare your attacks in advance before activating it. This can improve your clearance speed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Seraphina's force struck the Battle Points Monument, and instantly, it began to shine brightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, the light turned red.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment the red light appeared, those warriors' projections moved swiftly, charging toward Seraphina with astonishing speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Seraphina was even faster.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She casually unleashed a terrifying force, striking directly at those warriors' projections, shattering them instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, the red light of the Battle Points Monument disappeared, turning into green light.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina said, "The green light means I've cleared it! Now, the Battle Points Monument will calculate my time and award battle points."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, the Battle Points Monument shot out a red light, which entered Seraphina's body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, a red number appeared above Seraphina's head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ten thousand!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina defeated the warriors' projections in less than a breath, earning the highest battle points reward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ten thousand points!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And these battle points hovered above her head in the form of energy numbers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was astonished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone noticed a faint staircase appearing in front of Seraphina, stretching into the sky. At the end of the staircase was a red number: 2!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina said, "This is the staircase to the second level of the Celestial Spire! It only appears after clearing the stage."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, I'll wait for you on the second level!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't make me wait too long!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Seraphina quickly disappeared along the faint staircase from the first level of the Celestial Spire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She has already entered the second level!</span></p><div class="pagination">
