  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mere thought of every member of the Blood Demon Organization being equipped with a super energy pistol made Osborne's blood surge with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "At that point, who could stand against the Blood Demon Organization?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If every member of the Blood Demon Organization fired a shot, even a group of Class S Supreme Overlords standing in their way would be turned into sieves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Kash quickly doused Osborne's excitement with a cold reality check.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, that's not possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kash's face was filled with bitterness. "Mr. Augustine, the super energy pistol can't be mass-produced. The body of the pistol is made of the toughest Galactic Alloy, without which it wouldn't withstand such immense energy bursts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This Galactic Alloy is extremely rare. It's extracted bit by bit from countless meteorites and can't be synthesized yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With the materials we have now, we can only make ten super energy pistols at most. If we want mass production, we need to wait for a breakthrough from the materials research department.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But even if the materials research department achieves a breakthrough and we have enough Galactic Alloy, it still wouldn't be enough. The real key to the super energy pistol is the Divine Bone Crystal. It functions like the magazine of the pistol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The magazine gets consumed, and the Divine Bone Crystal is incredibly rare."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel that the energy inside the Divine Bone Crystal in his super energy pistol had already thinned out, reduced by about one-twentieth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that using the super energy pistol at full power twenty times would consume one Divine Bone Crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his current strength, Osborne could activate the super energy pistol twenty times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he reached Class AAA, he might only need a few full-power activations to exhaust a single Divine Bone Crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, in most situations, Osborne wouldn't need to use full power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless facing top-tier Class AAA warriors or Class S Supreme Overlords, a partial energy injection into the super energy pistol would suffice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calculating this way, one Divine Bone Crystal was still quite durable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, in Osborne's Dimensional Space, he had two boxes of Divine Bone Crystals containing several hundred pieces. Those would last him a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne said, "Then go ahead and make ten for me! I'll arrange for someone to collect more Divine Bone Crystals, and you should push the materials research department to focus on Galactic Alloy development.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the research on Galactic Alloy succeeds, they could be used to build combat drones or battle robots, which would also make formidable weapons! At that point, even Class AAA opponents might find it hard to destroy them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Kash nodded resolutely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Mr. Augustine. We'll work around the clock to achieve a breakthrough as soon as possible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "No need to go without sleep. Rest is important too. You're all the backbone of the research institute, and I don't want you to burn out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Kash spoke up again. "Mr. Augustine, while we can't mass-produce super energy pistols, we can already mass-produce energy pistols.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Additionally, I've made some improvements and optimizations to the energy pistol. Its power is now greater. The Energex Materials can hold more energy, and after compression and amplification, the energy bullets can now pose a significant threat to Class AA warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Furthermore, I've developed an energy rifle and an energy sniper rifle. They have even greater power and can pose a huge threat to most Class AAA opponents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, for now, they can only be produced in small quantities."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Osborne's eyes lit up again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected the new energy pistols to be capable of threatening Class AA opponents, nor had he anticipated they'd managed to develop energy rifles and energy sniper rifles that could threaten Class AAA enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Although their power is not as great as the super energy pistol, they rely entirely on the user's own energy to fire without needing the Divine Bone Crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This means that as long as the user still has energy, they don't need to worry about running out of 'bullets'!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If these were equipped to the members of the Blood Demon Organization, their strength would be significantly enhanced."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Excellent! You've done a great job!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Immediately begin mass production of the energy pistols. We need at least five thousand of them! As for the energy rifles and energy sniper rifles, produce as many as you can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave the order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kash nodded. "Alright! I guarantee that within half a month, we will complete the production of five thousand energy pistols, five hundred energy rifles, and fifty energy sniper rifles!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, praised Kash generously, and gave him a substantial reward before leaving the research institute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, in his Dimensional Space, in addition to the super energy pistol, he also had a few of the new ordinary energy pistols, as well as a few energy rifles and energy sniper rifles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was now eager to find a worthy opponent to test the power of these weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this in mind, Osborne decided to head straight to receive the nine training bases that Godfather had rewarded him with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At these nine training bases, there were nearly five thousand instructors and trainees, including ten experts who had reached Class AAA.</span></p><div class="pagination">
