  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank goodness I still have half a month before the mission officially starts! If I hadn't told Athena I needed a break, she would've probably sent me to explore Divine Peak Nine right away, and that would have been a real nightmare," Osborne thought, his expression darkening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He never underestimated the dangers of Divine Peak Nine. Even though his space elemental essence had reached Level Seven, Osborne would never claim he could easily venture into Divine Peak Nine and guarantee his safe return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, four Deity King warriors had already died there, and many more had been injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The number of Deity Overlord warriors who had perished was beyond counting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was definitely something terrifying lurking in Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He recalled a previous encounter when the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity within him had sent out a frantic warning from a relatively safe spot just below Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne was reluctant to head to Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if he decided to go, he wanted to wait until his strength was even greater. However, due to Athena's insistence on assigning him a mission, he had no choice but to set out in half a month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And he would be going with Diana!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana, known as the cursed one, was rumored to attract hordes of Deathborn. However, this wasn't just a rumor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I'm going to go, I need to be stronger first," he mused, taking a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, his terminal chimed with a message&mdash;Diana was reaching out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, have you heard about the mission?" Diana's voice carried a hint of urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He nodded, even though she couldn't see him. "Yeah, I just found out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm so sorry, Osborne. I feel like I've dragged you into this mess!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her voice was laced with guilt. Diana believed her curse would only bring misfortune to those around her, and the thought of Osborne facing danger alongside her weighed heavily on her conscience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne chuckled, trying to lighten the mood. "Why are you apologizing? If anyone should be saying sorry, it's me. This whole mission was likely orchestrated by the Huntington family to target me. You're just a pawn in their game. If it weren't for me, you wouldn't be forced into this situation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana fell silent, taken aback by his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a moment, she firmly replied, "It doesn't matter. If I weren't cursed, they wouldn't have thought of this plan to get to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, both of them felt a sense of responsibility for the other's predicament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a long pause, Diana finally steadied her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, what do we do now? Divine Peak Nine is incredibly dangerous, especially that Celestial Crystal mining area. Even without my curse, getting there is a serious risk!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's why a Deity King and dozens of Deity Overlord warriors had to go last time! I doubt many will want to join me on this mission, and we might not even make it to the Celestial Crystal mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne remained calm. "Don't worry about it! There's no point in stressing over it now. We have half a month, and the most important thing is to focus on getting stronger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"For others, half a month might not mean much, even with Ultimate Essence Crystals, but for you, it's a different story. You can make significant progress in that time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, let's leave the base and head back to the 53rd mining area!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The training speed there is several times faster than here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded vigorously, determination shining in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, I'm all in! Let's head back to the 53rd mining area. For the next half month, I don't want to think about anything else&mdash;just pure training!" Diana declared, her determination evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sounds good!" Osborne replied, his enthusiasm matching hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After making their plans, the two set off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just a day after returning to their base, they were back at the 53rd mining area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, let's train right here!" Diana suggested eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head with a smile. "This place has a fast training speed, but it's not fast enough! I know of an even better spot. Follow me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's eyes widened in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was already the foot of Divine Peak Nine, the closest point to it, and the fastest training location available&mdash;unless they actually climbed Divine Peak Nine itself, there was no way to find a better place!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she didn't question Osborne; instead, she nodded firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without hesitation, Osborne led Diana into a parallel space. After a series of interdimensional travels, they arrived at the location where he had previously broken through to Level Seven in his space elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This spot was directly beneath Divine Peak Nine, and the training speed here was several times faster than at the 53rd mining area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this environment, one's comprehension could improve nearly a hundredfold!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana immediately felt the difference, her eyes wide with astonishment. She refrained from asking questions, even about Osborne's ability to navigate through the rocks using his spatial power&mdash;she was smart enough to keep that to herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly created a training space large enough for both of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then he pulled out a Dimensional Bag and handed it to Diana.</span></p><div class="pagination">
