  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick stared coldly at Callista and ordered her to come over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista's face was extremely grim. "I am your wife, your queen. That despicable brat is clearly trying to drive a wedge between us! Don't listen to him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She glared angrily at Osborne, the murderous intent in her eyes almost swallowing him whole.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne showed no fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He spoke calmly, "Callista's words just now really upset me. Four slaps aren't enough anymore; it has to be six. Otherwise, I'll take the key right now and step into the black vortex myself&mdash;no one else will enter the Skyfall Casket!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne finished speaking and pretended to rush toward the black vortex.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick's expression changed drastically. "Stop!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stopped in his tracks. "I'll give you five breaths. If you don't act by then, there's nothing more to discuss!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick gave Osborne a deep look, then turned to Callista. "You, come here!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista was furious, "His words can't be trusted at all..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Eight!" Osborne coldly interrupted Callista, "Every time you insult me, that's two more slaps. You can keep going, but your time is running out!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Only three breaths left!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You..." Callista's face was full of resentment and anger, yet she was completely helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Frederick's cold expression, her heart trembled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the queen, she knew Frederick better than anyone else, fully aware of his character and desires.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, she stopped arguing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She gritted her teeth, walked up to Frederick, and closed her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, her hatred for Osborne had reached its peak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If given the chance, she would seize Osborne without hesitation, torment him mercilessly, and repay all the humiliation she suffered today.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick made his move.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He slapped Callista hard across the face, the crisp sound echoing in the air, his expression remaining emotionless. Then, another slap followed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Smack!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone around remained silent, watching Frederick slap Callista, feeling that everything was just too strange.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne let out a cold snort. "Frederick, did you skip a meal? And to think you're the Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness! Even the dogs I raise have more strength than you! Is that a slap or a caress? If you intend to brush me off like this, I see no sincerity from you, so let's not talk anymore!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne picked up the Violet-blooded Bronze Spear again, ready to charge into the black vortex.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick's expression changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He immediately increased the force, landing an even harsher slap on Callista's face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Smack!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though Callista was also a Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior, she staggered from the blow, nearly falling to the ground. Blood seeped from the corner of her mouth, and her eyes were filled with venomous resentment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she didn&rsquo;t dare resent Frederick, only glaring viciously at Osborne. If looks could kill, Osborne would have died countless times.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Smack!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Smack!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Smack!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick, with a cold expression, slapped Callista's cheeks repeatedly, quickly leaving her face swollen and disheveled, with no trace of her former dignity, looking like a madwoman.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such a scene filled Osborne's heart with immense satisfaction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He whispered in his heart, "Mother, did you see Callista's state? Back then, she stopped us and slapped you, but now I've made Frederick slap her eight times! Do you feel avenged?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Callista with disdain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could never forget that time in Nebula City when he was strolling hand in hand with Michelle, and Callista suddenly appeared and slapped Michelle in public.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His tragic fate in his previous life began with that slap.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, Osborne had finally waited for the chance to take revenge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, this was far from enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was just the beginning.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Smack! Smack! Smack!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick slapped Callista ten times in a row, leaving her face covered in blood, then stopped and turned to Osborne. "Are you satisfied?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and replied, "I told you to slap her eight times, but you gave her ten, adding two extra for me? I see your sincerity."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But I wonder, has your relationship as a couple already fallen apart? Are you using this opportunity to deliberately take revenge on Callista?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick coldly questioned, "What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shrugged. "I mean, punishing Callista isn't enough. You need to keep proving your sincerity to me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His gaze swept over the other Royal Family members.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The people he stared at instantly turned pale, their eyes filled with fear and anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's lips curved slightly as he calmly said, "I heard Weston is outstanding and highly likely to take your place as the next ruler of the Glorious Divine Kingdom. Quinn is also a strong contender."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Naomi's no exception. Those three&mdash;they're probably your finest kids, right? Add Hendrix to the mix, and if you can slap each of the four ten times, I might just start to believe you're actually serious."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I promise, I will definitely use the key to open the Eighth Skyfall Casket!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick's face turned extremely grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Weston, Quinn, Naomi, and Hendrix were all furious at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They clenched their fists, boiling with killing intent, but dared not say anything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Callista's fate was right before their eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they dared to speak, Osborne would surely make Frederick strike even harder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Weston snorted coldly, took the initiative to step in front of Frederick, and calmly said, "Father, please go ahead. As long as it helps you enter the Skyfall Casket, I don't mind taking a few slaps. Besides, you are my father."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was a strategy of retreating to advance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Weston knew these slaps were unavoidable. Even if they were unwilling, Frederick would inevitably act to enter the Eighth Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since that was the case, he might as well take the initiative, perhaps leaving a better impression on Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne laughed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said coldly, "It seems Weston really enjoys being slapped by Frederick, huh? In that case, I'll grant your wish!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"For the others, ten slaps are enough!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But Weston, he must be slapped twenty times, not one less!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Weston's face instantly changed, filled with rage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he clenched his teeth tightly and still said nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his heart, just like Callista, he was already filled with hatred for Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as he gets the chance, he will make Osborne pay a heavy price.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Slap!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick showed no expression as he began carrying out the orders. To him, neither his wife nor children mattered; what was important was entering Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clap, clap, clap!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What followed was a series of sharp, piercing slaps, echoing in the air for a long time.</span></p><div class="pagination">
