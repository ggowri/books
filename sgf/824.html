  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was rendered speechless, realizing he had underestimated the Williamson family's cunning.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Honor Quest Ceremony for Cuthbert was not just a celebration but a well-laid trap. They had prepared for the possibility of losing the divine artifact, the Volt Hammer, by ensuring they could summon it back with the Thundergod Gloves.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their plan was nearly flawless!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Had it not been for Isa's insistence on compensation with a top-grade divine artifact and the fact that the Thundergod Gloves were the Williamson family's only such artifact, Osborne would have walked right into their snare.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon returning to Rosmandi and finding the Volt Hammer missing, Osborne would have been utterly bewildered, never suspecting the Williamson family's hand in its disappearance.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Peter looked somewhat embarrassed and quickly changed the subject. "The Thundergod Gloves are no ordinary top-grade divine artifact. They're said to be deeply connected to the most powerful legendary artifact, the Hammer of Thor.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's rumored that by wearing the Thundergod Glovess, one can sense the location of Hammer of Thor and potentially find it."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was visibly shaken by this revelation.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Through the Thundergod Gloves, I can sense Hammer of Thor's location and find Hammer of Thor? Have you sensed its location?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Peter's embarrassment persisted.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No," he admitted.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's excitement waned.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if Hammer of Thor remained lost, Thundergod Gloves stood as a top-grade divine artifact, capable of amplifying the Volt Hammer's power, transforming the already formidable weapon into something truly terrifying.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even wielded alone, without the Volt Hammer, the gloves could transform into the ultimate boxing gauntlet, infusing the wearer's fists with a surge of strength.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without hesitation, Osborne claimed the Thundergod Gloves.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Peter's eyes brimmed with reluctance, a silent storm of hesitation. Yet, as his gaze flickered towards the icy demeanor of Isa, his lips sealed shut.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Night, we've paid our compensation. May we leave now?" Peter inquired cautiously.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa smiled as she turned to Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you have any other requests, Osborne? Speak freely; they won't refuse."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne hesitated.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With nervous tension, Peter stared at Osborne and dreaded the thought that Osborne might, once again, propose another unreasonable demand.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I want nothing more, but I have questions that need honest answers."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Relief washed over Peter.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His heart lightened with the realization that Osborne sought nothing further.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ask away. We'll answer truthfully if we know."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne pressed on. "Your Williamson family has a good relationship with the Aberrants, right?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Peter paused but nodded.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We do. There's been no conflict for decades, but we're not allies. We simply coexist and jointly maintain the structure of Tethynia."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne nodded and asked with a hint of anxiety, "Have you noticed any unusual movements from the King of the Aberrants recently?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His concern was palpable.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It had been some time since Sebastian had ventured alone into the Aberrants. With no news and no way to contact him, Osborne feared the worst.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, he held his tongue. What if Sebastian's cover remained intact? To ask outright could unwittingly unravel the secrecy shrouding his location.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Peter's features were etched with clear lines of hesitation.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're asking about Sebastian Augustine from Rosmandi, right?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's body tensed. "You know him?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Peter nodded, stating, "I do. Just three days ago, I sensed a battle between him and the King of the Aberrants.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Both are top S-class warriors, ranked on the Quasi-Divine Rankings. I was curious to witness such a clash.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But by the time I arrived, Sebastian was gone. Only the King of the Aberrants remained. I asked if he had killed Sebastian, and he denied it, saying he had only inflicted severe injuries and let Sebastian escape.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then, the King of the Aberrants left without further explanation."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Peter's words hung in the air, a visible shiver ran through Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He savored what Peter had said and pondered, "Sebastian had a fight with the King of the Aberrants?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian was seriously injured?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're not lying to me?" Osborne demanded and clenched his fists in worry.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Peter hastened to affirm, uttering, "I swear on my honor that every word I've spoken is the truth! I witnessed the aftermath at the battleground. The ground was stained with copious amounts of Sebastian's blood.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"His injuries must be grave."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne took a deep breath and looked solemn.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Peter looked to Isa, who dismissed them with a wave of her hand. They fled as if pardoned, leaving Osborne and Isa alone amidst the weight of the news.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, don't let it consume you," Isa said gently.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her hand caressed his cheek. "I, too, felt the ripples of that battle, but I was preoccupied with my search and didn't investigate further. Sebastian must be alive; I can vouch for that. However, he is indeed gravely injured and likely seeking a place to recover.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"With his strength, as long as he's alive, he will heal in time. Once he recovers, he'll return."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne nodded vigorously, clinging to this hope.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, as long as he's not dead!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His gaze then shifted to Isa. Determination burned in his eyes.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Isa, I want to grow stronger!"</p><div class="pagination">
