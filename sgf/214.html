  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena inquired, eyeing Osborne intently, "How about now? Scared yet?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I told you, not only are they individually strong, but they also wield significant power. Whether it's the Augustine family or the Draco Group, they have many supporters. Does that make you more afraid?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For instance, Vincent commands an elite team of a hundred members, all Class B at the weakest!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then there's Matthew, the big young master of this generation; the senior figures of the Augustine family mostly back him. He's got the money and the connections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And Owen, his mother's family is incredibly powerful, almost on par with the Augustine family. He can easily mobilize his mother's family's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, Emma is no pushover. As the most extraordinary figure in the Augustine family, she's also the most beautiful woman in Newport City. She has many admirers. Just a word from her and countless experts would fight for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, their network of relationships is beyond your imagination! Heirs of various ancient families and descendants of nobility are all their friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She concluded, observing Osborne's serious expression before calmly asking, "So, are you afraid now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snapped back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, faced with such formidable opponents, he might have despaired, even considered hiding where no one could find him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Osborne felt no fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything he now possessed was beyond his wildest dreams. Just over two weeks ago, he had been divorced by Ophelia, cast out of the Caldwell family with nothing to his name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, he had nothing, his sister's life hanging by a thread, feeling hopeless and helpless, even contemplating death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could never have imagined that in just over two weeks, he would have the power and wealth he now held.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a transformation of the spirit, a transformation that made Osborne unafraid of the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "What does it matter if my opponents are strong? What if I lose? It's just returning to having nothing or even death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whatever happens, I'm not afraid anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Let's do this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm just surprised, that's all. They are indeed all powerful and extraordinary, but trying to make me afraid? They won't succeed!" Osborne stated confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena looked at Osborne in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne's expression was not a facade, she smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're stronger than I thought."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied with a faint smile, "Thank you for the compliment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They probably don't see me as a rival now, do they? I'm not a threat to them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena shook her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're wrong! Once they know of your existence, they will see you as their biggest rival because only you are Godfather's grandson!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether it's the Augustine family or the Draco Group, Godfather's trusted allies are numerous. If given a choice, they would prefer to support Godfather's own grandson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They know this, just as I do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, as long as they find out about you, they will see you as their greatest competition and will stop at nothing to eliminate you before you grow stronger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena warned, observing Osborne's furrowed brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She reassured, smiling, "Don't be nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One thing you've done well is hiding your identity. Apart from a few like me, no one knows you're Godfather's grandson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you continue to keep your identity hidden, it won't be easy for them to discover you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, they will eventually uncover your secret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I came to find you this time to remind you to be prepared as soon as possible! The power struggles among ancient families can sometimes be more bloody and cruel than wars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they find you and you're not ready, your ending will be extremely tragic. Your strength is still far behind. Your only task now is to improve rapidly, at least become a power master, so that you have some ability to protect yourself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At the same time, you need to develop your own forces and expand your circle of friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In short, do your best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are Godfather's grandson, and I hope one day you can become the new Godfather."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Serena closed her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew that Serena was asking him to leave. He fell silent for a moment, then stood up and bowed to Serena without saying anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hernandez, thank you for telling me this, no matter what. I will work hard! Not to become the new Godfather, nor for the position of head of the Augustine family, but to prove that I, Osborne, am not inferior to anyone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And also to save my sister!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For this goal, I will stop at nothing. Whoever dares to stand in my way, I will kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne then turned to leave the small courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena opened her eyes and looked at Osborne's back, her face filled with surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This little guy might really be able to create miracles! I hope your fate won't be like your father's. Come on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just don't die..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
