  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's icy gaze bore into Nell, her petite frame standing like an immovable wall before Nell, making it crystal clear: without an apology, Nell wasn't leaving this place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nell's expression twisted in anger. "You want me to apologize to an Ascension One human weakling? Not a chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda smiled, a beautiful sight that transformed into something unsettling in Nell's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the hairs on the back of her neck stood on end, and a dangerous sense of peril washed over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a glint of menace in her eyes, Alfreda declared, "Since you're unwilling to apologize, I guess I'll just have to put you through a beating first, then make you apologize!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she advanced toward Nell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fury on Nell's face deepened as she responded with a contemptuous huff, her divine artifact dagger hissing with the ferocity of a striking snake. A dark fog swirled around her like a tempest, forming countless barbed spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nell sneered, saying, "Princess Alfreda, you've really gone too far! If you're looking for a fight, then bring it on! You're nothing but a Nature Elf with a fading bloodline, and you think you can force me to apologize to a worthless human brat? Not a chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As her words lingered in the air, Nell unleashed her power, plunging the entire inn into absolute darkness&mdash;an eclipse conjured from her dark power, Eclipse of Eternity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even those at the same Ascension Five rank would lose their senses in this enveloping blackness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alfreda stood unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, emerald sparks ignited in the void, bathing the room in a shimmering glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda raised her hand, weaving streams of light that painted ancient elven runes. As the light grew brighter, Nell's horror deepened when she realized a twisted membrane of light ensnared her body, as if she were trapped in a cage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Temporal Amber?! The deadly forbidden technique of the Nature Elf Clan&mdash;Temporal Amber?!" Nell gasped in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suspended mid-air in an attacking stance, she found the consuming blackness burning away into radiant stardust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nell's eyes were filled with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way! You're an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King, just like me! How can you overpower me like this? It's impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nell thrashed in panic, but the Temporal Amber intensified its grip, strangling her as despair settled in. No matter how hard she fought, she couldn't break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apologize!" Alfreda's voice was as cold as ice, piercing through Nell's defiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nell clenched her teeth, refusing to give in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, she yelled, "Pierce! Killian! Harley! Why aren't you helping me?! If I'm forced to apologize to that lowly human loser, you'll be caught in it too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them shared uneasy glances, their expressions darkening with resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Princess Alfreda, we're sorry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Killian's voice was frigid as he sprang into action. He waved his hand, and suddenly, ice shards erupted throughout the inn, freezing the surrounding air in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed at Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless ice shards shot toward her, ready to explode on impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the next moment, a thorned crown materialized on Alfreda's forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a hum of power, she dispelled the icy assault effortlessly, unharmed and unbothered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me handle this!" Pierce roared, summoning an Apex divine artifact&mdash;the Lightning Spear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, as he hurled it forward, Alfreda snatched it from the air with her bare hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spear, wrapped in ancient runes, began disintegrating in her grip, with bolts of lightning&mdash;capable of shattering mountains&mdash;becoming docile as they wrapped around her fingertips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pierce's face went pale, his confidence shaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's face grew even colder, her voice slicing through the air like a blade. "Do you have any other tricks up your sleeve? If so, now's the time to show them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words echoed with almost divine authority, and as she spoke, countless vines descended from the ceiling, wrapping around her like a protective shroud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you have nothing left..." Alfreda continued, but before she could finish, Harley's bandages sprang to life, darting toward her with astonishing speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they didn't stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the cursed wrappings brushed against the hem of Alfreda's dress, they erupted into green flames, reducing the ancient, unyielding bandages&mdash;an Apex divine artifact&mdash;to nothing but ash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley, now stripped of his defenses, revealed a bronze body covered in runes, shock etched across his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda sneered, saying, "Is this really all you've got?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apologize."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she slowly approached Nell, her emerald eyes radiating lethal intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't apologize, you might just find yourself dead right here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nell's heart felt as if it were encased in ice, but she refused to back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's all attack together!" she shouted, momentarily breaking free from the grip of the Temporal Amber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her divine artifact dagger morphing into a shadowy blur, she lunged at Alfreda's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Killian summoned an ice storm that surged toward Alfreda, turning the air around them into crystalline blue shards. Pierce yanked the horn from his head, slamming it into the ground, summoning a cataclysmic lightning dragon that charged toward her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Harley's bronze form glowed with golden light as he joined the attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four of them struck as one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne felt the weight of the moment, his instincts urging him to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alfreda stopped him with a wink, a playful assurance that everything was under control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just sit tight!" she seemed to say, and then she made her move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vines, now animated by her will, erupted into action, enveloping the inn in a vibrant green glow. They darted forth, piercing through the lightning dragon's throat, shattering it in an instant before turning to Pierce, who felt a sharp pain as they struck his shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without pausing, the vines raced toward Harley, impaling his golden form with brutal force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They shattered the ice storm, striking Killian and eliciting a chilling scream from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, the vines lashed out at Nell, sending her flying backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a heartbeat, the place fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nell, Pierce, Killian, and Harley&mdash;four powerful Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings&mdash;lay crumpled on the ground like discarded dolls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now!" Alfreda's cold laughter filled the air as she stepped up to Nell, placing her foot on the hand that clutched the divine artifact dagger. "Ready to apologize?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nell's face was a mask of shock as she spat blood, her voice hoarse. "We're part of the Racial Convergence Planet..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another vine shot out, sending her flying across the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's eyes glinted with a savage light, a fury unlike anything she'd shown before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll count to three. If you don't apologize to Osborne, I'll end you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
