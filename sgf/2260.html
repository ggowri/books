  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To prevent the strongest contenders from facing each other too early and getting eliminated, the city duel had a seeding system in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top three from Azure Haven Academy, Fantasia Isle, and Mystic Sirius Sect were designated as seed players, ensuring they wouldn't clash during the preliminary rounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that Osborne wouldn't have to face Leroy, Marreese, Tyson, Clara, or Pero until later in the competition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, in the Azure Haven Academy's arena, the atmosphere was electric.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The number of disciples from Azure Haven Academy far outnumbered those from Mystic Sirius Sect, and many from Fantasia Isle and other factions had come to watch, making the arena feel incredibly crowded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the buzz of excited chatter filled the air, the drawing of lots for the group matches officially began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nine seeded players were called up first to draw their lots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was here that Osborne finally laid eyes on Leroy, the leading disciple of Azure Haven Academy and the top contender for the championship in this city duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was young and strikingly beautiful, but her cold demeanor gave off an unapproachable vibe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the other competitors from her academy seemed to be ignored by her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curious about her abilities, Osborne activated his Satan's Eye to get a read on Leroy's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he did, Leroy suddenly turned her head, locking her icy gaze on him. Her brow furrowed slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart raced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Has she sensed me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>What sharp instincts! I'm trying to use Satan's Eye to gauge her, and she's already caught on! There's a strange power surrounding her that's blocking my vision, making it impossible to see her true strength.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Definitely a formidable opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne concluded, feeling the weight of the situation settle on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Racial Convergence Planet is indeed full of geniuses. This is just the city duel, and I'm already facing such a powerful, tricky adversary. Interesting.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave Leroy a nod before shifting his focus to Clara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Marreese caught sight of Leroy turning her head and felt a surge of curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leroy, what's up?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy glanced at Marreese and replied coolly, "Nothing much! Just sensing a worthy opponent. I hope he can give me a bit of a challenge in the arena."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she fell silent, leaving Marreese scratching his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly craned his neck to see who this so-called worthy opponent could be, but there was nothing in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A furrow formed on his brow; it was hardly ever that Leroy considered someone "worthy".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Who could it be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Tyson? No way! Tyson's good, but I'm pretty sure I can beat him. Could it be Clara?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marreese's eyes flitted over to Clara, who was also in the process of drawing her lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face grew solemn as he caught a whiff of the Sacred Power radiating from Clara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sacred Power! </span><span>So</span><span> Clara from Fantasia Isle has been holding back too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She's mastered Sacred Power, but she doesn't seem as devious as Leroy. Still, she's definitely a force to be reckoned with!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's spirits sank as he sized up the competition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This city duel is turning out to be one heck of a showdown! Two dark horses, both packing Sacred Power! How fascinating... and this is just the city duel. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>By the time we reach the state and zone duels, I bet everyone will have Sacred Power!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the pressure building up, Osborne zeroed in on the task at hand </span><span>as</span><span> </span><span>the draw started.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swiftly completed his draw and found himself slotted as a seed player in Group Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, all sixty-four participants had completed their lot-draws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Group Six, apart from Osborne, there were two other competitors&mdash;Quincy Afflalo from Azure Haven Academy and Lavoy Amundson from Fantasia Isle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last participant was Earl Ayres, hailing from a Third-rate Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quincy had snagged the eighth place in Azure Haven Academy's tournament, while Lavoy had come in sixth at Fantasia Isle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Earl Ayres, there was no intel available, but making it through the ranks of hundreds of Third-rate Powers was a clear sign that he was no pushover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ladies and gentlemen, the city duel of Tempest Fortress City is officially kicking off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The proclamation from the higher-ups of Azure Haven Academy reverberated through the arena, and the excitement in the air was tangible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To boost efficiency, four arenas were set up, with battles raging simultaneously in each one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Osborne was in Group Six, his fight hadn't started yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He holed up in the competitors' lounge, eyes shut, deep in meditation, tuning out the ruckus around him. In his eyes, the skill disparity among the participants was so vast that it wasn't worth his attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the matches featuring Leroy and Clara didn't hold much appeal, as their opponents were unlikely to push them to their full potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The real hurdles would only surface once the top sixteen were decided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While these matches seemed like a piece of cake to Osborne, they were a whole different ballgame for the spectators.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every contestant in the city duel was a bona-fide genius.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fierce battles on the platforms had the audience sitting on the edge of their seats, gasping in amazement at the diverse techniques and displays of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But none of this fazed Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stayed laser-focused, and he wasn't the only one showing indifference. Leroy, Clara, Marreese, and Tyson were in the same camp, eyes closed, seemingly oblivious to the unfolding spectacle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the rounds rolled on, the winners and losers were quickly determined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group matches were scheduled to span three days, with each contestant obligated to fight once a day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time it was Osborne's turn, the afternoon sun blazed high in the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His opponent was Lavoy, the sixth-ranked disciple from Fantasia Isle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the referee called Osborne's name, he finally opened his eyes and sauntered towards the arena where Lavoy was waiting for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lavoy wore a solemn expression. After all, he was pitted against the top disciple from Mystic Sirius Sect. Even though Mystic Sirius Sect had seen its glory days fade, he was well aware that Osborne's strength dwarfed his own, and Lavoy had little chance of emerging victorious. His sole objective was to show off his skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sadly</span><span> for Lavoy, Osborne wasn't in the mood for any dilly-dallying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, he whipped out his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow and nocked an arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrow, infused with Sacred Power, shot forth, shattering Lavoy's offensive and defensive measures alike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It pierced through Lavoy's shoulder, sending him tumbling out of the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mystic Sirius Sect's Osborne wins!" the referee declared, and Osborne quickly exited the stage, returning to the competitors' area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only then that the crowd erupted in chatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, this Osborne from Mystic Sirius Sect is a real force to be reckoned with! He took down Lavoy from Fantasia Isle with just one shot! Lavoy might be the sixth-ranked in his sect, but he didn't even stand a chance against a single arrow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King? How could he be so strong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still, he's got quite a hill to climb if he wants to measure up to Leroy! They both possess Sacred Power, but I'd put my money on Leroy being even stronger! And they both have quasi-Sacred Artifacts. Leroy's defenses are out of this world&mdash;Marreese's powerful attacks couldn't even breach her guard. Osborne doesn't seem capable of that. All in all, Leroy is definitely the one to watch out for!"</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
