  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking in the direction where Agatha disappeared, Osborne couldn't help but frown.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt that Agatha was a bit strange today and thought, "What did that look she gave me at the end mean?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned and thought for a long time but couldn't figure it out.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Forget it. I shouldn't dwell on this. With Agatha's strength, she will surely pass the zone duel and participate in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I need to work hard from now on. I've already said I'll defeat her again next time. If she beats me in the zone duel or the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, I'll lose face."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The state duel is finally coming to an end.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After defeating Agatha, Osborne's points skyrocketed by over a million, reaching more than 11 million, while Agatha's points dropped to over 9 million.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even so, Agatha's points were still over 3 million higher than the third-ranked Horace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The champion and runner-up of the state duel are already decided.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, intense discussions erupted once again in Frost Peak City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Agatha is the Dark Phoenix, but she actually lost. How did Osborne do it? Why can't I understand?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why did Agatha suddenly act like she lost her mind, withdrew her power, and gave up resisting? She was clearly in absolute control. She was obviously about to win. Can someone tell me? What exactly happened?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My God. The state </span><span>duel</span><span> champion is actually Osborne, not Agatha. Who could have predicted this outcome before the state duel began?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne not only won the state </span><span>duel</span><span> championship, but his two teammates Clara and Leroy also made it into the top ten."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Three people from one team all made it into the top ten? This has never happened before in previous state duels. Osborne had previously allocated five million points each to Clara and Leroy, and I thought at the time that Osborne was too foolish and would lose the championship because of it. But now I realize Osborne wasn't foolish. The foolish one was me, and Osborne was confident. He believed he could catch up with his points and win the championship with his strength."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's incredible. He's only at Ascension Nine right now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's impressive, but Agatha is still stronger. She must have had some physical issue; otherwise, Osborne couldn't have won."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Exactly. Agatha is clearly stronger."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, Agatha is the Dark Phoenix. She'll only get stronger in the future. Her bloodline will make her grow at a terrifying speed. If they meet again, Osborne will be defeated by Agatha."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although Osborne is the Zephyr State state </span><span>duel</span><span> champion, among those below the Empyrean Sacredness level in Zephyr State, I think Agatha is the strongest."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>People kept talking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some people greatly admired Osborne. In their eyes, Osborne becoming the champion was nothing short of a miracle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But many also believed that Osborne's victory was just luck, thinking that if not for Agatha's health issues, Osborne wouldn't have stood a chance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But anyway, the fight for the state </span><span>duel</span><span> championship is over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, the state duel completely ended, and the leaderboard stopped changing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The champion is Osborne, with 11.08 million points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The runner-up is Agatha, with 9.85 million points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The third place is Horace, with 6.5 million points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fourth place is Clara, with 5.8 million points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fifth place is Leroy, with 5.8 million points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Broderick and Benson, after consecutive defeats, dropped to 5 million points, ranking sixth and seventh respectively.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The eighth, ninth, and tenth places are Lincoln, Harper Xenon, and Forrest Clint, respectively.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The top ten are all confirmed. These top ten will represent Zephyr State in the Eastern Zone 3's zone duel three months later.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, all three from Tempest Fortress City made it into the top ten, becoming the absolute focus. Mystic Sirius Sect also emerged as the biggest winner thanks to Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next is the award ceremony and the departure ceremony.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After everything ended, Osborne's Kingdom Duel Scorepoints on his badge increased by a full one million points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anywhere, this one million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints can be exchanged for at least one million Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And one million Sacred Crystals are enough to buy a Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very satisfied with this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But unfortunately, in this state duel, he didn't find a casino to place bets. Otherwise, he would have made a fortune again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go. We're heading back to Mystic Sirius Sect now." Angela appeared beside Osborne, pulling him to leave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned. "Ms. Olsen, do we need to be in such a hurry?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela nodded, looking very serious. She hadn't forgotten what Adriana told her about leaving immediately with Osborne after the state duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "Something big is bound to happen here soon. We need to leave quickly to avoid getting involved."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing her words, Osborne was even more surprised, thinking, "Something big will happen here? What could it be?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He scanned the surroundings but didn't notice anything unusual. However, Agatha was surrounded by Ember Phoenix Clan warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, Ember Phoenix Clan warriors kept arriving, encircling Agatha in the center. Many of them exuded an incredibly powerful aura, even stronger than Angela's. Their expressions were extremely serious and solemn.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This puzzled Osborne. He couldn't help but ask, "What's going on with the Ember Phoenix Clan?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela paused for a moment, then shook her head. "This has nothing to do with you. Let's leave quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned deeply, feeling that the big event Angela mentioned must be related to the Ember Phoenix Clan and Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at Agatha but found her looking very calm. She had returned to her indifference, as if everyone owed her money.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As if sensing Osborne's gaze, Agatha looked at him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she nodded at Osborne and smiled slightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly smiled and nodded as well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the next second, Agatha's voice echoed in Osborne's mind. "Osborne, you'd better leave Frost Peak City immediately."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why?" Osborne quickly asked, "Ms. Olsen told me to leave immediately, and now you're telling me the same. Is something wrong? Does this have anything to do with you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne waited for a long time without receiving a reply from Agatha, while Angela had already brought him near the translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as they entered the translocator, they could quickly leave Frost Peak City and return to Tempest Fortress City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Agatha's voice finally sounded. "Osborne, don't tell anyone about you merging my nine drops of Phoenix Blood and igniting the Dark Phoenix Flame. Otherwise, you'll be in big trouble. Goodbye."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately turned his head and saw Agatha waving at him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was about to ask again, but Angela urged him to quickly enter the translocator. "We need to leave here immediately."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Angela's expression was extremely serious. She pulled Osborne quickly into the translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Osborne noticed that the translocators in Frost Peak City were operating frantically. Wave after wave of spectators hurriedly left Frost Peak City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very puzzled, feeling that the situation was strange, but he couldn't figure out why.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the translocator they were in finally activated. Filled with confusion, Osborne disappeared into the translocator.</span></p><div class="pagination">
