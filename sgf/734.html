  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ninety-five challengers defeated in the Honor Quest Ceremony?" Osborne muttered under his breath, clenching his fists tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His breathing quickened as he pictured the scene from decades ago. Godfather battled young warriors from all over the world in his Honor Quest Ceremony, defeating each opponent one by one, only to fall before the ninety-sixth challenger due to exhaustion or the sheer strength of his opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "At the moment of defeat, Godfather must have been filled with deep regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe that's why he insists that I hold an Honor Quest Ceremony of my own, hoping that I can pass it perfectly, defeating every challenger until I become so strong that no one dares to challenge me anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bitter smile appeared on Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Godfather's expectations for me are too high. If he himself only defeated ninety-five challengers, how can I hope to defeat them all perfectly?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How can I possibly fight until no one dares to challenge me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've only reached Class AA!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And I'm only twenty-five!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath. "How old was Godfather when he held his Honor Quest Ceremony?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thirty-five!" Emma answered without hesitation, clearly recalling the details vividly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At that time, Godfather had just been at Class AAA for five years. He believed the timing was right, so he held the Honor Quest Ceremony. In fact, if Godfather had waited another five years, until he was on the verge of breaking through to Class S, even if he didn't defeat every challenger perfectly, he would have had a good chance of defeating more than a hundred challengers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hint of regret flashed in Emma's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This might also have been Godfather's regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather was thirty-five when he held his Honor Quest Ceremony, and he was the youngest in Augustine's family history to hold an Honor Quest Ceremony. Typically, anyone under forty-five can hold one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather defeated ninety-five challengers, the most in the Augustine family's history. Aside from him, only one of our ancestors defeated sixty-four challengers. The other four ancestors defeated fewer than fifty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's expression turned bitter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our Augustine family has held six Honor Quest Ceremonies, losing six divine artifacts in the process! And each time, it cost us 500 billion&nbsp;dollars!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now you understand why I tried to persuade you not to agree to host an Honor Quest Ceremony, don't you? And you see why everyone else is against it, too, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you hold an Honor Quest Ceremony and fail to defeat all challengers, the Augustine family is bound to lose a divine artifact and 500 billion&nbsp;dollars in wealth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face grew serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Such an Honor Quest Ceremony is indeed brutal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If one is defeated in the Honor Quest Ceremony, one must give the victor a divine artifact and 500 billion&nbsp;dollars in wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>500 billion dollars is a massive sum!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, most Ancient Families couldn't even come up with that amount of money."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne was still determined to participate!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, it was what Godfather demanded of him, and it was what Godfather expected of him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to participate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, do you know how old those three who perfectly cleared the Honor Quest Ceremony, defeating all challengers, were when they held it?" Osborne asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma was taken aback. "Of course I know, but what does that have to do with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "What if I manage to perfectly clear the Honor Quest Ceremony? I want to know if I would be the youngest to do so."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's mouth dropped open as she looked at Osborne in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you really think you can pull that off?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Never mind clearing it perfectly. Even if you could defeat a hundred challengers, or even fifty, you'd be the youngest!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're only twenty-five!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I'm not mistaken, out of the sixty-three who managed to defeat fifty challengers, the youngest was twenty-seven! And among the nine who defeated a hundred challengers, the youngest was thirty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the three who defeated all challengers, fighting until no one dared to challenge them again, the youngest was Helios, who was thirty-one at the time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, if you manage to perfectly pass the Honor Quest Ceremony, defeating everyone, fighting until no one dares to challenge you, not only would you be the youngest to achieve a perfect clearance, but you'd be six years younger than Helios was when he did it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But that's impossible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma sighed, not believing for a second that Osborne would succeed. She thought that if Osborne could defeat fifty challengers in the Honor Quest Ceremony, it would already be a miracle that would go down in world history.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne opened his mouth but didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, he felt that Godfather's expectations for him were too high. With his current strength, he felt he had no chance of hosting an Honor Quest Ceremony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Will the Honor Quest Ceremony turn into my ceremony of shame?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Emma's explanation, even Osborne felt he had no chance of winning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Honor Quest Ceremony would gather the world's young warriors!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By that time, those who weren't at least Class AAA might be too embarrassed to even step up to the challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this really something a human can accomplish?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
