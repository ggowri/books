They quickly retreated to the deeper confines of their headquarters, utilizing their defenses to fend off the impending assaults.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But things weren't looking good for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a desperate bid to save the Draco Armed Services Branch personnel, he had found himself caught in a tight encirclement. The eight Class S clones blocked every potential escape route.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you're dead meat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're the person we're mandated to eliminate! It's just plain stupid of you to put yourself in such danger for those useless idiots!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well then, let's send you to your grave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eight Class S clones launched themselves at Osborne simultaneously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, the weight of their collective assault bore down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could handle three, maybe even take them out, but eight Class S clones? That was a different ballgame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Osborne was just a Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Osborne unleashed his Light Realm, transforming his body into a radiant sun. The multicolored brilliance created an aura that enveloped both himself and the eight Class S clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Realm? How's that going to help?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've got eight of us! How long do you think your little trick can hold up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Medusa Queen barked, "Shatter his Realm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eight clones didn't waste a second; instead of going for Osborne directly, they focused on attacking the Light Realm itself, intent on smashing it to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression hardened; this was exactly what he had feared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Light Realm, powerful and fortified at Level Four, could withstand quite a bit, even from Class S foes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But facing all eight at once was a different challenge altogether.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Light Realm trembled violently as cracks began to spread across its surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this kept up, it would shatter in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth, fury igniting in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You want to break my Realm? Fine! I'll kill a few more of you before that happens</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Destruction Orbs! Disintegration Rays!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, countless luminous orbs rained down, and fearsome beams crisscrossed through the Light Realm, filling every nook and cranny with devastation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of the Destruction Orbs and Disintegration Rays wreaked havoc even among the Class S clones, pushing them into a frenzied state. The six clones, excluding the two Tauren Kings, scrambled to defend themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tauren Kings, cover us!" the Medusa Queen shouted, quickly devising a strategy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She ordered the two Tauren Kings to use their massive bodies as shields against the Destruction Orbs and Disintegration Rays, while the others continued to hammer away at Osborne's Light Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cracks spread across Osborne's Realm like spiderwebs, and his expression darkened as he snorted derisively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think you can withstand this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift flick of his wrist, he tightened his grip on the Goddess of Grain's scythe and charged at the nearest Tauren King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The colossal creatures stared down at Osborne, their eyes gleaming with scorn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't possibly believe that he could hurt them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, pride would cost them dearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With an effortless swing, the sharp edge of the Goddess of Grain's scythe sliced through one of the Tauren Kings' tough </span><span>hide</span><span>, taking off half of its head in a single </span><span>stroke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation sent shockwaves through the remaining seven Class S clones as they stared wide-eyed at the scythe of the Goddess of Grain clutched in Osborne's hand, apprehension flashing in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa Queen barked her orders, urgency lacing her tone, "Watch out for the scythe!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Titan King, you guys need to stop him! Don't let him attack the Tauren King!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, one Tauren King lay slain by Osborne in an instant, leaving only one standing between them and Destruction Orbs and Disintegration Rays.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that one fell, they'd be in serious trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Titan Kings sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though their defenses might not rival those of the Tauren King, they were still formidable. The Destruction Orbs and Disintegration Rays hurled towards them could inflict damage, but they couldn't deal a fatal blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They surged forward, weathering the relentless orbs and rays as they charged at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the Light Realm crumbling around him, Osborne gritted his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't hold back any longer! Time to meet your end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne unleashed the power from the Divine Bone in his right leg, propelling himself forward with a ferocious kick aimed at one Titan King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A catastrophic explosion echoed through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Osborne's modest stature, that kick obliterated the Titan King's massive form into countless shards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bring it on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, Osborne lunged at the second Titan King, delivering another earth-shattering kick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second Titan King met the same fate, his body erupting in a dazzling explosion, lifeless before he could even react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as the dust settled and the echoes faded, Osborne suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Light Realm had shattered!</span></p><div class="pagination">
