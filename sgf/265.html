  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguards of the Ashford family were not weak; they were professionally trained experts whose strength and speed reached the Class D martial artists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several of them attacked simultaneously, some aiming to grab Osborne's shoulders, others trying to kick his legs to force him to kneel and subdue him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately for them, their hopes were high, but their skills were lacking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dealing with such opponents, Osborne did not even need to activate his Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold snort, he instantly grabbed one man's arm, gave a slight pull and shake, and threw him out, crashing into the others and knocking them over as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "The power techniques Isa taught are indeed effective. I used very little strength, yet the effect was remarkable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was thinking as he kicked out again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Snap!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person who tried to kick Osborne's legs was intercepted. Osborne's counter-kick landed on the attacker's shin, causing it to twist at an odd angle with a bone-breaking sound that made everyone shudder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" A piercing scream echoed through the castle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! If you want to die, I will fulfill your wish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley, seeing Osborne dare to resist and injure several bodyguards, was not worried; instead, he was pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Osborne fought back, Wesley now had a reason to kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shoot him, kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley ordered without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Ophelia, standing behind him, changed her expression and wanted to </span><span>stop him but ultimately held back. She sighed as she looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Osborne, you have brought this upon yourself. Do not blame me for not saving you. In this situation, I can only side with Wesley; after all, he is my future husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blame yourself for being too arrogant without matching abilities."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia closed her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite everything, she had once been married to Osborne and had genuinely loved him. She did not want to witness his death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I would like to see who dares!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A crisp, commanding voice suddenly rang out, making the noisy environment fall silent instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd parted automatically, and a figure as beautiful as a fairy walked up slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Clarissa!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ashford family's bodyguards gripped their guns but dared not shoot, instead looking at Wesley for instructions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley's expression changed; he wanted to order the bodyguards to shoot Osborne immediately, but seeing Clarissa's cold face, he did not dare to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Damn that useless wretch! Why did he have such good luck with women? Austin stood up for him, and now Clarissa was doing the same!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley fumed internally but remained calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "As long as I accused Osborne of assault and attempted rape without eyewitnesses, Osborne could never clear his name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne became a pariah and a laughingstock in </span><span>Mayby</span><span> City, my goal would be achieved."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this thought, he sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Radcliffe, are you also defending a criminal who assaulted and tried to rape a woman in broad daylight? I know he saved your life as a child and is now your bodyguard, but given his actions, you should stay out of it to maintain your reputation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, the crowd began to murmur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That guy saved Ms. Radcliffe's life and is now her bodyguard? No wonder he is so arrogant and dared to assault someone at Mr. Ashford's wedding. He has Ms. Radcliffe backing him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Radcliffe is the eldest daughter of the Radcliffe family, the top beauty in </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>, a true goddess. How could she be associated with such scum?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Radcliffe's judgment is poor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I were Ms. Radcliffe, I would immediately sever ties with him and let him fend for himself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That scum deserves to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The murmurs reached Clarissa's ears, making her cold expression even colder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up, all of you!" she suddenly snapped, causing all the chatter to cease. Everyone looked at her in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne is not that kind of person!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa said through gritted teeth, then walked to Osborne's side under everyone's </span><span>shocked gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the midst of their astonishment, her cold expression softened into one of extreme gentleness. She stared at Osborne intently, then suddenly hugged his waist, stood on tiptoe, and quickly kissed his cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A loud commotion erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone, from the heads of various underworld gangs to the heirs of prestigious families, was stunned, staring in disbelief at Clarissa and Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "Clarissa had voluntarily hugged and kissed Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was happening?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Were we all seeing things?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or were we still half asleep? Was everything we were seeing right now just an illusion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Wesley and Ophelia were dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Clarissa and Osborne seemed oblivious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's face was now red with emotion, her eyes full of affection as she gazed at Osborne. Biting her lip, she threw her arms around his neck and stood on tiptoe again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her rosy lips moved toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne did not hesitate. He held Clarissa's smooth chin and gently leaned down, kissing her on the lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
