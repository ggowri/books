  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlett's Stealth Art was far more powerful than Osborne had anticipated. Even with his Satan's Eye providing early warnings, he couldn't pinpoint her location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was certain she was close, but no matter what he did, he couldn't uncover her precise whereabouts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this tense situation, Osborne hesitated to make any rash moves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He halted his assaults on Scarlett's Plant Realm, knowing full well that she was waiting for him to slip up. If he continued his attack, he would inevitably expose a flaw, and Scarlett would unleash a devastating counterstrike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her strength, she could easily land a crippling blow that could turn the tide of the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's senses sharpened as he braced himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he stopped attacking, Scarlett's Plant Realm began to recover, powerful vines lashing out toward him once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised an eyebrow, contemplating his predicament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>If I keep attacking the Plant Realm, I risk exposing myself. But if I don't attack, she'll just keep sending these vines at me! </span><span>Talk about</span><span> a tricky opponent.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne understood Scarlett's strategy all too well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here he was, in the open, while Scarlett remained hidden. As long as he couldn't uncover her, he would always be under her lethal threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "No wonder she's so confident! This Stealth Art is no joke. But I refuse to believe there aren't any weaknesses. I will find you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a scoff, he focused on defending against the vines while carefully scanning his surroundings, searching for any sign of Scarlett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "What exactly is her Stealth Art?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There are no spatial fluctuations, so it can't be based on spatial power. My Satan's Eye can't see her, and it's not just a regular invisibility."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sensed every faint energy ripple around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he defended against Scarlett's relentless vine attacks, he felt his strength rapidly depleting. If Osborne didn't find her soon and expose her Stealth Art, even if he managed to defeat her in the end, he would be too worn out to handle the challengers waiting in line behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pressure was mounting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His goal had never been simply to achieve a hundred consecutive wins; Osborne aimed to defeat all challengers and clear the Honor Quest Ceremony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't waste any more time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With no luck in locating Scarlett, he realized that his current methods were insufficient to break through her Stealth Art.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, there was one surefire way to counter it: his Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he unleashed his Realm, enveloping Scarlett within it, no matter how advanced her Stealth Art was, he would be able to detect her and lock onto her position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The problem was that his Thunder Realm and Spirit Realm were still only Level Two, which wouldn't hold up against Scarlett for long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could easily shatter his Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had only one shot at this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could he take Scarlett down in one blow?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't entirely sure, but he had to try. Otherwise, he would be stuck in this exhausting back-and-forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's do this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne made up his mind, quickly formulating his plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would unleash his Realm, lock onto the hidden Scarlett, and strike before she could dismantle his Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a risky move, but Osborne didn't hesitate for a second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a hum of energy, he activated his Spirit Realm, instantly covering an area of several hundred yards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within the confines of his Spirit Realm, his senses sharpened, and his mental strength surged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, everything within his Realm was under his control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any irregularity, any disturbance&mdash;he would sense it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne sensed something unusual 16 feet to his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Found you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile spread across Osborne's face as he launched into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlett realized she had been exposed the moment Osborne unveiled his new Realm. However, she remained calm; she had long suspected that Osborne possessed more than one Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anticipating this, she had already devised a plan to counteract his move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly darted away, commanding the Plant Realm to dismantle Osborne's Spirit Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she could just buy herself a second, Scarlett was confident she could shatter his Spirit Realm and vanish from his detection once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A second felt both fleeting and interminable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For true masters, a mere heartbeat could determine victory or death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Osborne caught wind of Scarlett's presence, he sprang into action. Taking a deep breath, he drew in the surrounding air, performing the Breath of Celestial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His already formidable power surged again, doubling yet again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay right there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne delivered a crushing kick to Scarlett's back, unleashing a terrifying force that erupted like a storm.</span></p><div class="pagination">
