I always feel that these </span><span>Originiums</span><span> are very important. We must snatch back the other two rare metal mines. And we need to stop them from taking the </span><span>Originiums</span><span> away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression was extremely solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The call with Godfather was very short. Godfather didn't know what Originium was, but he still felt something was wrong. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He </span><span>told Osborne that he would rush to </span><span>Dampston</span><span> immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, Osborne wouldn't waste time here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He killed the two Marquis Titans, grabbed Clarissa's hand, quickly tore the space crack, and headed towards the second rare metal mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne&nbsp;could interdimensional travel, and his speed was much faster than taking a plane. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his full effort, they arrived at the second rare metal mining area several hundred miles away in just a few minutes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He discovered that the members of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> here were retreating rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They are retreating! It seems they already got what they want! However, we can't let them leave like this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne attacked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This rare metal mining area was guarded by two Duke Werewolves. They had an excellent sense of smell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborn hadn&rsquo;t made it to the top when it came to the dark power. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he approached and wanted to assassinate, he was discovered by the Duke Werewolves in advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's assassination attempt failed for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't care. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chose assassination because he thought it was more efficient and could kill the enemy with the least effort.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That didn't mean he was afraid of the Duke Werewolves in a head-on confrontation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Duke Werewolves' attacks had stronger penetrating power, and their ultimate move, Death Claws, could completely break his defense and cause him huge damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that&nbsp;was all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Osborne's current strength, dealing with a Duke Werewolf alone would not consume too much energy. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After just a few minutes, he killed the Duke Werewolves at the cost of some minor injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Clarissa's speed was a little faster than his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dealing with the strongest Duke Werewolves, Clarissa and Osborne started their slaughter and soon killed all the strong men of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Osborne had a target and quickly found the second metal box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were also hundreds of </span><span>Originiums</span><span> in this metal box.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne put the </span><span>Originiums</span><span> into the Dimensional Space, and without any rest, he rushed to the third rare metal mining area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, this time, things didn&rsquo;t turn out the way he had expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The third rare metal mining area was now deserted, and there was no person from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned tightly, wondering if he&rsquo;d been there too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne suddenly felt a terrible force descending from the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Godfather appeared in front of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather was holding the black and gold Godfather's scepter, his expression </span><span>extremely solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time that Clarissa met Godfather. She was a little nervous. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the terrifying aura from Godfather, her body trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Clarissa was already a Class AA warrior at this time, and could even easily defeat Class AAA&nbsp;warriors, she still felt fear when facing Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly held her hand and soothed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather seemed to have noticed Clarissa's fear, and instantly restrained his aura of strength, becoming like an ordinary old man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled a</span><span>t Clarissa and said, "You are Clarissa, the </span><span>Fatebearer</span><span> of the Radcliffe family? Not</span><span> bad.&nbsp;You are </span><span>progress</span><span>ing very fast! When I saw you, I couldn't help but think of someone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, a trace of pain flashed in Godfather's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne&nbsp;immediately knew that the person Godfather was thinking of must be his mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivienne&nbsp;Augustine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mother, Vivienne, was extremely talented back then. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had already reached Class AAA at the age of 20. She was even more talented than his father, Theodore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Clarissa&nbsp;was also twenty years old this year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although her realm was not yet Class AAA, her strength had already reached that level. It was natural that Godfather would think of Vivienne&nbsp;when he&nbsp;saw Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of his mother, Osborne also bit his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather, I'm Clarissa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa finally calmed down and bowed respectfully to Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather smiled and waved his hand, "Little girl, you don't have to be so polite! From now on, we are all a family. You can call me Grandpa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until now, she still didn't know that Osborne was Godfather's grandson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne touched his nose, looking a little embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, I'll explain this to you later!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather, you should take a look at these </span><span>Originiums</span><span>! I feel that they are very special!
