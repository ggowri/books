  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Osborne's interference ruining their ambush plan, Vance and his five companions had no choice but to confront Harry and Amelia head-on, and the battle erupted with ferocity from the very start.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry was stronger than Vance, but only slightly so. They knew each other well; even with Harry's edge, it would take time to decisively defeat Vance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this scenario, Amelia was in grave danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Vance kept Harry occupied, he commanded his remaining five men to focus their attacks on Amelia. They all understood how much Harry cared for his sister; if Amelia was in peril, it would throw Harry into a frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Capturing Amelia could very well force Harry to surrender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You five are all Junior Deities, just like her! Even if her Divine Body is a bit stronger, she can't possibly handle all of you! If you can't even catch one woman, you might as well not be alive&mdash;just a waste of space!" Vance shouted, his voice echoing through the mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry's heart raced with panic. He attacked Vance with reckless abandon, desperate to finish him off and rush to Amelia's aid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Amelia! Be careful! Hold on a little longer! I'll take care of Vance and come to save you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Amelia was in no position to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was surrounded by five opponents, all Junior Deities like herself. Despite her slightly superior Divine Body, she quickly found herself on the defensive, unable to mount any counterattacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation was dire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this continued, she wouldn't last much longer. Soon, she would be overwhelmed and captured, leaving Harry vulnerable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight of this, Harry's anxiety mounted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more frantic he became, the more mistakes he made. He nearly fell victim to Vance's attacks several times while trying to reach Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! Harry, you're as good as dead today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vance laughed, relishing the advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued to taunt Harry, hoping to drive Harry further into a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it was working.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry repeatedly attempted to ignore Vance and save Amelia, but each time he failed, Vance seized the opportunity to inflict more injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, too, was starting to show signs of injury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The odds were stacked heavily against them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, hidden behind a nearby rock, watched with growing fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he felt powerless to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his current strength, he couldn't take on any of the Junior Deities directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he could do was warn Harry and Amelia to watch out for ambushes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It all came down to strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It all came down to strength! Without regaining his power, Osborne was left feeling helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne clenched his jaw, realizing he couldn't wait any longer. He had to find a way to turn the tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I jump in directly, I won't just fail to help Harry and Amelia&mdash;I'll put myself in danger too! If that's the case, I'll have to resort to this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination, Osborne quickly retracted the Eclipsing Mantra and unleashed his blood energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thick blood energy began to spread around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For ordinary cultivators, this wouldn't raise any alarms; in the heat of battle, Vance, Harry, and the others were oblivious to the shift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> lurking deep within the mine, Osborne's sudden surge of blood energy shone like a beacon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a distance, they caught a whiff of the life force emanating from him and wasted no time rushing toward his direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were hungry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They craved blood and flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Osborne sensed the presence of several </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> approaching from miles away. However, these were just Class S </span><span>Deathborns</span><span>; their numbers wouldn't significantly alter the battle involving Harry, Vance, and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not good enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I need to draw in at least a few Junior Deity </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> to really shake things up!" Osborne urged himself, intensifying the flow of blood energy within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each heartbeat, his blood energy surged further, spreading through the air like a vibrant signal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More and more </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> began to catch a whiff of life's essence, their instincts driving them rapidly toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The horde was growing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as Osborne realized something was amiss, it was already too late. A rush of </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> surrounded him, their numbers far beyond what he had anticipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His brow furrowed in alarm. "Damn it! I summoned too many!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One Intermediate Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, eight Junior Deity </span><span>Deathborns</span><span>, and over thirty Class S </span><span>Deathborns</span><span>!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They won't wipe out Vance, Harry, and the others, will they?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No. It doesn't matter! If this keeps up, Harry and Amelia won't last! I have to stir things up if there's any hope!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determined to act, Osborne activated the Eclipsing Mantra, effectively cloaking all traces of his presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> lost their ability to sense him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that was no longer the issue; Harry, Vance, and the others were fully engaged in battle, releasing their own life energy in fierce waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, drawn by the living essence radiating from the fighters, charged forward with unrelenting ferocity.</span></p><div class="pagination">
