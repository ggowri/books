  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad I didn't spot Scarlett or those two Class S assassins!" Osborne lamented with a hint of regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within a two-mile radius of the Lambert family's territory, he had located a total of fifty assassins from the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization. Most were hiding just outside, while a </span><span>few seemed to be scouting the Lambert family's defenses, preparing for the next assassination attempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These weren't just any assassins; each was classified as Class AAA at the very least.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weakest among them was far from trivial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fifty Class AAA assassins were capable of decimating many superpowers, and if Scarlett and the two Class S elites joined forces with them, their objective was unmistakably to annihilate the Lambert family without leaving any survivors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The assassins had completely encircled the Lambert family&mdash;no matter which direction they tried to escape, they would be met with ambush and death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Scarlett and the two Class S top-tier killers were nowhere to be found.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This could only mean one of two things: either the trio was currently employing Stealth Art, or they were beyond the two-mile perimeter, hiding somewhere further away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne leaned towards the latter theory; after all, Scarlett had just made a successful assassination attempt on Maia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her eyes, it was a clean job, and she likely didn't know that Osborne was able to recover Maia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their recent loss, the Lambert family must be on high alert, which meant that the assassins would probably hold off on their next move for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me take out these Class AAA lackeys first," Osborne muttered to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If anyone overheard him, they'd likely be dumbfounded. Class AAA fighters were top-notch anywhere one went.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In any superpower, they represented core leadership&mdash;a crucial backbone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in Osborne's eyes, they were just minor nuisances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he, too, was Class AAA, he had garnered enough strength to make such remarks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had dispatched over ten Class S foes, even if they were just clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet still, they were Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given his current capabilities, Osborne genuinely viewed ordinary Class S opponents as beneath him; he could rank comfortably in the middle tier among Class S warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the likes of Everett, the peak Class S, posed any real threat, and even then, it would take significant effort&mdash;and likely a hefty price&mdash;to take Osborne down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Locking onto an </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization assassin with a steely gaze, he didn't rush in with brute force; that felt too slow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he reached into the Dimensional Space and pulled out a handgun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A super energy pistol!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled coldly as he aimed at an assassin barely half a mile away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sniping was his strategy now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt a bit odd to use a handgun for sniping, but practicality prevailed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once I'm back, I need to get the Weapons Research Institute to redesign a super energy gun for me&mdash;make sure it looks like a sniper!" He paused, frowning at the thought of materials.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That reminded him of a nagging question: why were the League of Divine Descent and the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization so keen on acquiring the rare metal mines from the </span><span>Draco Group?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that besides the Divine Bone Crystals, there are other treasures hidden in those rare metal mines?" Osborne reasoned, feeling it was a strong possibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He resolved that upon his return, he'd instruct the materials research division to conduct a thorough analysis of all the minerals extracted from those rare metal mines. They might have overlooked something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for now, it was time to focus on the main event&mdash;killing first and pondering later!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been a while since Osborne had last used a gun. As his opponents grew stronger, the opportunities to rely on firearms diminished. Yet, his marksmanship hadn't faltered in the slightest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, with his enhanced abilities, his shooting skills had become even more terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the firepower, the bullets from his super energy pistol were forged from the divine power condensed within the Divine Bone Crystal. The potential of that power was something Osborne hadn't even begun to tap into.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could compress a single unit of divine power from the Divine Bone Crystal into a bullet, not even a top-tier Class S could withstand it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for now, using it to take down some Class AAA lackeys felt like child's play.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a mere flick of his wrist, he infused a tiny fraction of his power into the super energy pistol, activating the divine power within the crystal and swiftly forming a divine power bullet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he took aim and fired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bullet shot out with such incredible speed that it made no sound at all, effortlessly covering the half-mile distance in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It struck the hidden </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization assassin with deadly precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The assassin had no time to react; a gaping hole appeared in his forehead, blood, and brain matter erupting forth. He didn't even have a chance to scream before he was gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Osborne's control, the divine power bullet didn't explode upon impact, ensuring everything remained eerily silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile crept across Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forty-nine to go!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me take you all out, one by one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne squeezed the trigger again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One after another, the assassins were struck.</span></p><div class="pagination">
