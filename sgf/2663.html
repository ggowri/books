  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne felt completely refreshed. "I really broke through!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt that the joy of breaking through his cultivation level surpassed any pleasure in the world, even more satisfying than the intimacy between a man and a woman.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, the higher the cultivation level, the more intense and lasting this pleasure becomes. No wonder those with higher cultivation levels grow indifferent to emotions, caring less about romantic relationships and focusing more on pursuing greater power and higher cultivation levels.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne really wished he could experience this breakthrough feeling a few times every day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, that's impossible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though this is the Eighth Skyfall Casket, and even though he can devour part of their power to quickly enhance his strength after killing astral projections on the Ancient Battlefield, breaking through the cultivation level is still not easy for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne had reached Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection. However, if he wanted to break through to Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, he might have to kill all the astral projections within 124 thousand miles around him, and even that might not be enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, this would take a lot of time. After all, most of the time, Osborne could only directly kill these astral projections at the Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness level by using his strongest attack, Heaven Arrow, and that too when they were severely injured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And each time after using Heaven Arrow, Osborne must wait for a thirty-minute cooldown time before he can use it again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if he could use tenfold Time Acceleration to speed up the cooldown time, he would still need three minutes to cast it once.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Luckily, I've now reached Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection. My strength has grown. Now, even if I use Earth Arrow, I have a good chance of killing those severely injured, near-death astral projections. My speed in killing astral projections will be much faster."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes were filled with excitement. He didn't want to miss such a great opportunity to enhance his cultivation level and strength, so he immediately plunged back into the battle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sacred Power Arrows kept shooting out, killing one astral projection after another. At this moment, all the astral projections in the surrounding area had been completely wiped out by Osborne. Those endlessly cycling astral projections would no longer appear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Osborne continued his relentless slaughter, the cleared areas of the Ancient Battlefield grew larger, and his strength kept increasing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, far away from Osborne, Clara was also slaughtering the astral projections around her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her luck was much better than Osborne's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although she was also transported to the Ancient Battlefield, the astral projections fighting around her were not very strong, only reaching the level of ordinary Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara wanted to leave. But after attempting to kill an astral projection, she immediately discovered that she could absorb part of their power and quickly enhance her strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, she also began the slaughter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was currently only at primary Empyrean Sacredness. However, she could fight against those at advanced Empyrean Sacredness and even kill them. Through such slaughter, her strength and cultivation level rapidly increased.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While Osborne was still figuring out how to escape, she had already reached mid Empyrean Sacredness and was quickly striving to achieve advanced Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not far from her, Leroy encountered the same situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were lucky and were both teleported to the edge of the Ancient Battlefield. Around them were astral projections they could defeat, so they didn&rsquo;t have to flee like Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But some people weren&rsquo;t as lucky as them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, in the deeper center of the Ancient Battlefield, a person stood fearfully in the middle of the safe zone. The surrounding astral projections in battle were so powerful that he couldn&rsquo;t comprehend it. He felt that even the strength of a warrior at Imperial Empyrean Sacredness could never be this terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he was a warrior at Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, he didn&rsquo;t dare to leave the safe zone. He had already stayed in this safe zone for over five days.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He even felt that he would stay here until the Skyfall Casket closed and he was teleported away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, he didn&rsquo;t notice that new changes had occurred in the Ancient Battlefield. The recurring astral projections around him became different from before, and the battles also changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The once perfectly safe safe zone suddenly became unsafe. In the new battle scene, the aftermath of the fight between two terrifying creatures happened to reach this safe zone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a result, the warrior at Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness was instantly killed by the terrifying battle aftermath without even having time to react.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, not only him but many others who had been unlucky enough to be teleported to the center of the Ancient Battlefield and had been hiding in the safe zone realized that the safe zone was no longer safe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were terrified, screaming nonstop, but there was nothing they could do because they lacked the ability to escape or find a new safe zone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just like that, they were engulfed one by one by the terrifying battle waves and died on the spot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, with a loud boom, Osborne killed another astral projection. Feeling the powerful energy surging into his body, he smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Not bad! If I can kill another ten thousand astral projections, I should be able to break through Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection and reach Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection. It will only take me a few days to kill ten thousand astral projections."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was full of anticipation, thinking, "If I reach Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, even in a direct clash with a warrior like Ms. Alba at Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, I would have a good chance of winning. Even if I can't win, I won't lose."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes were filled with coldness. He thought, "If I can reach Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, I can easily defeat Frederick, who has reached Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness. Unless he truly becomes an Imperial Empyrean Sacredness warrior, I will definitely kill him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The opportunities and treasures in The Eighth Skyfall Casket accelerated Osborne's steps toward revenge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He originally planned to take revenge step by step, dealing with the weaker ones like Brent, Lorenzo, and Lilith first, then handling Hendrix, Naomi, Quinn, and Callista, and finally confronting Weston, and even Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, he might not need to go through so much trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought to himself, &ldquo;As long as I can reach Empyrean Sacredness</span><span> </span><span>Great Perfection, no one but Frederick will be able to stand against me. My revenge is coming, and it's coming fast. Just you wait.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne drew the Bloodwrought Bow, ready to continue the slaughter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that moment, his expression suddenly changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne suddenly noticed that the surroundings seemed to have changed, and the endlessly recurring astral projections had become completely different from before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Originally, a heavily injured creature from the Bug Clan was supposed to appear in front of him. But now, it had turned into a peak-condition creature from the Plant Clan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't defeat this peak-condition astral projection right now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned, thinking, "The combat projections on the Ancient Battlefield have changed. The safe zones around me have also shifted. What used to be safe zones have become dangerous, and places that were once extremely dangerous have turned into safe zones."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne's expression turned serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he felt a bit nervous, thinking, "The environment on the Ancient Battlefield can actually change. Even the safe zones can change. This means safe zones aren't always safe. Luckily, I didn't choose to stay in that safe zone earlier, waiting for the Skyfall Casket to close. Otherwise, I'd probably be dead by now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit scared but also somewhat relieved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, he felt a bit worried, thinking, "I just hope Ms. Alba and Clara weren't teleported to the central area of the Ancient Battlefield. Otherwise, they would be in great danger."</span></p><div class="pagination">
