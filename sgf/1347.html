  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "There's no need for such formality, esteemed members of the Prophet Alliance. After all, I'm still just a junior in this grand scheme.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We owe our success in taking down the Dark Deity Legion, the Pantheon League, and the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization to your assistance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Eddie and the others couldn't help but wear a wry smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's words were far too gracious; in reality, they hadn't contributed much. At best, they had managed to block a few enemies from escaping, while Osborne and the Blood Demon members had done the heavy lifting, eliminating nearly all the foes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it hadn't been for Osborne's timely arrival, they would have faced a grim fate at the hands of the traitorous Lord League.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a wave of gratitude, Eddie finally spoke up, "Godfather, what's your plan moving forward?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Eddie's question, a fierce glint flashed in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, we press the advantage! While we've wiped out the Superior Deities and Transcendent Deities of the Dark Deity Legion, Pantheon League, and </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, there are still many Intermediate Deities, Junior Deities, and regular members left alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need to eliminate every last one of them to restore peace to Blue Planet! Only then can humanity thrive and survive here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie nodded thoughtfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's exactly what we're thinking, Godfather! If there's anything we can do to help, just say the word. The Prophet Alliance may not match the strength of the Augustine family, but we excel at predictions, and we can certainly lend a hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll mobilize everyone in the Prophet Alliance to unleash their prophetic powers </span><span>during this time, pinpointing the locations of every member of the Dark Deity Legion, Pantheon League, and </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for taking them down, we'll leave that to you, Godfather."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in surprise. "You can use your prophetic powers to locate them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie smiled, "Unless they're significantly stronger than us, we can definitely track their positions as long as they're on Blue Planet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne exclaimed, relief washing over him, "That's fantastic!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was worried we wouldn't be able to hunt them all down, but with the Prophet Alliance's help, I feel much more at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's join forces and wipe them out together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely!" Eddie agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After chatting with Eddie for a bit longer, Osborne prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the Prophet Alliance could predict the enemy's locations, there was no rush to eliminate them right away. He decided to wait until the Blood Demon members finished their breakthroughs before sending them out to hunt down the remaining foes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Osborne had other business to attend to. He was headed to the Dimensional Microcosm of the Pantheon League.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've already sifted through the memories of the Superior Deities and Transcendent Deities from the Pantheon League, but I couldn't find any clues about my parents' disappearance. They've been clinging to life since the Age of Gods and only recently awakened, so they weren't involved in events from over twenty years ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ones who truly tormented my parents and know where they went missing must still be in the Pantheon League's Dimensional Microcosm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I need to find them and, while I'm at it, completely eradicate the Pantheon League!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought lingering in his mind, Osborne activated his interdimensional travel and swiftly arrived in Marcelin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, he located the Pantheon League's Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Pantheon League had no idea that their Dimensional Microcosm's anchor had long been discovered by Osborne, which meant they had not changed their location for concealment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To them, this place felt perfectly secure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the inhabitants of the Pantheon League's Dimensional Microcosm remained blissfully unaware that over a hundred of their Superior Deities and Transcendent Deity warriors had been wiped out by Osborne and the Blood Demon members. They continued their quiet training and daily lives, waiting for good news to arrive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this situation, Osborne stood before the anchor of the small world, his gaze fixed on it with a cold smirk on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For anyone else without the key, entering the Pantheon League's Dimensional Microcosm would be impossible without a full-on assault to shatter it completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with my spatial power and my space elemental essence at Level Six, I can personally construct a Dimensional Microcosm. Entering the Pantheon League's </span><span>realm unnoticed should be a cakewalk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Let's see what's going on inside first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne unleashed his spatial power, effortlessly locating the entrance to the Pantheon League's small world. Then, with silent precision, he slipped inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he crossed the threshold, everything opened up before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Pantheon League's Dimensional Microcosm was vast, covering an area of at least sixty miles&mdash;far larger than the Microcosm of the Augustine family. The scenery was nothing short of spectacular, boasting lush landscapes that looked like they belonged on a postcard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the heart of this small world stood a castle nestled against the mountains and beside flowing waters, a perfect blend of nature and architecture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within the fortified walls, a thriving population of at least 100 thousand resided inside the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of these people were descendants of the thirty-six Divine Families of the Pantheon League.</span></p><div class="pagination">
