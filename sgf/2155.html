  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Icy One and Icy Two exchanged rapid thoughts through their mental link, the battle raged on without a hitch. Their conversation was completely unnoticed by the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's voice turned icy as he declared, "God of Light, I'm done wasting time with you! Your existence has delayed the founding of the Malevolence Empire by a thousand years! Our patience has run out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you refuse to surrender, we'll send you on your way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light couldn't help but scoff at his words. "You think you can kill me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really have what it takes? If it weren't for the Ninefold Heaven's Tower, I would've wiped the floor with you already!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One chuckled darkly. "Oh, we absolutely do! I didn't want to resort to this method, but you've left me no choice. The losses we've endured are too great to ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, let me show you our ultimate move&mdash;crafted just for you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ninefold Heaven's Tower!" Icy One roared, channeling divine power into the tower with a fierce intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massive Ninefold Heaven's Tower erupted in a brilliant glow, spinning rapidly as Icy Two, Icy Three, Icy Four, and Icy Five joined in, pouring their own divine power into the tower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed of its rotation escalated, sending powerful waves of energy rippling outward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light's expression shifted from confidence to concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sensed an unsettling danger but couldn't fathom what kind of ultimate technique Icy One had up his sleeve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Preparing for the worst, she summoned the massive Sanctum of Light behind her, its radiant glow enveloping her in a protective embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ninefold Heaven's Tower spun at an alarming rate, whipping up fierce winds and radiating overwhelming energy that colored Icy One and his allies' faces with tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Light! Farewell!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ninefold Heaven's Tower!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Destroy her!" Icy One shouted, his voice filled with malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his command, the top layer of the Ninefold Heaven's Tower suddenly detached, hurtling toward the God of Light at breakneck speed, infused with terrifying power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light froze in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?! The Ninefold Heaven's Tower is breaking apart? The top layer is flying straight at me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, she felt a wave of pure danger wash over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With gritted teeth, the God of Light unleashed her power, transforming into a blinding sun of radiant energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fierce burst of light surged toward the rapidly spinning tower piece.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The explosion echoed across the battlefield, but her attack was shattered, the spinning tower piece remaining completely unaffected as it continued its relentless charge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was too fast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the rotating tower piece slammed into the Sanctum of Light's defenses, causing it to shudder violently, creaking ominously as if it were about to collapse. The protective shield blazed brighter, desperately trying to absorb the impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it wasn't enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The defenses of the Sanctum of Light crumbled under the onslaught, and the spinning tower piece collided with the God of Light, sending her flying through the air, blood spraying from her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet the spinning tower piece showed no signs of letting up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill her! God of Light, today is your last day!" Icy One shouted, his eyes glinting with triumph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light's expression shifted to one of horror as she realized the true terror of Icy One's so-called ultimate move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sanctum of Light!" she cried out, desperately summoning the power of the Sanctum once more, its light exploding around her in a final attempt to shield herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the spinning tower piece collided with the Sanctum of Light, the protective barrier trembled violently, its brilliance flickering as if on the brink of collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, against all odds, it held firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tower's relentless assault finally ceased, the spinning mass coming to a halt in front of the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Relief washed over her as she wiped the blood from her lips, her expression still tense as she regarded Icy One. "Icy One! Is this your ultimate move? Impressive, but it won't be enough to kill me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One merely smiled, a glint of malice in his eyes, "Oh, really? You think this is the end? We're just getting started! I told you, today is your last day!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce glare, he commanded, "Explode!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his shout, the previously still tower piece erupted in a surge of dark energy, its power coiling around it before suddenly collapsing in on itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next heartbeat, a cataclysmic explosion rocked the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top layer of the Ninefold Heaven's Tower detonated with a terrifying force, shattering the Sanctum of Light's defenses and sending shockwaves directly into the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was hurled back into the very heart of the Sanctum, the protective barrier crumbling around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that wasn't the end of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The explosion sent the Sanctum of Light spiraling into chaos, its structure fracturing and collapsing as it was violently thrown to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The earth shook beneath the impact, a deafening roar echoing through the air as clouds of dust and debris filled the space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, the world seemed to hold its breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even amidst the fierce battle between the Dark Deity Legion and the Human Alliance, all eyes turned toward the spectacle of the crumbling Sanctum of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shockwaves rippled through the ranks of both armies. The Dark Deity Legion erupted in jubilant cheers, while despair washed over the faces of the Human Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Sanctum of Light stood as a symbol of hope for the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as it remained intact, the alliance felt a sense of unity and courage to stand against the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with the Sanctum of Light shattered and the God of Light's fate uncertain, despair settled over the Human Alliance like a heavy shroud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The esteemed God of Light!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The esteemed God of Light!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The esteemed God of Light!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless Human Alliance warriors cried out, their eyes red with anguish as they screamed, desperate to believe that this was all just a nightmare. They longed for the sight of their God of Light, hoping against hope that she was still safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the Dark Deity Legion's laughter rang out, a cacophony of triumph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The God of Light is dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community is finished!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them all! Without the God of Light, there's no one left to stop us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fueled by their victory, the Dark Deity Legion surged forward with renewed ferocity, while the Human Alliance faltered, gripped by panic and despair. They began to retreat, their resolve crumbling like the very Sanctum that had once shielded them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tide of war had turned decisively in favor of the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the most terrifying realization dawned on the Human Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the God of Light defeated, there was no one left to stand against Icy One and his four Dark Sovereigns. Once they joined the fray, Peaks City and the Human Alliance wouldn't last long against their onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Peaks City is finished!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community is done for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're defeated..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
