  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bruno and the other chiliarchs wore expressions of shock, clearly taken aback by the unexpected choices on Osborne's list. They exchanged worried glances, their brows furrowing in concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, one of the chiliarchs spoke up, "Um, this might not be the best idea."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy chimed in, "Osborne, why don't you rethink this? The people you've chosen might not be the best fit. You have to understand that not a single one of them is easy to manage! Each one of them has been a headache for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He glanced down at the list again, his frown deepening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To him, Osborne's selections were puzzling&mdash;almost no one on that list seemed like a reliable choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Half of them were individuals who had ruffled feathers and, despite their impressive skills and significant contributions, had been stuck in limbo for years. These soldiers had been suppressed within the Wild Flame Army for so long that they had given up on ambition. Now, they just wanted to coast through their days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even when assigned to missions, they skated by, doing the bare minimum to get by. Their only goal was survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They weren't troublemakers per se, but they were far more troublesome than any rebellious spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least a rebel had some ambition; they could be honed into a sharp weapon if managed correctly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But these individuals had long since sheathed their blades, resigned to a life of mediocrity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Choosing them for his team would be like assembling a group of freeloaders who were content to eat and do nothing else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every centurion would dread having them on their roster, yet here was Osborne, picking them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If that were all, Guy would have had no qualms about approving the list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, he had long wanted to gather these slackers together and let them fend for themselves, preventing them from dragging down the morale of other members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, no one was willing to accept them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the real reason for his hesitation lay in the other half of Osborne's selections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those names were a different story altogether.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were all troublemakers&mdash;but not just any troublemakers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These were the kind with substantial backing and powerful connections. They hailed from the most influential families and factions, representing the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of the younger generation. Some were even heirs apparent to significant powers. Their status meant they would rise through the ranks quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Guy knew better than to offend them or assign them dangerous tasks. If anything were to happen to them under his command, he would be the one facing the fallout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, Osborne had included all these talented, elite individuals on his list!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy was baffled as to why Osborne wanted them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To him, they were merely individuals with a bit of talent but lacking the real-world experience that would make them reliable in tough situations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When the going got tough, the last thing he expected was for them to stick around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, maybe you should think this through again? None of these folks are easy to manage, and I'm already pulling my hair out! Plus, you're a member of the Human Community. If they're under your command, they could cause you a lot of trouble. They might not even take your orders seriously."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled calmly at Guy's concerns, saying, "Don't worry, I've put a lot of thought into this! It's precisely because they're difficult to manage that I want to pick them! After all, since you've been so supportive and respectful of me, I want to help shoulder some of that burden!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll take on the challenge of managing these troublemakers. If I can't handle them, how could I possibly deserve your favor, Mr. Guy Borden?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Osborne's resolve was clear, his determination unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had handpicked these individuals just for their strength and potential. They were among the best, distinguished by both talent and prowess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for the challenges they presented&mdash;difficult to manage, prone to coasting through life without purpose, resistant to orders, and backed by formidable connections?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't care less!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had never intended to manage them in a traditional way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His plan? Find the right opportunity to force them all into submission and transform them into the Blood Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once that was done, they would become his most obedient followers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wouldn't matter who they had been or what status they held; they would have no choice but to heed his commands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was precisely why Osborne had chosen them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy stared at the list for a long moment, a cruel smile creeping across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Deep down, he mused to himself, "I don't know what your intentions are, but why should I concern myself with that? Choose whichever way you want! You're going to be dead soon enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that thought in mind, Guy turned to Osborne and said with mock enthusiasm, "Well! You certainly haven't let me down, Osborne! You're already eager to take on more than you can handle! Since that's the case, I won't bother trying to persuade you otherwise. I'm sure you have what it takes to manage these people!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He then handed the list to Bruno.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bruno, make sure you notify everyone on this list. No matter who they were serving before, from now on, they're under Osborne's command. He'll lead them directly!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
