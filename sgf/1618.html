  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Riley and Emmett were both seething with anger, their expressions gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those damn Human Community members! How were they scouting? How could they not notice the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> lurking around?" Emmett cursed under his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Riley snorted in agreement. "Let's go! We need to catch up and see how they managed their scouting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With renewed determination, the group quickened their pace, trailing after Osborne and Diana. But now they were on high alert; eyes peeled for any sign of hidden </span><span>Deathborns</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne had turned his attention back to the path ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a pity. Emmett is tougher than he looks, surviving that first </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> attack. </span><span>But losing one guard isn't a total loss. If they want to play games with me, I'll make sure they pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, he signaled to Diana to keep moving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't see what had happened behind them, but she could sense the residual energy from the battle, her curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She whispered, "Osborne, do you think Riley and Emmett will be okay? The fight ended so quickly, and I have no idea what happened."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "I doubt Riley and Emmett will be in serious trouble, but I'm afraid one of those guards won't make it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana's eyes widened at his words, but she didn't press further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lost in thought, Osborne reflected, "Intelligent </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> are indeed formidable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> managed to kill a peak Celestial Deity guard right in front of Riley and then slip away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> here can disguise themselves perfectly and can shift into a spectral form, using the solid rock to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Lord Malevolence's Dark Deity Legion has spent over a hundred years without breaching a single divine peak!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They've suffered heavy losses each time. Here, </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> at the same level are definitely tougher than the warriors of the hundred clans. But if it were me facing them... they wouldn't stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Satan's Eye, I can see through their disguises! And my spatial power means that even if they turn to spirit form and hide in the rocks, they can't escape my pursuit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne felt a wave of relief wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For others, the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> near Divine Peak Nine was a nightmare, but for him, they were no different from those outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, their newfound intelligence and fear made them less reckless and more inclined to flee, which made them easier to handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still, my strength is too low!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I encounter a late-stage Deity Overlord or even a peak Deity Overlord </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, no matter how many tricks I have up my sleeve, I won't be able to handle them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I need to find a way to quickly boost my power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that determination in mind, Osborne resolved to relocate the Infinite Devouring Eyes from the depths of the No. 9 mining area to this location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The concentration of energy in this area was at least ten times stronger than in No. 9, and if he set up the Infinite Devouring Eyes here, it could voraciously absorb energy and rapidly elevate Osborne's level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once we reach the extraction zone, I'll find a safe spot to move the Infinite Devouring Eyes," he mused, his resolve solidifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, footsteps echoed behind them; Riley and Emmett had finally caught up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold it right there!" Emmett shouted, his voice laced with fury as he quickly positioned himself in front of Osborne and Diana, glaring at Osborne with palpable rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sensed what was coming and maintained a calm demeanor. "What's the problem?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emmett's voice dripped with disdain. "What's the problem?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you pathetic Human Community pawn! How did you manage to scout the area when there were Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> lying in wait, and you didn't notice a thing? You're useless! Do you understand that because of your blunder, I was ambushed and gravely injured? I had to use a Nurture Pill worth over 100 million Essence Crystals to recover! And now, because of your screw-up, we've lost one of our guards for good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emmett unleashed his fury on Osborne, shifting all the blame onto him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne flashed a condescending smile, his sarcasm thinly veiled. "Are you done? If you're finished, why don't you just get lost? You're the one who got ambushed and injured by the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, and you have the nerve to point fingers at me? I was the one scouting ahead&mdash;why didn't the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> attack me? They targeted you for a reason! Even the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> must see what a walking disaster you are.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And why should I explain how I scout? Since when do you call the shots?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just a liability I have to protect! If you think my scouting technique isn't up to snuff, then feel free to lead the way yourself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who says the one scouting ahead has to spot every danger? Are you barking orders at me? So seriously, just back off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne's outburst, an eerie silence enveloped the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one expected him to confront Emmett so boldly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
