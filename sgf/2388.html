  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Countless gazes were now coldly staring at Osborne, filled with anger, displeasure, disdain, and various other emotions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, murmurs and chatter arose.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sensed something was off and immediately opened his eyes, looking around at the crowd in surprise. Seeing their hostile gazes, Osborne was utterly confused.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't understand why these people were looking at him like that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I don't think I did anything, right? Could it be wrong to just rest my eyes?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was puzzled and carefully listened to the crowd's murmurs. He quickly understood and couldn't help feeling a bit helpless and somewhat annoyed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is he Osborne? The state </span><span>duel</span><span> champion of Zephyr State?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is he the one who bet nearly three million Sacred Crystals at the Phantom Commerce Guild's casino, wagering that he would win the championship? And he even said the other zone </span><span>duel</span><span> participants are worthless compared to him, and the zone duel championship is easily within his grasp?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph! He's so arrogant and cocky!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"All of us here at the zone duel are geniuses from our respective regions. Yet he looks down on us and thinks he can crush us to win the championship?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it! If the zone duel hadn't started yet, I'd want to go up there right now and teach him a lesson, show him how to behave!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's just the state </span><span>duel</span><span> champion of Zephyr State, he's nothing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since he looks down on us, he'd better pray not to face me when the zone duel begins, or I'll make sure to teach him a harsh lesson!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even top favorites like Valentino and Brenda don't act as arrogant as him. While they also bet on themselves to win the championship, they only wagered tens of thousands of Sacred Crystals, but he bet nearly three million?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He definitely looks down on us, thinking he's guaranteed to win the championship!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When I face him, I'll see if he's really that good!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd's discussion made Osborne understand the reason behind it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne..." At this moment, Leroy and Clara also found out and looked at him with great concern.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It must be the casino's doing!" Clara gritted her teeth and said angrily, "Because you bet too much. If you really win the championship, the casino will have to pay you over 200 million Sacred Crystals! The casino definitely doesn't want that to happen, even if they think you have little chance of winning, they still don't want any surprises."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, the casino deliberately spread this news, even exaggerating and smearing you, making you offend all the other contestants and anger them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In such a situation, these proud contestants will definitely target you intentionally during the zone duel, making it even harder for you to win the championship!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's the casino's goal!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They're deliberately drawing hatred toward you, making your chances of winning even slimmer!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara quickly analyzed the reason and felt extremely angry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded; Clara's analysis was pretty much the same as his thoughts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Phantom Commerce Guild's casino deliberately smeared him, drawing hatred toward him, making other contestants resent and target him, blocking any chance of him winning the championship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "What a despicable tactic."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt upset, but there was nothing he could do, let alone explain, because it was indeed true that he had bet nearly three million at the Phantom Commerce Guild's casino on himself winning the championship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he had never said that the other contestants were trash, nor had he claimed he could easily crush everyone to win the championship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But even if he explained, no one would believe him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These people already hated him and were ready to teach him a lesson when they encountered him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne couldn't help but feel a bit heavy-hearted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zone duel is a treasure hunt, and who ultimately wins the championship depends entirely on who finds more resources and treasures. Originally, he had Satan's Eye, and as long as everything went smoothly, he was absolutely confident he could find more resources and treasures than anyone else to win the championship. But now, an unexpected situation had occurred.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If in the zone duel, people keep causing him trouble, he won't be able to focus on finding resources and treasures, and his time will inevitably be delayed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "What should I do?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had no solution for the moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the crowd suddenly parted. A tall man slowly walked toward Osborne. He had a burly figure, but his face appeared very delicate, with features resembling a woman's, giving off a strange vibe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was Valentino of Rose Rebels.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time in the zone duel, he was considered the top favorite for the championship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are Osborne, the state </span><span>duel</span><span> champion of Zephyr State?" Valentino walked up to Osborne and spoke coldly. His voice, like his face, was delicate and sharp, almost like a woman's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without waiting for Osborne to speak, he continued coldly, "Was it you who bet nearly a million Sacred Crystals in the casino, wagering on yourself to win the championship? Was it you who disregarded all of us, thinking we're worthless, no threat to you, and would be easily crushed by you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, anger flashed in Valentino's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "You, a disciple of a Second-rate Power, got lucky and won the state </span><span>duel</span><span> championship, yet you dare to look down on us! Let me tell you the truth, in my eyes, you're nothing and unworthy of being my rival!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Arrogance will get you into trouble! Now, I'll give you a chance&mdash;kneel and apologize to all of us, and we might forgive you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Otherwise, once the zone duel begins, you'll become everyone's enemy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Valentino slightly raised his chin, looking arrogant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned deeply upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Originally, he wanted to explain a bit, but whether these people believed it or not, he couldn't care less. However, after hearing Valentino's arrogant words, Osborne's gaze turned cold.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Make me kneel and apologize to you? Or else I'll become a public enemy?" Osborne said calmly, "You represent everyone? Who do you think you are, worthy of me kneeling to apologize to you? If you think there's a problem with me betting on myself to win, then once the zone duel begins, feel free to come at me! If you want to teach me a lesson, use your skills, not just your foul mouth!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Valentino's eyes instantly grew angrier upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Very well! I had some doubts before that a piece of trash from a Second-rate Power would dare to be so arrogant! But now, I completely believe it! Remember your words! After the zone duel begins, I will come find you! I hope by then, you won't end up kneeling and begging me for mercy..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Afterward, Valentino shot a cold glance at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We'll see!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Valentino left with a grim face. Since the zone duel hadn't started yet, no matter how angry he was, he didn't dare to make a move against Osborne; otherwise, he would be disqualified from the competition.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the crowd around started buzzing again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne is so arrogant! He doesn't even take Valentino, the top favorite to win, seriously! It seems he really doesn't see us as a threat!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A piece of trash from a </span><span>Second-rate Power dares</span><span> to look down on all of us? Hmph, no need for Valentino to act; I'll deal with him myself when the time comes!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He is our public enemy now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If he wins the zone duel, it will be a disgrace to all of us!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
