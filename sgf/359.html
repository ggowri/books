  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hadn't expected that he could win four Class A- metahumans so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This battle was much easier than he had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And all this was because of the terrifying power of Illusion Projection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When metahumans fought each other, a small mistake could determine the result.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Illusion Projection could make them lose their minds in an instant and fall into illusions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that case, how could he not win?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at the four with a sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four were also looking at him in desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the dozen or so Class B+ men in black not far away immediately showed fear in their eyes when they saw that Osborne had easily defeated their four leaders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, they turned to run.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to run? Sorry. I've already sold you to Isa. Don't ever think about running away. Just be Isa's experimental subjects!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne's ocular energy flickered violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A huge spiritual wave spread out in all directions, projecting a powerful illusion into the minds of each of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Class A- metahumans couldn't resist Osborne's illusions, let alone those Class B+ metahumans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just an instant, they all froze in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled. His long, blood-red hair grew wildly, like vines, tightly wrapping around those bodies, piercing into their bodies, and suppressing their power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They woke up from the illusions only to find that they had been tied up by strange long hair. They could no longer use their power and were immediately horrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, they crushed the poison hidden between their teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched all this coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to commit suicide by taking poison? Sorry. That trick no longer works! You don't even have the right to commit suicide in front of me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, more than a dozen antidotes flew out of Osborne's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the control of ocular energy, those antidotes were accurately fed into their mouths. Those people, whose faces had turned pale after taking the poison, returned to normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leading lightning elemental metahuman fell to the ground. Seeing Osborne had actually stopped his men from committing suicide by taking poison, he was suddenly horrified and looked shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he crushed the poison between his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, it was of no use.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had the antidote prepared by Isa. These people had already lost their ability to fight. If Osborne let them commit suicide by taking poison, he might be useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said, you don't even have the right to die in front of me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, opened the lightning elemental metahuman's teeth, and made him take the antidote.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man felt that the poison had no effect, and his whole body began to tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Osborne angrily. "Osborne, who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Who am I? Don't you know me? What you want to ask is why I am so powerful, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man looked terrible and didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne walked up to him, stared at him condescendingly, and said calmly, "Are you the leader of the Ghost Ship? I'll give you a chance. If you answer my questions, I can make you die easier and less painful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, you will regret being alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader sneered, "Osborne, stop scaring me! I have lived for so many years. I am no longer afraid of death. Do you want me to answer your questions? You are daydreaming! If you dare, just kill me. Someone will avenge me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll wait for you in hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne coldly said, "It seems that you are not cooperating! Then don't regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he stared at the other three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you willing to cooperate with me? As long as you do, I promise to let him die quickly and will never torture him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three stared at Osborne with terrible expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to kill me, just do it. Stop talking nonsense! We admit defeat. But don't even think about getting anything out of us. We will never tell you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you kill us, you'll be doomed. Someone will avenge us. Even though you are strong, you will not survive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We are all waiting for you in hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the three finished speaking, Osborne became even colder. "It seems that you all choose not to cooperate! I can only use my means then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To be honest, I really don't want to do it. It's quite expensive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne took out a bottle from the Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a bottle of truth serum that Osborne had just bought. It was the highest-grade truth serum produced by the Draco Group. It was said that anyone apart from the master couldn't resist its efficacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its price was also costly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was 100 million dollars per pill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had bought ten pills. Even though he was no longer short of money, he still felt extremely heartbroken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the Draco Group was the Godfather's business, and the Godfather was his biological grandfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as he worked hard, the Draco Group would be his sooner or later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the four in front of him were unwilling to cooperate, Osborne could only use the truth serum on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered and pinched the chin of the lightning elemental metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're the leader. Let's start with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne stuffed the truth serum into the leader's mouth, who was horrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the leader's eyes became blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me who you really are!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
