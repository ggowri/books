  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad aimed for a top-ten spot and currently held one, so he wouldn't quit and give his points to Agatha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Agatha topped the strength leaderboard and Conrad knew he couldn't beat her, he had to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Losing meant forfeiting over 200 thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That would drop him to 9th or even 10th, and any more misfortune would end his top-ten hopes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Conrad had to fight hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want my points? No way, not even if you're Agatha! I'll take yours instead! Attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle started. Conrad was initially confident, thinking </span><span>he and </span><span>his four teammates would make it tough for Agatha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his hope quickly turned to despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha was far more powerful than he'd thought. Twelve Phoenix Skeletal Shields spun around her, an unbreakable defense. Their fierce attacks couldn't penetrate it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even their full-powered Sacred Artifacts couldn't damage the shields.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Phoenix Skeletal Shields were of higher quality than their Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that wasn't the scariest part. The real horror was when Agatha took out the Phoenix Cry Bone Flute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Conrad saw it, he knew they were doomed. He whirled around, ready to run.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was already too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The eerie melody filled the air, and in an instant, a strange force surrounded everyone nearby. They were frozen, their bodies rigid and faces blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the haunting notes of the flute swirled around them like a malevolent mist, the life force of Malcolm and his comrades ebbed away at an alarming rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One after another, they crumpled to the ground, utterly incapacitated, and left at the mercy of fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amidst the chaos, Conrad somehow managed to stay on his feet, though he teetered on the brink of unconsciousness. Within mere seconds, he finally succumbed, collapsing to the ground, rendered powerless to either fight back or make an escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With an air of nonchalant superiority, Agatha sauntered over to him. "You're no match for me," she sneered dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, over 200 thousand points vanished from Conrad's badge, arcing through the air like a streak of light before being absorbed into Agatha's, propelling her ever closer to Benson, who held the third place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pathetic. This is nowhere near enough," Agatha murmured under her breath as she turned on her heel and strode away, her eyes ablaze with a fierce determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, I'll seize the top spot and forge an insurmountable lead that will leave my competitors in the dust!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha set out in search of her next prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she came to an abrupt halt. In the distance, she spotted two alluring women who appeared to be eyeing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A swift glance at their badges showed that neither of them had amassed any points or tokens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha initially dismissed them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, what she craved were points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, a more scrutinizing look at the women made her change her tune, and she started striding towards them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These two women were none other than Clara and Leroy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Agatha drew near, their faces tensed, but they quickly regained their poise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since they had no tokens or points, there was no reason for Agatha to launch an attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, Agatha stood right in front of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sized them up from head to toe and then greeted them with a smile, "Hello! Are you two from Tempest Fortress City?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara and Leroy exchanged startled looks. Then they nodded in unison. "Yes, we're from Tempest Fortress City."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha flashed a smile. "Your battle suits bear the hallmarks of Tempest Fortress City's designs. That's why I thought I'd inquire, and as it turns out, my hunch was spot-on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two women were visibly perplexed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara broke the silence. "How can we assist you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha gave a nod. "I'm seeking information about someone, another contestant hailing from Tempest Fortress City."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two women were even more befuddled. "Who?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Leroy and Clara went stock-still at the mention of Osborne's name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their expressions shifted, and they exchanged a fleeting yet significant look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Could it be that Agatha killed Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara balled her fists, but managed to keep her voice steady as she queried, "Osborne is indeed from Tempest Fortress City, just like us! What do you want to know about him? What's your connection to him? Have you crossed paths with him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha hesitated for a moment, then nodded. "I've met him. As for our relationship, I suppose we're friends."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne is your friend?" Clara regarded Agatha with suspicion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't convinced.</span><br><span>If Osborne knows Agatha, why has he never mentioned her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She began to suspect that Agatha was the one who had killed Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha surely had the wherewithal to do so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara chose her words carefully and then asked, "If you're Osborne's friend, why are you asking us about him? What exactly do you want to know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha's face betrayed a complex array of emotions. Eventually, she said, "Since you're both from Tempest Fortress City, you must know him well. Can you tell me what kind of person Osborne was?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Clara was taken aback once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief moment of thought, she decided to drop a bombshell. "What kind of person was Osborne? Well, I know because I'm his teammate! But it doesn't matter now, for Osborne... he's dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Killed in the sixth layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara scrutinized Agatha's face intently, searching for any giveaway signs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was certain that if Agatha had killed Osborne, Agatha'd reveal herself upon hearing the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to her astonishment, Agatha's reaction was far from what she expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha responded instantly and emphatically, "Impossible! There's no chance Osborne died in the sixth layer! No one could have taken him down! Where'd you hear that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha stared at Clara and Leroy, utterly perplexed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two women exchanged another astounded glance. "How do you know Osborne didn't die in the sixth layer? It's all anyone can talk about!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha gave a calm smile. "Of course I know! I saw him just the other day. He's alive, doing better than anyone else around here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!" Clara and Leroy blurted out in unison, eyes wide with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seriously? You saw Osborne recently?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's not dead? He's really not dead? Are you pulling our leg? Where is he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two women were practically buzzing with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha frowned, clearly puzzled.</span><br><span>They're way too worked up. What's their deal with Osborne? They're obviously worried sick about him. Are they both his women?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha knitted her brow, thought for a beat, then said, "I can promise you Osborne's doing just fine! As for his whereabouts... sorry, if he hasn't spilled the beans to you, I'm not about to either!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He'll show up sooner or later, so calm down! Now, can you finally tell me what Osborne's like?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And... are you two his women?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
