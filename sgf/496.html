  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had disguised himself for so long just for this one attack. He unleashed his strongest power, aiming to kill Chris with a single blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that if he failed this time, he might not get a second chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris clearly did not anticipate such a situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even an experienced Class AA like Serena would be significantly affected after three attacks from him, losing much of her combat power and ability to retaliate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, being only a Class A, should have sustained even heavier injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Chris had no idea that Osborne was pretending. He was completely unaware that Osborne had not been injured at all from the beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne exploded with power, Chris was momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he tried to react, Osborne used Satan's Eye to project an illusion at him. Even though Chris was a psychic metahuman, he couldn't avoid being affected, experiencing a moment of confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he quickly recovered, Osborne's attack was already upon him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris found himself unable to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Osborne had also used ocular energy to firmly control his body, preventing him from evading.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Chris did not panic. Instead, he revealed a cold smile. He positioned the massive Death Sickle in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nice trick, but unfortunately, it won't work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I refined Stretch Soft Force, so you cannot break through my defenses and harm me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Chris could finish his sentence, he suddenly felt a terrifying power penetrate his defenses, piercing his body like a needle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris's body trembled violently from the excruciating pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face contorted as he roared,&nbsp;"You actually refined Point Blank Force, and you've already reached proficiency level. How is this possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked,&nbsp;"There's nothing impossible. Time for you now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After breaking through Chris's defenses with Point Blank Force, Osborne showed no hesitation and launched another attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, it was the Ninefold Tide Crash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His terrifying power manifested as nine tidal waves of attacks. As the force struck Chris, they merged into one, greatly amplifying the damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive blood hole appeared in Chris's chest. Osborne's fist had penetrated Chris's body, crushing all his internal organs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris widened his eyes, his face filled with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strong life force prevented him from dying immediately. He struggled to lower his head and gaze at the huge blood hole in his chest, his eyes filled with unwillingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I actually died at your hands? I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris's mouth bled profusely, and he no longer had the strength to grip the Death Sickle. His body collapsed with a thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne grabbed the Death Sickle and felt a strange power connect with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He showed a look of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This Death Sickle's power? I can actually use it directly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking this, Osborne sharply turned to Bruce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruce's face was filled with disbelief. He was originally engaged in battle with Clarissa, and although he had not used his full strength, he held an absolute advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no worries about Chris losing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew very well how bizarre Chris's attacks were and believed that Osborne had no chance of winning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially when he saw Chris quickly beating Osborne to the point of spitting blood and turning pale, he stopped paying attention to their fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until Osborne suddenly erupted and Chris let out a scream that he looked back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, he was too late to save Chris.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's attack had directly pierced Chris's body, shattering all his organs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris was doomed. No one could save him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruce was shocked and forcefully knocked Clarissa away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could you possibly be Chris's opponent? How could you kill him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, "Why couldn't I kill him? Now he is dead, and I am still alive. Most importantly, it's your turn next."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne swung the Death Sickle with force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mental attack struck Bruce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruce suddenly </span><span>spat</span><span> out a mouthful of blood, his face turning pale, and his spirit became listless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Osborne in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can actually use Chris's Death Sickle? What is going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne also didn't know what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After swinging the Death Sickle once, he felt somewhat spiritually weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder Chris's attack frequency wasn't high</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such an attack, while bizarre, consumes too much energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it is still very useful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and swung the Death Sickle toward Bruce again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruce spat out another mouthful of blood. His soul was torn apart, and his spirit became even more listless, his face filled with fear and shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can you actually use the Death Sickle repeatedly? Even Chris couldn't do that. Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Bruce spoke, he suddenly turned to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Chris dead and his soul heavily injured, their actions had already failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he didn't escape now, he would die too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wanna escape?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at Bruce's retreating figure, tore open a dimensional rift, and stepped inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, he appeared right in front of Bruce.</span></p><div class="pagination">
