  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity within Osborne stirred to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although it hadn't fully blossomed yet, it had regained 99% of its strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While it couldn't grant Osborne or his Blood Clan descendants immortality just yet, its remarkable healing properties remained intact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A vast surge of energy flowed through its roots, rapidly entering the bodies of Darren and the other warriors, beginning to mend their wounds at an astonishing pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Healing such a large group was a breeze for the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, a true Cosmic Treasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Its energy was beyond imagination, and its power was more than Osborne had anticipated. Initially, he worried that the destruction of Darren and the others' divine power essence might hinder the Lotus' ability to restore them fully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he soon realized his concerns were unfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The restorative energy of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was far more potent than he had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the group, many had lost their sight or limbs, yet they were now experiencing rapid recovery. Their gouged eyes began to regenerate, and their vision sharpened beyond its previous state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Limbs that had been severed were sprouting new flesh, growing back stronger than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And their divine power essences were also restoring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could feel the divine power fluctuations rising within their once-dry bodies, gradually intensifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As if awakening from a long slumber, Darren and the others noticed the changes within themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shock and joy lit up their faces as they realized their strength was returning!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The immense energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was not merely repairing their physical forms; it was converting into pure divine power, restoring their divine power essence and revitalizing their abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A powerful wave of divine energy erupted from the bodies of the 52 hundred warriors, reigniting the Divine Flames above their heads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The dazzling spectacle of rekindled Divine Flames was so brilliant that Osborne found himself momentarily blinded by the light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More and more warriors were reclaiming their peak powers, some even surpassing their previous limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This feels good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The warriors erupted in exuberant celebration, dancing and shouting as they reveled in their restored bodies, touching their newly grown limbs in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One hundred were restored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One thousand were restored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, as the sixth Divine Flame reignited above Darren's head, the overwhelming energy of a Deity Overlord burst forth. The injuries of all 52 hundred warriors healed completely, and their powers surged back to their former peaks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, they wept.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Five thousand two hundred warriors cried like children, their tears flowing freely. Even Darren, who had reached the late stage of Deity Overlord, was reduced to tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The hardships they had endured were monumental.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The defeat of the Pioneers of Starlight had left them as prisoners of war, reduced to nothing but shells of their former selves. The relentless torment they faced was almost unbearable, and their injuries felt insurmountable. To be treated as slaves, displayed like merchandise&mdash;it had all been too much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despair had long since settled in their hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had never imagined they would one day regain their freedom, let alone their strength. The thought of their severed limbs and blinded eyes being fully restored seemed like a distant dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, at this moment, they felt stronger than ever before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though the echoes of their pain lingered, they quickly regained their composure, their gazes turning toward Osborne&mdash;filled with fervor, admiration, and unwavering loyalty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment Darren shouted, everyone turned once more to honor Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you, my Lord!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you, my Lord!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a swell of satisfaction and waved his hand dismissively. "Let's drop the 'my Lord.' Just call me Mr. Lachlan Swift, or even better, just call me Boss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In unison, they exchanged glances before responding, "Boss!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded, surveying the crowd before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To his surprise, Darren had reached the late stage of Deity Overlord and was just a hair away from achieving the pinnacle of that realm. For Osborne, this was an unexpected delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even at full power, he might struggle to match Darren at this stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The strength radiating from Darren was unmistakably formidable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Beyond Darren, there were one hundred and twenty-eight Celestial Deities in the ranks, while the remainder were Transcendent Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This collective force eclipsed the Swift family, the top power in Wild Flame City, by a wide margin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the Swift family only boasted Walter as its single Deity Overlord, and he was merely at the mid-tier of that rank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their count of Celestial Deities barely reached thirty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Furthermore, Darren's group consisted of elite fighters&mdash;each seasoned in battle and perfectly synchronized in teamwork, with extraordinary innate talents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every individual among them possessed at least a Level Three Divine Body, with many hitting Level Four and some even boasting a Level Five Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These were true prodigies!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he took in the sight of them, a thought struck Osborne&mdash;a flash of inspiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They're over 52 hundred strong, while the Blood Demon has about 48 hundred members. Together, that adds up to a full 10 thousand. Talk about fate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He paused, a grin spreading across his face. "Why not merge them with the Blood Demon? It could be the perfect fit!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
