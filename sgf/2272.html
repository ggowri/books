  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy seemed to be descending into madness. With fierce determination, she lunged at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, sensing a drastic change in her power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More precisely, the Inferno Drake Lance was now radiating a fearsome energy that boosted Leroy's strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was something amiss; it was as if Leroy was losing touch with reality, consumed by a single-minded obsession&mdash;to kill Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't going to just stand there and wait.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had the advantage at the moment, and even though Leroy was getting stronger, he faced her with unwavering resolve. Osborne pulled back the string of his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow once again, firing arrows with pinpoint accuracy straight at Leroy, forcing her to scramble and defend against his barrage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leroy has lost it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, up in the stands, the top-level members of Azure Haven Academy watched with mounting concern. Apprehension was clearly written all over their faces as they witnessed Leroy's wild outburst on the arena floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela snorted, shooting them a sideways look. "You do realize that your Leroy has completely lost it, right? Why aren't you stepping in to stop her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Inferno Drake Lance, even though it's just a basic Sacred Artifact, is too much for her to handle! The power of that lance has gotten the better of her. It's eating away at her sanity! If you don't rein her in soon, she'll end up seriously hurt!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you guys just </span><span>gonna</span><span> sit around? When the hell are you </span><span>gonna</span><span> step in? She's got serious talent. Don't go screwing up her future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top-brass at Azure Haven Academy exchanged nervous looks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew how serious Angela's warnings were, but they hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them replied icily, "What's the hurry? Inferno Drake Lance has just lost control for the moment. Once Leroy takes out Osborne, we'll step in. We'll deal with the consequences and heal her wounds!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The champion of this city duel has to be ours! It's got to be Leroy! No one else can snatch this victory from us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela was flabbergasted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her laughter dripped with disbelief. "At this juncture, you're still going on about winning the city duel? You'll wait until it's too late after she defeats Osborne? Do you really think you'll be able to heal her injuries then?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How preposterous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The power of a Sacred Artifact is no joke. Do you think we in the Mystic Sirius Sect don't have our own Sacred Artifacts? We've kept them out of our disciples' hands during this duel for a good reason&mdash;we know that most disciples below the Empyrean Sacredness level can't handle their power. They could easily suffer a backlash and lose all control!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me make this clear. Once that backlash hits, the consequences are dire&mdash;it can permanently damage their potential and talent, effectively ruining their future!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yet here you are, allowing Leroy to wield a Sacred Artifact? You've already lost control of the situation and still refuse to step in? What on earth are you thinking?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela's scolding hit the leaders of Azure Haven Academy hard. Their faces showed a mix of shame and anger, but they were cornered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and Angela had jointly wagered twenty thousand Sacred Crystals in this match. If Osborne won, they'd have to fork out over two million Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a mind-boggling loss that could bring Azure Haven Academy to its knees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't let Osborne win!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giving Leroy the Inferno Drake Lance was a high-stakes bet to secure her victory. They thought she'd quickly overpower Osborne without facing any backlash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they'd misjudged him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had pushed Leroy to the edge, allowing the Inferno Drake Lance to turn on her and unleash havoc in the arena. As the pressure built up, Leroy was slipping further into madness, consumed by the fury and might of the weapon she could no longer rein in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this time, if they stepped in right away, Leroy would only face minor consequences. But if they sat back and did nothing, Leroy would definitely end up with serious underlying injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But could they really step in?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Intervening now would mean letting Leroy admit defeat, making Osborne the undisputed champion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that would mean they'd have to shell out over two million Sacred Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just hang in there a bit longer! Leroy, take him out! If you can beat him and stop him from seizing the championship, your sacrifice will pay off! Azure Haven Academy will always remember your contribution!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top brass at Azure Haven Academy decided to sit this one out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They watched the wild-eyed Leroy with bated breath, praying she could somehow wrangle the unruly power of the Inferno Drake Lance and take down Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absurd!" Angela exploded, her frustration reaching a boiling point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she was powerless; as a disciple of Azure Haven Academy herself, she had no authority to call Leroy off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, she turned to Osborne and shouted, "Osborne, finish her off quickly! She's lost control and can't handle the might of that Sacred Artifact&mdash;it's eating away at her sanity! If you don't take her down soon, she'll self-destruct!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Angela just couldn't stand by and watch a promising talent like Leroy get ruined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While she had no say in conceding on Leroy's behalf, she could at least urge Osborne to wrap up the fight quickly, hoping that the sooner it ended, the less harm would come to Leroy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Angela's words, Osborne couldn't help but gawk at Leroy in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Out of control?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No wonder she seemed off. Her power shot through the roof! She's lost hold of the Sacred Artifact and is getting consumed by its backlash!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's brows knitted together sharply in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't have any personal bond with Leroy; there wasn't even a shred of friendship between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Angela's plea left him with no choice but to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he kicked it into high gear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, Leroy's power had spiked because she'd lost control, but in Osborne's eyes, this Leroy was now a much easier target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, he vanished from sight and reappeared right behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, he brought his hand crashing down towards the back of Leroy's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Leroy reacted like lightning, swinging the Inferno Drake Lance </span><span>to ward</span><span> him off. The sheer might of that lance was enough to make every warrior under the Empyrean Sacredness level back off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Osborne didn't bat an eyelid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eclipse War Armor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of Sacred Power erupted around him, condensing into a fearsome armor that exuded an air of authority. He let the Inferno Drake Lance strike his body as he lunged forward, his palm landing with a thunderous thud on Leroy's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound echoed, resonating like a cannon blast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's palm and Leroy's Inferno Drake Lance landed on the target at virtually the same moment. Leroy let out a grunt and promptly crumpled to the ground, out cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simultaneously, the Eclipse War Armor shattered like glass; the overwhelming force of the Inferno Drake Lance pierced through Osborne's defenses, striking him squarely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gushing blood, Osborne staggered back, his face paling as the potency of the Sacred Artifact made itself known, even against his mid-level Infinite Sacred Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But luckily, Osborne hung in there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gazing at the unconscious Leroy, he wiped the blood from his lips and a triumphant grin spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd pulled off the win!</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
