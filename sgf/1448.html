  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin was furious, exuding an overwhelming aura that pressed down on Osborne like a heavy weight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin was a top-tier Celestial Deity warrior, so Osborne felt the pressure, but it wasn't as terrifying as it might have been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could easily withstand it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne knew that if it were "Lachlan," he wouldn't stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feigning discomfort, Osborne bent slightly at the waist, putting on a show of struggling against the oppressive force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, his words held firm. "Did I say something wrong? The Swift family is part of the Human Community, but what have we really done to change its situation? I've come to a realization&mdash;no matter how powerful we become, others will always see us as just another Human Community force. If the status of the Human Community doesn't improve, the Swift family will forever be a second-rate, or even third-rate, power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll always be targeted by the other races, and we'll never be able to stand tall!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's gaze locked onto Calvin, unflinching and resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words sent shockwaves through everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was he challenging the long-standing reputation of the Swift family, but he was also openly criticizing the entire clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was important to note that Calvin already had a high likelihood of becoming the next head of the Swift family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many major and minor affairs within the Swift family were now under Calvin's jurisdiction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin, a top-tier Celestial Deity warrior, was also Lachlan's uncle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With such stature and power, when faced with Calvin's reprimand, "Lachlan" not only did not cower but also dared to counterattack. In fact, he outright rebuked Calvin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This level of audacity left everyone present utterly astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Lachlan really losing his mind? Has he taken leave of his senses?" murmured some in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others said, "He's digging his own grave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whispers of incredulity filled the room as people exchanged glances, waiting to see how this would unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin's expression darkened, his eyes narrowing as he glared at Lachlan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you! Lachlan, are you accusing me? Accusing everyone in the Swift family? Such insubordination&mdash;have you truly lost your mind? If we don't punish you, how will we maintain order?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned to Walter, the current head of the Swift family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter's face was taut, but he managed to keep his composure. As a Deity Overlord warrior, he was accustomed to handling crises.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin bowed slightly, addressing his father, "Dad, I believe Lachlan has truly gone mad. He's not fit to represent the Swift family in the marriage alliance with the Gellar family! I propose we lock him in the dungeon for a proper reflection on his actions. We can easily select another capable young member of our clan to take his place&mdash;there are plenty who are just as worthy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, Dad, make a decision."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd turned their eyes to Lachlan, their expressions a mix of mockery and disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin was determined to strip Lachlan of his chance to marry into the Gellar family and to throw him into the dungeon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like Lachlan's future was all but over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this went through, he would lose any support from the Swift family and risk being cast out from the inner circle, reduced to an ordinary clan member.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers reveled in the drama, many young men particularly eager for the fallout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Lachlan angering Calvin, it was clear he wouldn't be marrying Hannah, and they saw their own opportunities rising.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Hannah might be physically challenged, marrying into the Gellar family would still offer significant advantages for their own futures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all eagerly hoped that Calvin could arrange for them to marry Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's attention was now fixed on Walter, eager to see how he would handle the "madman" Lachlan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At long last, Walter finally spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lachlan, you've let me down! I had high hopes for you, believing you to be the finest among my grandsons, which is why I arranged your marriage to Ms. Hannah Gellar of the Gellar family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But your behavior has sorely disappointed me. Consequently, according to your uncle's proposal, I think it best that you spend some time in the dungeon, reflecting on your actions. As for the marriage to Ms. Hannah Gellar, it will henceforth be none of your concern; I shall select another candidate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a dismissive wave of his hand, Walter continued, "Take him to the dungeon and keep him there for three months.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let him ponder his mistakes in solitude. I'll handle things with the Wild Flame Army."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a group of Swift family guards materialized, moving swiftly to Osborne's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They gripped his arms, ready to escort him to the dungeon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, brows furrowed, thought to himself, "While this scolding has resolved the Gellar family affair, freeing me from the prospect of marrying into their family, I'm now being sentenced to three months in the dungeon?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That won't do! It seems I must abandon the identity of Lachlan and start anew under a different name."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reflecting on this, Osborne offered no resistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He planned to use his spatial power to escape once incarcerated, adopting a new identity to begin his life afresh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A voice interrupted, belonging to a member of the Mystic Feather Clan.</span></p><div class="pagination">
