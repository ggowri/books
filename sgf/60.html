  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne didn&rsquo;t say anything else. He looked at Paul deeply and looked away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Tap! Tap! Tap!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Countless footsteps were heard, and a group of bodyguards dressed in the Radcliffe family security uniforms appeared and quickly surrounded the area.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna was also among them. When she saw Clarissa unconscious and being held in Osborne&rsquo;s arms, her expression changed immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Clarissa!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna nervously took Clarissa away from Osborne and was relieved when she found out that Clarissa had just passed out because of fatigue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She looked at Paul and asked, &ldquo;What happened? How did she faint?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul reacted quickly and started his story.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Here is what happened&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In Paul&rsquo;s narration, there was little content about Osborne saving Clarissa. It was all about himself&mdash;things like how he acted bravely and protected Clarissa at all costs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne, instead, became the drag.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul said Clarissa fainted because Osborne was not strong enough to deal with the enemy&rsquo;s attack, forcing Clarissa to use her powers to save Osborne again and again and recover from his injuries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;This is what happened. This is also my fault. Osborne was unwilling to cover us, so I had to do it myself and asked Osborne to take Ms. Radcliffe to the safe house. However, there were enemies hiding near the safe house, and I was stopped by the gunmen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;If I were here, those enemies wouldn&rsquo;t be able to hurt Ms. Radcliffe at all, and she wouldn&rsquo;t have fainted.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul said this with an apologetic look on his face, and then he looked at Osborne threateningly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna&rsquo;s expression relaxed, and she looked at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Osborne, is he telling the truth?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne laughed, not caring about Paul&rsquo;s threat nor seeking credit for what he had done.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You can ask everything after Ms. Radcliffe wakes up. But&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne pointed at Paul all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I have already reminded him that enemies were lying in ambush, but he did not listen and insisted on bringing Ms. Radcliffe here. Therefore, I have reason to suspect that he is in cahoots with the killers. Maybe he is a spy.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Silence fell after Osborne finished his sentences.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then all the Radcliffe family bodyguards present burst into laughter as if they had heard a joke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even Donna shook her head, not knowing what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul looked at Osborne with disdain and snorted coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne frowned. He was confused by their reaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What was going on?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;No matter what, you were part of protecting Clarissa. I will not forget your contribution. I now declare that you can stay in the Radcliffe family and be Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;But, you said that Captain Paul was a spy. That&rsquo;s too much. Others may be spies, but not him. He will never betray the Radcliffe family.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna waved her hand without giving Osborne a chance to continue speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Well, the enemy has retreated, but there are still many things to deal with. These two, Wesley and Ophelia, are dying&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ophelia is dying?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was stunned, and complicated feelings flooded his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When the attack happened, a metahuman controlled lightning to bombard the platform. Although Ophelia and Wesley were not hit directly, they were both ordinary people and were seriously injured and fainted in an instant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If Wesley died, Osborne would not feel anything, and might even think that he deserved it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Ophelia&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was his ex-wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They were a couple once. Although Ophelia divorced him because of her ambition and even looked down on him and treated him as if he was garbage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But that didn&rsquo;t mean he wanted to watch her meet her end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hearing that she was going to die, Osborne couldn&rsquo;t help but sigh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Let me take a look at her for the last time.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Not long after, Osborne saw Ophelia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia was lying on the ground. Her pretty face was sickly pale. Blood was oozing from her ears and nose, and she was barely breathing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Radcliffe family&rsquo;s doctor had examined her, and there was no need for emergency treatment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Is she going to die just like that?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne murmured, feeling the fragility of life for the first time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I can save her.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this moment, a weak voice sounded from behind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne turned his head and saw Clarissa come with Donna. Donna was helping her walk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Though Clarissa still looked weak, she almost recovered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Clarissa, you have overused your powers. It is not appropriate to use them at this time. Their injuries are too severe. Forcibly treating them will be harmful to you,&rdquo; Donna said with a frown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;They are just two heirs to wealthy families. I will give their families sufficient compensation on behalf of the Radcliffe family.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa shook her head and ignored Donna. Instead, she said to Osborne, &ldquo;Os&hellip; Mr. Augustine, they came with you. Do you want me to save them?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa almost called out his name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Fortunately, she reacted in time and prevent others from knowing anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Was there still hope for Ophelia?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Could Clarissa&rsquo;s special power save them?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Did he want Clarissa to save her?</p><div class="pagination">
