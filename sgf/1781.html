  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Quick! Get your defenses up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Orson's voice rang out in a desperate shout as he felt an overwhelming sense of impending doom. Divine power surged around him, forming a protective barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had been far too confident, believing that defeating Anastasia would be a walk in the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They hadn't even considered the need for defense until it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, as the storm of lightning descended, it was evident they were in over their heads. Anastasia's lightning elemental essence had reached the pinnacle of Level Eight, and this was no ordinary lightning; it was a terrifying force that even Osborne feared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Orson's own Thunder Power paled in comparison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the blink of an eye, a torrent of blinding lightning engulfed Orson and the other seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was akin to an amplified Deity King Tribulation, and the ferocious bolts crashed down upon them with relentless fury. Their hastily erected defenses crumbled like paper, leaving them utterly exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ahhh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The air was filled with piercing screams as their Divine Bodies blackened, charred by the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Horrific wounds marred their skin, leaving them looking like burnt remnants of what they once were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At last, the storm subsided, leaving the arena eerily calm, as if the chaos had never happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But amidst the stillness, only Anastasia remained standing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Orson, Stellan, and the others lay sprawled on the ground, unconscious, their bodies scorched and lifeless, barely clinging to the faintest spark of life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Silence enveloped the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Outside the ring, thousands of Ultimate Malevolence Airships hovered overhead alongside dozens of Supreme Malevolence Airships. A crowd of over a million watched in stunned disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sight before them was surreal&mdash;Orson, Stellan, and the others, once proud geniuses, now reduced to ashen figures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had lost!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vivienne, a solitary figure from the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, had taken on Orson and Stellan's formidable team. Everyone had thought she was out of her mind, that she was walking straight into her own demise. Yet, the reality was far from it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a single strike, she shattered their combined attack and, without missing a beat, sent them crashing down, leaving them on the brink of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If not for their Deity King status and their tenacious life force, they would have already crossed the threshold into oblivion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vivienne's lightning assault had left the spectators' nerves frayed, their heads spinning with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The silence lingered, thick and heavy, until finally, a frail figure darted onto the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An elderly man rushed to Orson's side, lifting him gently and quickly shoving a healing pill into his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Orson's feeble breath began to stabilize, a flicker of life igniting within him once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The elder glared furiously at Anastasia, his voice icy with rage. "Damn it, you little brat from the Human Community! How dare you strike so ruthlessly! Are you looking for death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An overwhelming aura of murderous intent radiated from him, pressing down on Anastasia like a heavy weight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, she simply snorted, unfazed by his fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This elder was a high-ranking member of the Thunderstorm Drake Clan, a formidable Deity King in the late stages of his power. But Anastasia had already reached the mid-stage of Deity King herself, and she showed no fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anastasia replied coolly, disdain dripping from her words, "What's the matter? Can't the Thunderstorm Drake Clan handle a little defeat? Your young trash can't even stand up to me, and now the older generation wants to step in?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If that's the case, then there's no point in holding this challenge at all! Just admit that your young talents are nothing but worthless trash, unable to match up to the Seven Young Deity Kings of the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you old-timers want to fight instead, then bring it on! We're not afraid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Anastasia finished speaking, lightning crackled around her, a fierce display of power as she stood her ground against the elder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The elder's face shifted from red to white, a storm of fury brewing inside him. He longed to retaliate against Anastasia, but pride held him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, he was a seasoned Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was merely the first match of the tournament. If he, an elder, had to intervene, it would only make it seem like the younger generation was utterly useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Ambrose stepped in, addressing the elder with a calm but firm tone, "Stand down! Don't worry, Vivienne is strong, but we can handle this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His expression was cold as he turned to Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Vivienne, I didn't realize you had already reached mid-stage Deity King! Beating eight early-stage Deity Kings isn't something to brag about. Our young talents won't be defeated by you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Ambrose glanced at the eight fighters lined up behind him, their faces pale with apprehension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were aware that their strength was on par with Orson's team, and now, as they faced Anastasia, doubt and fear clouded their expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ambrose said, "I'll take this one!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
