  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This tunnel is definitely off! We've gone 30 miles into the mine and haven't run into a single </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>! If we stake our claim here, we'll have a steady stream of Essence Crystals coming our way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Soon enough, we could become Superior Deities&mdash;maybe even Transcendent Deities! Just think about it! With enough power, we could join the Ninth Dark Deity Legion as warrior recruits, becoming real soldiers of the Dark Deity Legion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Captains, centurions, or even generals&mdash;it's all within reach! That'll make us the true players in this game!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vance's eyes glinted with malice as he watched Harry and Amelia diligently mining in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of eliminating them filled him with dark excitement. If he could just get rid of Harry and Amelia, this secret passage would belong to him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lowered his voice to rally the five men behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get ready to strike!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When the moment comes, I want you all to unleash everything you've got. If this goes smoothly, you'll be handsomely rewarded. Once I'm the overseer, you'll all be my trusted aides. I'll make sure you rise to overseers, too, holding power over others' lives!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if any of you hold back or mess this up, just know I, Vance, have my ways of making you wish you hadn't crossed me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vance's words were venomous, and the other five men exchanged steely glances, their eyes burning with cold resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Vance. We won't let you down. Together, we'll make sure Harry and Amelia never see what hit them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You got it. They don't stand a chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vance nodded, satisfied. "Alright, let's move in closer. Once we're in striking distance, we'll plow through Harry first!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for his sister Amelia... Heh, you know why she always looks so grimy with that layer of dirt on her face? It's because she's too pretty! She's afraid someone will discover her true beauty, so she intentionally plays the ugly duckling!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's a total knockout, trust me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only I know this&mdash;didn't even spill the beans to Patrick because if I had, she'd already be under his thumb! But once we take down Harry, she'll be ours!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After I'm done with her, you guys can have your way with her too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, the five men's faces lit up with excitement and lustful anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a sound, the six men crept closer, ready to strike like lightning the moment they were in range to ambush Harry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Harry was an Intermediate Deity with a Level Three Divine Body, significantly stronger than Vance's Level Two, their numbers gave them an edge. If they all attacked together, they could seriously hurt Harry&mdash;or even kill him outright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Harry had no inkling that anyone would dare to ambush them in such a hidden tunnel. After all, </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> weren't known for their cunning; they preferred to charge in loud and brash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Harry had no defense against the impending ambush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Vance's group silently advanced closer to their target, Osborne knew it was time for him to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given his current strength, taking on any one of Vance's crew would be tough, and he couldn't physically stop them from attacking Harry and Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was one thing he could do: prevent their ambush from succeeding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a cold snort, unleashing a subtle wave of divine power that shot straight toward one of the men behind Vance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man felt a sharp prick, like a needle jabbing into his skin, and couldn't help but gasp in pain, a look of fury crossing his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That slight cry echoed through the vast emptiness of the mine, cutting through the silence like a knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia, busy at their work, immediately looked up, their expressions </span><span>shifting from concentration to alarm as they turned toward the source of the sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vance's face hardened as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when they were about to reach the perfect ambush point, one of his men had made a noise loud enough to alert Harry and Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You useless fool, I'll deal with you later!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attack! We need to take down Harry now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Vance sprang into action, his divine power erupting like a volcano as it surged toward Harry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vance! You filthy bastard! You've been tailing us, and now you want to ambush us?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've crossed the line, Vance! You really think I won't kill you just because we grew up in the same village?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Harry retaliated, unleashing his own power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vance gritted his teeth, fury boiling beneath the surface. "Harry, who lives and who dies is still up for debate! You and your sister are going to die here today! This secret mine will be mine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And trust me, I'll take you out first, then enjoy every moment of your sister's beauty! I want to hear her moan and scream beneath me! Hahaha!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is what happens when you cross me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Prepare to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thunderous roar, the narrow mine erupted into chaos as fierce combat broke out.</span></p><div class="pagination">
