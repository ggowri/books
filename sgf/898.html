  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arena was alive as Osborne and Bradley engaged in a fierce and direct clash, their punches landing with bone-crushing force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spectators below were utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the Honor Quest Ceremony had begun, Bradley was the only challenger capable of going toe-to-toe with Osborne. Most challengers couldn't even withstand a single blow from Osborne, whose strength was legendary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here was Bradley, not only holding his ground but seemingly gaining the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was going all out. He had transformed into a Vampire and had unleashed the Breath of Celestial, pushing his power to its limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet somehow, Bradley was still overpowering him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The faces of those from various superpowers turned grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that Bradley's strength alone couldn't account for this. The real reason behind his newfound power was the pill he had consumed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless whispers filled the air as people speculated about the nature of that pill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they could get their hands on something like that, it could mean the difference between life and death in a critical moment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne and Bradley broke apart, Bradley was flushed with excitement while Osborne's face paled, a trickle of blood seeping from the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He watched Bradley with a serious expression, thinking, "Bradley's strength is still increasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That pill's power hasn't been fully released yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm losing out in this direct confrontation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His power and defense have skyrocketed. This is beyond what a Class AAA elite should be capable of. It's downright monstrous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most worryingly, this kind of brute-force combat is draining my energy fast. I've already lost ten percent of my strength in just this short exchange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this rate, even if I manage to defeat Bradley, I won't have enough left to face Marlon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clenching his teeth, Osborne resolved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, he charged in again, but this time, he didn't engage Bradley head-on. Instead, Osborne decided to unleash his Explosive Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "If Bradley's strength and defense are so formidable, I'll break through from within!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne concentrated his </span><span>Point Blank</span><span> Force into a single point, piercing through Bradley's defenses and sending a surge of energy into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, an explosion of power detonated within Bradley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a grunt, blood seeping from his mouth as shock registered on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bradley growled, his expression darkening, "Damn it! You've got a trick up your sleeve?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you think that's enough to take me down? Dream on! I took the Number Six Elixir. Not only does it boost my strength and defense tenfold, but it also provides a powerful shield for my internal organs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your little attacks won't hurt me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Bradley charged again, determined to crush Osborne with sheer force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne unleashed his Explosive Force repeatedly, but as Bradley had claimed, the </span><span>divine power coursing through him protected his insides. While Osborne's attacks had some effect, they weren't enough to bring Bradley down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne could feel his strength rapidly depleting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he kept this up, even if he managed to defeat Bradley, he would be left utterly drained and vulnerable against Marlon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression grew increasingly serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured, "Looks like I have no choice but to reveal my ultimate move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Light Realm was Osborne's secret weapon, a Level Four Realm whose true power he still didn't fully understand. He had intended to save it for Marlon, perhaps even to surprise Isa, but it seemed he had no choice but to use it now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he didn't act quickly, defeating Bradley would become an uphill battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bradley sneered, saying, "Your ultimate move? Come on, Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What else do you have up your sleeve? No matter how hard you struggle, you're destined to lose to me today. In the face of absolute power, all your tricks will just seem laughable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, a mocking grin on his face,</span><span> "Oh, really?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't you give it a shot?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Osborne prepared to unleash Light Realm. But in that instant, he felt a sudden surge from the Blood Cross within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A powerful pull erupted from the Blood Cross, catching Bradley off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he found himself unable to move. Crimson tendrils appeared across his skin, so fine they seemed to shimmer. They </span><span>converged</span><span> into a single droplet of blood, which the Blood Cross eagerly absorbed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the Blood Cross consumed that drop, it settled back into calmness. But Osborne could distinctly feel a thread of divine power emanating from it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the infusion of that divine blood, the Blood Cross seemed to pulse with newfound vitality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Bradley felt himself grow weaker by the second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face turned pale, and his body began to tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible? The power from the Number Six Elixir... it's just gone? This can't be happening! The Number Six Elixir is made from the blood of a Vampire deity..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He trailed off, suddenly silenced by the shocking turn of events.</span></p><div class="pagination">
