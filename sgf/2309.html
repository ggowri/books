  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An inferno erupted around Osborne, but this was no ordinary fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not red, not blue&mdash;black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Black flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the...? A Dark Phoenix?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's startled cry echoed in Osborne's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eyes still closed, Osborne marveled at the heat swirling around him, feeling an unexpected warmth. These black flames embraced him, sparking a bizarre sense of comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snapped his eyes open, jolted by Primordial's shout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the flames receded, shrinking into a tiny ember that pulsed steadily within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dark Phoenix? What's that supposed to mean? Is something wrong?" Osborne asked, utterly bewildered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial took a long, slow breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You lucky son of a gun! Turns out this girl's got a trace of ancient Dark Phoenix blood, and she didn't even know it! And you just went and triggered it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dark Phoenixes are right up there with Apex Clans like the Sacred Dragon and Tiger! Shame they died out ages ago. Who knew this chick had a sliver left, and you just happened to awaken it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was floored. "So... this is a good thing for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial puffed out his chest, grinning. "Good thing? Hell yeah!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've ignited Phoenix Flame&mdash;and not just any Phoenix Flame, but the most badass kind&mdash;the Flames of the Dark Phoenix! Top it off, you're a dark power specialist, so it's a match made in hell! Soon, when you fuse your fire power, your Sacred Power is gonna be off the charts! We're talking messed-up corrosive abilities courtesy of the Dark Phoenix Flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your divine power already had a corrosive kick to it, thanks to that Bloodstrike Orb. Nasty stuff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But compared to the corrosion from the Flames of the Dark Phoenix, the Bloodstrike Orb's corrosion is chump change!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, unless someone's way stronger than you, anyone who gets hit by your Sacred Power is screwed six ways to Sunday!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's words made Osborne grin from ear to ear. "So, I guess this is what they mean by karma, huh? If I hadn't saved her, I might have nabbed her two Sacred Artifacts, but I wouldn't have ignited the Dark Phoenix Flame."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial nodded. "Your luck's insane! You're one of those guys that good stuff just happens to!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But... it's not all one-sided. That girl's getting a sweet deal too! Actually, she's the one who hit the jackpot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? How's that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial explained, "Because when you ignited the Flames of the Dark Phoenix, that tiny sliver of Dark Phoenix blood in her woke up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, she is a Dark Phoenix!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dark Phoenixes are the top dogs of all the Ember Phoenix Clan groups. Rumor had it they were all extinct! But now that her bloodline's awakened, a Dark Phoenix will rise again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But she hasn't ignited her Flames of the Dark Phoenix yet! Once she does... you might not stand a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm telling you, ice her now! One less rival to worry about."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes. "Come on! Her getting stronger is her destiny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not gonna kill her just because she might become powerful. What kind of a jerk would that make me? What's the difference between me and some wannabe supervillain?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne then stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Frost-kissed Heart's power had completely dissipated around Agatha. With her Dark Phoenix bloodline activated, she was undergoing some kind of wild transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mountaintop's icy chill was no longer a threat to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd be waking up soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's bounce! We're going to the other side of the snow mountain to look for those Frost-kissed Hearts!" Osborne turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial spoke up, scratching his head, "Aren't you gonna stick around 'til she wakes up? I mean, you saved her life. Shouldn't you at least let her know it was you? Or are you just planning on doing a drive-by good deed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne just smirked. "Why does doing something nice always have to come with a shout-out? Besides, when she comes to, she might not even be grateful. She might just try to off me! Not everyone's sunshine and rainbows. She's packing some serious heat, and I'd rather not get dragged into a random throwdown!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'd rather spend the time hunting down that Frost-kissed Heart! Time's ticking, and today's already day four of the state duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got, like, two days tops before I gotta bail and head back to the Arctic Maw Chasm's first layer, or I'm toast in the state duel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My sights are set on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel! I can't let myself get knocked out here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne glanced at Agatha, making sure she was alright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he booked it off the mountaintop and headed towards the far side of the snow mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over there, the wind howled like a banshee, and the temperature had plummeted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne didn't feel a thing. He channeled the Flames of the Dark Phoenix inside him, basking in their cozy warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even without the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, he could stroll around this snow mountain like it was a beach. The terrifying icy power just bounced right off him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stoked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The benefits of igniting those Flames were already showing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Now that I've got the Flames of the Dark Phoenix, should I go check out the Arctic Maw Chasm's eighth layer? There's gotta be a ton more Frost-kissed Hearts down there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial warned sharply, "Wouldn't advise it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even though I have no clue what the eighth layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm is like, I know that even with the Dark Phoenix Flames, you'll have a rough time surviving! Your cultivation level's just too low. You're only an Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That head judge, Rupert, said even he can't survive in the eighth layer for long! And that guy's way stronger than you! Even with those flames, going to the eighth layer with your current strength is practically suicide!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And... the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity's immortality might not even be able to bring you back there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's warning wiped the smile off Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally nodded. "Alright! I won't risk it! I'll wait until I'm stronger and check it out if I get the chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne continued his search on the snow mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The frigid side teemed with </span><span>more </span><span>Frost-kissed Hearts. The instant Osborne glimpsed them, his eyes flashed with avarice. All distractions fled as he became a tenacious hunter, zeroing in on the prize like a hound on a scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbeknownst to him, shortly after he left the mountaintop, Agatha's body twitched, and her eyes fluttered open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were radiating an eerie, chilling light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat there for a long while before slowly rising to her feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gazing in the direction Osborne had gone, she muttered, "Osborne? I didn't expect someone like him to be lurking in the state duel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he hadn't shown up, I would've been a goner! And he actually ignored that little tree dude's suggestion and didn't wait for me to kick the bucket so he could swipe my Phoenix Cry Bone Flute and Phoenix Skeletal Shield. Instead, he chose to save me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I owe him a life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But he stole nine drops of my Phoenix Blood! That's a blood feud in our clan!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
