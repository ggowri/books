  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne sneered, &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t bid either. I&rsquo;m an ordinary person, but you are the heir of the Ashford family. Your family owns assets of billions of dollars. What are you afraid of?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley laughed and said smugly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just waiting for you to bid. No matter what you want to buy, I will outbid you with a higher price. I&rsquo;m sure you won&rsquo;t buy anything at this auction.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Really? I&rsquo;m afraid you can&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; Osborne sneered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He suddenly raised the bidding paddle in his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He bid loudly. &ldquo;100 thousand dollars!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This lot was a children&rsquo;s painting. The style of it was very childish. In the painting, a teenager in his teens and a girl of four or five years old were fighting against ferocious wolves in a shabby street.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The lines of the painting were childish, the picture was exaggerated, and the colors were poorly used. All the bidders could tell that the picture was a child&rsquo;s fantasy at first glance, and the painting had little value.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The big shots of Mayby City thought Clarissa could not have provided this painting. After all, Clarissa had held an art exhibition before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Therefore, the bid for this painting was not fierce. After several rounds of bidding, the price was still around 50 thousand dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Osborne suddenly raised the price to 100 thousand dollars, which immediately attracted some people&rsquo;s attention. When they saw the bidder was Osborne, they shook their heads.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;That loser. His identity has been exposed before, and he lost face. Now, he probably wants to spend a little money to save his face.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Someone laughed. &ldquo;100 thousand dollars? That&rsquo;s probably all his money!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;He just tries to satisfy his vanity!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Many people whispered in low voices with a look of disdain on their faces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne ignored their whispers and stared at the painting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Some distant memories came into his mind at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Osborne and Anastasia were homeless, they were still children. He was ten years old, and Anastasia was five years old. They walked in a dilapidated and gloomy alley in hunger. Suddenly, they saw a group of stray dogs surrounding a pretty little girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The girl was so frightened that she cried loudly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne rushed forward without hesitation and drove away the group of stray dogs. He did not do this to save that girl but to snatch food from these dogs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He and Anastasia were starving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After driving away the stray dogs, Osborne got some dirty bread. Seeing the little girl crying, he thought she was hungry, so he reluctantly gave her a piece of bread.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After that, he took Anastasia away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Things like this happened frequently during the days when he and Anastasia were wandering. Osborne had forgotten about it long ago, but when he saw this childish painting, he remembered it again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He suddenly thought the boy who was fighting with the wolves in the painting was very similar to him, who once fought for food with stray dogs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The little girl in the painting looked like Anastasia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A strong impulse arose in Osborne&rsquo;s heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He wanted to buy this picture.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the future, he would hang this painting on the wall to remind himself not to forget the sufferings he once had. Even if he became the heir of the Godfather one day, he would not forget the life of fighting for food with stray dogs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That was why Osborne raised the bidding paddle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It wasn&rsquo;t because of Wesley&rsquo;s provocation but because he really wanted the painting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Wesley didn&rsquo;t know this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He looked at Osborne with disdain and said indifferently, &ldquo;Loser, you dared raise the bidding paddle. I told you I won&rsquo;t let you get anything at this auction.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After saying that, Wesley raised his bidding paddle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He said, &ldquo;Two hundred thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley looked at Osborne with disdain, but soon, he saw Osborne raising his bidding paddle expressionlessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Three hundred thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hearing Osborne&rsquo;s bid, Wesley frowned but didn&rsquo;t overthink it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He didn&rsquo;t know that Osborne had gotten 20 million dollars from the Caldwell family, let alone that Osborne had received reward money from the Godfather. Wesley thought that Osborne had some savings in the three years of marriage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He guessed that Osborne might have at least several hundred thousand dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley snorted coldly and raised his bidding paddle again. &ldquo;Four hundred thousand dollars! Bastard, let me see how much money you have. You dare to compete with me in terms of wealth. Humph, you&rsquo;re courting death.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Looking at the arrogant Wesley, Osborne said nothing and continued to raise his bidding paddle. &ldquo;Five hundred thousand dollars!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley got a little angry and raised the bidding paddle without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;One million dollars!&rdquo; he sneered. &ldquo;Osborne, one million dollars is all your wealth to you, but to me, it&rsquo;s no different than a hundred dollars. What can you use to compete with me?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne glanced at Wesley indifferently and chuckled, &ldquo;Really? Then let&rsquo;s continue. Two million dollars.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone on the scene was stunned. Two million dollars was already the highest bid of this charity auction. No one expected Osborne to make such a high bid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">To them, two million dollars might not be a big sum of money, but they had to think twice before spending two million dollars to buy such a worthless charity lot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Osborne did what they hesitated to do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even Wesley was stunned. He looked at Osborne in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne said disdainfully, &ldquo;Mr. Ashford, don&rsquo;t you dare to bid for it anymore? Who just said that I can&rsquo;t win anything at this auction?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Are you admitting defeat now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Are you a coward?&rdquo;</p><div class="pagination">
