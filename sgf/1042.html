  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo stared in astonishment at Osborne in the culture tank, his eyes gleaming with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had long known that Osborne had remarkable physical strength; otherwise, he wouldn't have refused to kill him after capturing him twice. That&rsquo;s also the reason why he used the most precious culture medium on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo aimed to mold Osborne into the most formidable Human Slave and an invaluable weapon under his control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he never expected Osborne's physical strength to be a nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had assumed it would only be around two or three at best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frowning, Gerardo said, "Could there be an issue with the testing equipment? He's Class AAA, yet his physical strength is nine, his energy utilization rate is 99.9%, and he gains one point in improvement every hour?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is simply beyond what a human should possess!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The technician, equally shocked, shared Gerardo's disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll redo the tests with a different set of equipment!" he declared, quickly getting to work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, new test results emerged, and they were identical to the first&mdash;no discrepancies at all. The equipment was working perfectly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's face was a mask of astonishment as he continued to gaze at Osborne in the culture tank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exclaimed, "Is he even human?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I underestimated him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo appeared extremely excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a top-tier Class S warrior, Gerardo understood that when a person broke through </span><span>Class S, his body underwent a transformation, becoming extraordinarily powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that stage, even metahumans would become powerful, while pure martial artists would find themselves at a disadvantage because their physical intensity wouldn&rsquo;t win them an edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Research labs around the world had examined countless Class S samples. It was concluded that the average physical strength of newly promoted Class S warriors was around one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The physical strength of an ordinary Class S warrior was around one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If someone could exceed that threshold in physical strength after breaking into Class S, they were dubbed a super genius.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, those who made it to Class S were already top-tier geniuses. Among that elite group, those who ranked at the top were considered super geniuses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rarely would one find a warrior with physical strength over two, and those who did were exceptionally powerful and rarely seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo himself had only achieved a physical strength of 1.8 when he ascended to Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne&rsquo;s already reached nine while still classified as Class AAA!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was no wonder Gerardo found it hard to believe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord, who had dominated the Godson Rankings for over a decade, was undoubtedly one of the most gifted individuals of his time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, his initial physical strength before he entered the culture tank had been a mere 0.6.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only one-fifteenth of Osborne's!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Typically, the physical strength of an average Class AAA genius hovered around 0.1. Lord's achievement of 0.6 was already six times that standard, marking him as impressively powerful and leaving Gerardo astounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given Lord's trajectory, after breaking through to Class S, he could potentially exceed a physical strength of two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo had even hesitated on whether to let Lord use the best culture medium.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he felt relieved he hadn't, as Osborne clearly outclassed Lord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's physical strength of nine was nearly on par with that of a veteran Class S warrior, who typically boasted a strength of around 10.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The physical strength benchmark for top Class S warriors was about 100.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's physical strength was already infinitely close to that of a veteran Class S warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, Osborne's energy utilization rate stood at an incredible 99.9%!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant he was absorbing nearly all the energy from the culture medium without wasting any.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In stark contrast, Lord had achieved only 60%, which Gerardo had considered the highest value he'd ever encountered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his eyes sparkling, Gerardo chuckled, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A super Human Slave is about to be born! An improvement rate of one point every hour? That means his physical strength will increase by one per hour! And according to his enslavement speed, he can last four days in the culture tank!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Four days later, his physical strength will exceed 100! He'll be beyond the average strength of </span><span>top Class</span><span> S warriors&mdash;almost equal to me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, before I merged with the corpse of the god, my physical strength was only 180! It was only after that fusion that I reached 500!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They say a physical strength over 1000 is the threshold for becoming a god!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And he's only a Class AAA!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When he breaks into Class S, what will his physical strength be? Most people see at least a threefold increase upon breaking into Class S, sometimes even tenfold! Given his already high level, a tripling is quite ideal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That is to say, after he breaks through to Class S, his physical strength could easily exceed 300&mdash;or even more!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's magnificent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo was completely exhilarated.</span></p><div class="pagination">
