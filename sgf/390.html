  <div class="container"><p style="text-align:left;">Thanks to the Breath of Celestial, Osborne could effortlessly control the surging power. After he restrained it, no one would discover that he had become a Class A martial master.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He first came to Isaac.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The Maritime Auction was crucial to the Augustine family. Even Isaac, who had long ceased to be involved in the family affairs, paid close attention to it all the time.</p><p style="text-align:left;">When the auction started, he would even rush over to ensure its safe conduct.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It seemed that Osborne was not the only one worried about the auction.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After he shared his speculation, Isaac remained composed and sighed, &quot;Osborne, regarding your guess, I&#x27;ve considered it for quite some time. I didn&#x27;t bring it up earlier because I was afraid it would cause you undue worry.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Now that you&#x27;re aware of this, let&#x27;s discuss openly and strategize how to make the Maritime Auction go smoothly.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Isaac was serious.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;The Augustine family is desperate for the success of the Maritime Auction! Do you know how many big shots have contacted us for boat tickets during this period?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Do you know how much we have earned from just selling boat tickets?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;The Augustine family&#x27;s fleet of 18 cruise ships can accommodate a total of 80 thousand guests, all of which are currently fully booked. Under normal circumstances, the average ticket price is about 120 thousand dollars. However, due to high demand, we are selling tickets at five times that price.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;So, the revenues reach 50 billion dollars.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;That&#x27;s 50 billion dollars!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Considering all their expenses aboard the cruise ship, despite the Maritime Auction lasting just seven days, our net profit is expected to exceed 50 billion dollars!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;With these funds, we will be able to get through this difficult time! So, even though I knew your plan would be very risky, I still didn&#x27;t stop you.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne couldn&#x27;t help but open his mouth in astonishment.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The revenues from boat tickets amounted to 50 billion dollars!</p><p style="text-align:left;">It appeared that the Holy Crown and the Mighty Scepter, designed by Alison, captivated the wealthy. Comparable to those of the queen of Yalynch, the crown and scepter featured a diamond as large as a baby&#x27;s fist, irresistible to any woman.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Even without the financial means to bid on the Holy Crown and the Mighty Scepter, many still desired to purchase a boat ticket to witness the spectacle.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Moreover, Alison also prepared a large number of jewelry of different levels, including smaller diamonds, emeralds, amethysts, and so on.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In addition, the Draco Group would contribute a selection of auction items to enhance the event.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Therefore, the Maritime Auction attracted a large number of rich people from all over the world.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Eighty thousand tickets were simply not enough.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Even the Chevalier family dispatched four cruise ships. The tickets were sold out in an instant, allowing them to make a fortune.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Isaac was preoccupied.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Considering the current situation of the Augustine family, it&#x27;s inconceivable for them to relinquish this business opportunity worth 50 billion dollars in profit. Yet, the risks are significant! To achieve that 50 billion dollars, we must ensure flawless execution throughout this auction.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;At the very least, nothing serious should occur.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Otherwise, if something happens to the 80 thousand wealthy people from all over the world on the ships, the compensation and various pressures alone will be enough to overwhelm the Augustine family.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;So the Maritime Auction will decide the fate of our family! If it succeeds, we will solve our difficulties and get back on track. The cruise business will expand and become a gold mine comparable to a money printing machine.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;If not, we will have no choice but to flee with our clansmen overnight.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Speaking of this, Isaac couldn&#x27;t help laughing.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne knew that Isaac tried to comfort him and wished to shield him from pressure.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But how could Osborne not feel pressured?</p><p style="text-align:left;">He didn&#x27;t expect that the Maritime Auction he had proposed would actually be related to the fate of the Augustine family.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The survival of the Augustine family, which had persisted for centuries, and the prospects for its three hundred direct descendants and five thousand collateral descendants to lead a privileged life hinged entirely on the outcome of the Maritime Auction.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne suddenly felt the responsibility on his shoulders become enormous.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;The Augustine family&#x27;s Maritime Auction must not fail!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">He contemplated, &quot;This concerns the fate of the Augustine family and my succession test. I must revive the Augustine family to its former glory and elevate it among the top three ancient families in Dampston.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Therefore, the Maritime Auction must not fail.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne said solemnly, &quot;Isaac, I didn&#x27;t think it through before. Fortunately, there is still a chance. It will definitely be successful!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I&#x27;m boarding now. I&#x27;ll keep an eye on the Maritime Auction. Anyone who tries to cause trouble, I&#x27;ll deal with them! Even if the Aberrants try to sabotage the auction, I will make them regret it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Take it easy. After all...</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;The Draco Group backs us!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne said goodbye to Isaac. Instead of heading directly to the ship, he came to Isa&#x27;s mansion.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He hadn&#x27;t planned to alarm her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He was now a Class A martial master, and his current strength was enough to solve most problems.</p><p style="text-align:left;">However, the Maritime Auction was incredibly important.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne had no choice but to shamelessly ask Isa for help again.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I hope she won&#x27;t reject me.&quot;</p><div class="pagination">
