  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's face remained icy, like an eternal glacier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Listening to Apollo's arrogant and confident words, she felt nothing but disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She replied coldly, "Brag after you've actually accomplished it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bragging?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo's lips curled up in a smug smile, unfazed by Clarissa's attitude. "Anyone familiar with me knows I never brag! If I dare to say it, I can do it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Fox, what do you think?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Chevalier family has considerable influence in Skyefall. Whether it's legitimate or underworld matters, we call the shots. If Skyefall Security were still a subsidiary of the Draco Group, we might have shown you some respect. But now...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone who dares refuse me will find it impossible to operate in Skyefall!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will shut them down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I trust the new owner and general manager of Skyefall Security won't be foolish enough to make that mistake, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo's expression turned icy cold as he glared at Judith, his eyes full of menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flash of anger crossed Judith's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo was threatening Skyefall Security. As its vice president, how could she not be furious?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, she didn't dare to show her anger. Instead, she put on an even more fawning smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Chevalier, you exaggerate. How could we refuse you or miss a chance to cooperate with the Chevalier family? I'm sure our collaboration will go smoothly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, sitting in a corner, felt his anger rising as he watched this scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "What is this vice president, Judith, up to?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If all the managers at Skyefall Security are like her, lacking backbone, I'll have to consider overhauling the management team."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo was very pleased with Judith's behavior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his eyes, without the Draco Group's backing, Skyefall Security was just an ordinary security company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo didn't take them seriously at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Skyefall, it would be too easy for the Chevalier family to crush a security company. A single word from him could cause severe losses for Skyefall Security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why he was so confident, so certain that Skyefall Security wouldn't dare refuse him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got some sense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo told Judith, "To be the vice president of Skyefall Security, you must have some skill. If you ever think about it, you can come and join the Chevalier family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judith was overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Chevalier. If there's an opportunity, I'd love to work on something big with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression grew even more ingratiating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a cold laugh, having already decided to fire Judith. He thought, "How did someone like her become the vice president of Skyefall Security?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What is the general manager, Valentin Gibson, doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the office door opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A middle-aged man in his forties stepped in. He had a strong presence, was tall and sturdy, and had an authoritative demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Gibson, you finally arrived. Mr. Chevalier has been waiting," Judith quickly said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Chevalier, let me introduce you to our general manager, Valentin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin nodded at Apollo, his expression neutral.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly scanned the office environment, barely acknowledging the others until his gaze fell upon Osborne, causing him to pause briefly as if about to say something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne reacted quickly, shaking his head slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin was the only one who knew Osborne was the new owner of Skyefall Security. They had spoken on the phone before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they hadn't met, Valentin certainly had his photo and could recognize him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin subtly nodded at Osborne before turning to Apollo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Chevalier, nice to meet you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo smiled faintly, "So, you're the general manager, Valentin? I hear only you can decide on leasing the Class A defense system. I've come here to lease that system.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A flat rate of 100 million dollars a year!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you agree, Skyefall Security will gain the Chevalier family's friendship."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo finished speaking, and everyone looked shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna frowned at Apollo, wanting to speak but ultimately staying silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One hundred million dollars was too low!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Class A defense system included many high-tech defense weapons, all products of the Draco Group, many of which were not for sale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cost of the system was exorbitant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even leasing it would typically start at 500 million dollars a year, with some willing to pay a billion dollars unable to secure it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, Apollo was offering only 100 million dollars!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin's expression turned cold as he glared at Apollo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One hundred million dollars?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Chevalier, are you joking? Or did you misspeak?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo smiled faintly, "No, I'm not joking, nor did I misspeak. I said 100 million dollars. A yearly rent of 100 million dollars is a lot, and it comes with the Chevalier family's friendship. That's a huge gain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin replied coldly, "What if I refuse?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo's expression turned even colder, his tone threatening. "Then you should consider carefully. If you refuse, what Skyefall Security will receive from the Chevalier family will be, hostility."</span></p><div class="pagination">
