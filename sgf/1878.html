  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're being reckless!" Zachary said anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as he reminded himself that the figure before him was merely Osborne's Spatial Clone, he felt helpless. There was no point in lecturing a clone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reality that Osborne had defeated both him and Virgil using just a clone only deepened his despondency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their combined strength was no match for Osborne's Spatial Clone. Osborne's power was truly astounding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be careful. If things go south, you need to retreat immediately. As long as you make it back to the Hudson family, you'll be safe. Even though Trevor is a Supernal Deity King, the Hudson family isn't afraid of him," Zachary advised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understand," Osborne replied, falling into silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary and Virgil exchanged glances, both reflecting a sense of resignation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, he is my nephew. The stronger he gets, the happier I should be! You should learn from him and seek his guidance," Zachary encouraged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Virgil offered a bitter smile. "I get it, Dad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's actually the leader of the Seven Young Deity Kings of the Human Community. I was curious about where these seven super-geniuses came from! I never imagined one of them would be my nephew. If I told others, they'd be so envious!" Zachary chuckled with pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, as thoughts of Osborne's dealings with Trevor crossed his mind, he was worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how talented Osborne was, he was only a mid-level Deity King, while Trevor was a Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary instructed, "I can't just sit back and do nothing. Virgil, notify the Hudson Guards immediately. Get them all ready. If Osborne is in danger, every Hudson Guard needs to mobilize right away. We can't let anything happen to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if it means going to war with the Baxter family, we must protect Osborne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood, Dad," Virgil replied before rushing off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne's real body was hidden in the jungle not far from Astral Wolf Peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of his Spatial Clones stood atop Astral Wolf Peak, gripping Kurt's neck while surveying the scene ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the distance, a massive ice crystal castle was soaring towards them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atop the castle sat a stern-looking middle-aged man on a throne, with a dozen young men and women sprawled before him, trembling in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man was Trevor, Kurt's father, the Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched in awe. The colossal ice crystal castle was built with power, a testament to Trevor's incredible power-controlling abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne narrowed his eyes, recognizing that such a feat was beyond his own capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This ice crystal castle was utterly exquisite, resembling a masterpiece, but to view it merely as a work of art would be a grave misunderstanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not only stunning in its beauty but also possessed formidable defensive strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every inch of the ice was infused with the terrifying energy of the ice element. Even a group of highest-level Deity Kings would struggle to breach its defenses; even if they managed to chip away at the edges, it would be an impressive feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time Osborne had witnessed a Supernal Deity King's power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While it wasn't a true move, it was an undeniable display of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could feel the weight of Trevor's strength&mdash;something far beyond his current abilities. Even with all his tricks, he knew he couldn't stand against Trevor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Osborne steadied himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought of Zachary's warning. When dealing with a Supernal Deity King, even with spatial power, extreme caution was essential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne's Spatial Clone on Astral Wolf Peak shouted down at Trevor, "Stop!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trevor, if you come any closer, I'll snap your son's neck! You're a Supernal Deity King; if you approach, I might get scared! When I get scared, my hands might tremble. If your son dies, don't blame me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the magnificent ice castle halted mid-air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor, seated on his throne, cast a cold glare at Osborne and Kurt, who was struggling to free himself from Osborne's grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt had regained consciousness, but much of his divine power was still sealed by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his father, he cried out in desperation, "Dad! Help me! I don't want to die! Save me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor's expression darkened ominously at his son's pleas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed Osborne with a chilling stare, the murderous intent in his eyes palpable. The onlookers felt a bone-chilling aura radiating from Trevor, causing them to instinctively retreat from the ice castle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Trevor spoke, "Theodore, correct? Let Kurt go. I have what you want, and I can hand it over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly. "You're quite direct! In that case, let them bring it to me! Once I confirm its authenticity, I'll release him!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
