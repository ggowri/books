  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Wait, I&rsquo;m letting her go!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just as Ophelia finished her countdown, about to order the shooting, Osborne took a deep breath and released Evelyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His eyes, filled with madness, locked onto Ophelia. &ldquo;Tell your people to leave the hospital right now. If Anastasia gets so much as a scratch, you&rsquo;ll all pay with your lives.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia sneered in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing that Evelyn was free, she said coldly, &ldquo;You think you can bargain with me? Your life is in my hands.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With a wave of her hand, she ordered, &ldquo;Get him. If he resists, shoot him.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her dozen or so bodyguards moved swiftly upon her command.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grins of contempt adorned their faces as they stormed up the stairs, closing in on Osborne in no time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But then, unexpectedly, Osborne chuckled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia taunted, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s so funny? You&rsquo;re about to die.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m laughing because you&rsquo;re celebrating too soon,&rdquo; Osborne said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Under everyone&rsquo;s gaze, he suddenly tore open his coat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ophelia, take a good look at this. Go ahead, order them to shoot.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At his fierce shout, Ophelia scoffed, &ldquo;I told you, no matter what tricks you have left, today you&rsquo;re&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her words faltered as she stared in shock and fear at Osborne&rsquo;s body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone from the Caldwell family now wore expressions of horror, backing away with terror, as if Osborne had turned into a monster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Panic spread among them all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s body was covered in rows of homemade explosives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was a walking bomb!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And in his right hand, he held a remote control, his finger hovering over a menacing red button.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia gasped, her body going cold with shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne saw her fear and smirked knowingly. &ldquo;The explosives strapped to me could turn my body into shreds or bring down this entire villa to rubble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;None of you will survive. I might be just a poor man, but having you noble members join me in death seems fitting.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s words sent a chill through everyone present.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia shrieked in disbelief, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re insane! Where did you get all these explosives?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In Rosmandi, guns were everywhere, easily bought with money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But high-grade explosives were tightly controlled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even for a wealthy family like the Caldwells, obtaining them was nearly impossible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">So, Ophelia never expected Osborne to show up at the manor rigged with explosives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne spoke coldly, his resolve unwavering, &ldquo;Ophelia, I&rsquo;ve made myself clear. I didn&rsquo;t come here today expecting to leave alive. If I can&rsquo;t get my fair share in the divorce settlement, then we&rsquo;ll all go down together.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, he suddenly moved forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He approached one of the guards, who held a gun but dared not use it. As Osborne approached, sweat formed on the guard&rsquo;s face, his hands trembling on the weapon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne chuckled darkly, disarming the guard without resistance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The man feared any sudden move could set off the explosives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If they detonated at this range, there would be nothing left of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Helplessly, he watched as Osborne seized the gun and brutally struck him on the forehead with the butt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The guard&rsquo;s head split open, blood streaming as he cried out and collapsed to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne looked down at him, his voice cutting. &ldquo;Just hours ago, at the Caldwell Tower, it was you who smashed my head with that gun butt, wasn&rsquo;t it? Now, how does it feel to have your head cracked open the same way? Enjoying it?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s declaration hung in the tense air as he delivered a fierce kick to the guard&rsquo;s face, shattering his nose and rendering him unconscious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He turned to the surrounding guards, all of whom had once laid hands on him, beaten his body, and trampled his dignity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Fear now filled their eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Without hesitation, Osborne swung the gun&rsquo;s butt again, knocking down another guard, unleashing a flurry of punches and kicks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon, all the guards who had assaulted him earlier were sprawled on the ground, bloodied and broken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia could only watch in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She stared at Osborne, now transformed into a relentless force, a stark contrast to the timid man she thought she knew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Today, he was fearless, powerful, and unstoppable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Ophelia finally managed to shout over the chaos. &ldquo;Osborne, I know you. You won&rsquo;t go down with us. You&rsquo;ve had your revenge. That&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne wiped the bloody gun with a grim determination. &ldquo;My dear ex-wife, are you really sure you know me?&rdquo;</p><div class="pagination">
