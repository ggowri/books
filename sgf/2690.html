  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Adriana, send someone to Ice Crystal Hall! I built a Level Three Cosmic Translocator there when I had nothing to do before. I originally planned it as a backup, but I didn't expect it to actually come in handy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne told Adriana through Telepathy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana widened her eyes upon hearing this, looking at Osborne in confusion, as if she hadn't clearly heard what he was saying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, she had naturally heard it clearly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She just couldn't understand why Osborne had built a Level Three Cosmic Translocator in Ice Crystal Hall when he had nothing to do.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A Level Three Cosmic Translocator isn't something one person can build. She didn't believe Osborne could construct a Level Three Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the entire Glorious Divine Kingdom, only members of the Royal Family can construct a Level Three Cosmic Translocator. Any faction wishing to build a Level Three Cosmic Translocator must apply to the Royal Family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Adriana with a puzzled expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I didn't catch what you just said. Say it again."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana quickly said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could only say it again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, Adriana was even more shocked. "Are you serious? You can build a Level Three Cosmic Translocator? How is that possible? On your own? When did you learn that?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "Is it that hard? I don't think so! Last time I went to Stellar Region M72, you sent me all the information from Fairy Moon Sect about building a Cosmic Translocator. I took some time to study it, so I naturally mastered it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Building a Level Three Cosmic Translocator is a piece of cake. Now I should even be able to build a Level Four Cosmic Translocator."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne finished speaking, and Adriana was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you even human?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "Whether I'm human or not, you can study that carefully later. You can research me however you want in bed. But for now, quickly get everyone to leave here and head to the secret base."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Once the Protective Barrier is broken, it will be too late!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana blushed shyly upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She glared fiercely at Osborne. Fortunately, Osborne conveyed these words to her through Telepathy, so the others around couldn't hear. Otherwise, she would feel ashamed, and her image as the leader of the Fairy Moon Sect would collapse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she also knew that this was not the time to discuss such things.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She quickly announced, "Everyone, listen up. Enter the Ice Crystal Hall immediately! May, you go too! Only you know the spatial coordinates of the secret base. There's a translocator there. Adjust the coordinates and get everyone out as soon as possible."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as she finished speaking, everyone sprang into action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>May replied, "Ms. Alba, be careful. I'll be right back!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, May also left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without her assistance as the Supreme Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, the Protective Barrier became even harder to hold. Cracks appeared rapidly. Osborne, Adriana, and the others had to unleash even greater power to barely hold it off.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this was only temporary.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne turned his head toward another direction. Isa, Clarissa, and the others were there at the moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned and said, "Isa, Clarissa, you leave too! Go to Ice Crystal Hall and use the translocator to escape! Wait for us at the secret base!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa frowned upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No! We're not leaving! You're still here, we can't abandon you and leave alone!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head. "Your cultivation level isn't high enough, so staying won't help! You'll only get in my way. So, be good and wait for me at the secret base!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isa and the others bit their lips.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, they nodded. "Alright! Make sure nothing happens to you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, they glanced at Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Adriana, you be careful too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, they all left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Adriana in surprise because Isa's way of addressing Adriana had changed!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly asked through Telepathy, "Adriana, have you already confessed to them? She's not calling you Ms. Alba anymore but directly by your name!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana blushed instantly upon hearing this, then nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, I confessed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How did you confess?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana shrugged and explained, "I just told them I couldn't control my feelings and made love with you! From now on, I'm no longer their teacher. I'm their friend! And I will respect them! If they don't accept me, I'll just take you away. Whether they accept it or not, they have to."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hey! At a time like this, you still have the mood to ask that? Hurry up and think of something! If the Protective Barrier breaks, we're doomed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he also knew this wasn't the time to say such things. He looked at the nearly shattered Protective Barrier, frowning as he thought of a solution.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Outside, there are nearly fifty Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once the Protective Barrier breaks, these people will swarm in. With their strength, it's absolutely impossible to hold them off.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What should we do?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luckily, Osborne felt the Level Three Cosmic Translocator he set up had been activated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone with a cultivation level below Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection has already been sent to the secret stronghold.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, even if the Protective Barrier breaks, Osborne is confident he can escape.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he doesn't want to run away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at Frederick, Callista, Weston, Quinn, and others outside the Protective Barrier, with hatred and killing intent flashing deep in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps it's time for him to openly seek revenge!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Frederick finally noticed something was wrong. He coldly stared at Adriana. "Ms. Alba, you're so cunning! You actually secretly built a Level Three Cosmic Translocator within the Fairy Moon Sect!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who did you hire to build it? Evernight Court or Phantom Commerce Guild?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick's face looked grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana raised an eyebrow. She knew Frederick had misunderstood, thinking the Level Three Cosmic Translocator in Fairy Moon Sect was secretly built by someone from Evernight Court or Phantom Commerce Guild at her request.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, across the entire Racial Convergence Planet, only these three forces could construct a Level Three Cosmic Translocator.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana naturally wouldn&rsquo;t tell Frederick the truth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fact that Osborne could independently build a Level Three Cosmic Translocator couldn&rsquo;t be easily revealed. Otherwise, they&rsquo;d be in big trouble.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, she smiled and said, "Take a guess?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick's expression turned cold. "Boring. It's either Evernight Court or Phantom Commerce Guild! I didn't expect Fairy Moon Sect to have colluded with them long ago. It seems wiping out Fairy Moon Sect was the right decision."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana sneered, "Think whatever you want! It's impossible for you to destroy Fairy Moon Sect! I won't let you succeed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick sneered, "But you can't stop me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Keep attacking! Fairy Moon Sect's Protective Barrier is about to break!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Protective Barrier let out a strained crashing sound, and Adriana's expression grew even graver.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne spoke.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Adriana, you previously asked me what grudge I have against the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom! I didn't answer you at the time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And now, you're about to find out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, with Adriana's surprised expression, Osborne faced Frederick, along with Callista, Weston, Quinn, and the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He smiled and loudly announced, "Ladies and gentlemen, your friend is back!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After he finished speaking, everyone was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick sneered, "Friend? Kid, what nonsense are you spouting? But no matter what you're saying, today you are all doomed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile, "Oh, really?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We don't even know who the loser is! But you should first see who I really am."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne's face quickly began to change.</span></p><div class="pagination">
