  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce glare at Osborne, Divine Shadow snapped, "Why would you even think of greeting him on my behalf? I have no idea what you're talking about! I have no intention of seeing him now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Divine Shadow transformed into a cat and swiftly vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched the spot where Divine Shadow disappeared, his face beaming with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "Grandma Divine Shadow is blushing! She's feeling shy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to the God of Star, Osborne sincerely said, "God of Star, thank you for coming to our aid. Without your intervention, the Augustine family, could have suffered significant losses. My grandfather Sebastian and my sister Anastasia could have been in grave danger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't need to thank me. It's the least I can do. If not for you and Ms. Night, I would still be just a fragment of a soul, unable to regain my Divine Body. Speaking of which, where is Ms. Night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne understood the God of Star's reference to Ms. Night as Isa. Thinking of Isa, Osborne couldn't help but feel a bit dazed. She had left almost four months ago, with no word since.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only had she disappeared herself, but she had also taken Clarissa, Emma, and Austin with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a pang of helplessness as he pondered her whereabouts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know where she went. All I know is that she's on a crucial mission, something I'm not yet qualified to be involved in," Osborne explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star was taken aback by this revelation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're capable of killing Transcendent Deities now. Even against me, you would likely come out on top. However, whatever Ms. Night is doing must be monumental&mdash;something beyond even my comprehension."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's thought, the God of Star continued, "In the past, I was but a wild god, unattached to any family or faction. Wherever I went, that was my home. Now, I yearn for a place to settle down. I wonder if the Augustine family would welcome an outsider like me into your fold."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was overjoyed by the suggestion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He enthusiastically replied, "God of Star, we would be honored to have you join us! I promise, if you choose to become a part of the Augustine family, we will treat you as one of our own, as a respected elder."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star nodded, smiling, "Then, I look forward to the hospitality."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was elated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star was a Transcendent Deity, and having such a warrior join the Augustine family would significantly bolster their strength. Besides, the God of Star had saved the Augustine family three times now. The family would undoubtedly be thrilled with her decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With you on our side, I feel more confident in our ability to take down the Deschanel Clan," Osborne declared, his eyes flashing with a cold resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deschanel Clan had sent three Transcendent Deities and seventeen Superior Deities against the Augustine family. Without the timely intervention of the God of Star and Divine Shadow and without Osborne's swift emergence from seclusion, the Augustine family would have been doomed that day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This grudge could not go unavenged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deschanel Clan's ambitions were too vast, their strength overwhelming. They were too close to the Augustine family, and the enmity between them could not be resolved. Only one could continue to exist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, instead of passively waiting for the Deschanel Clan to strike again, it was better to take the initiative and strike back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow had mentioned that the world's rules were incomplete. Even the Deschanel Clan's Deity Overlord, Terrence, could only restore his power to the peak of Transcendent Deity in this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a sardonic chuckle, his mind reeling with thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Transcendent Deity peak? I'm not intimidated by that anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why should the Augustine family always be the punching bag for other superpowers and dominant factions?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why should we always play defense?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why do entities like League of Divine Descent, </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, and especially the Deschanel Clan think they can just waltz in and attack us, while we can't even consider counter-offensive moves?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, it was because our strength wasn't up to par.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, our might is sufficient to rival any superpower, even those in the overlord class. Why shouldn't we go on the offensive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His resolve was set; this time, Osborne was primed to attack the Deschanel Clan head-on, ready to erase them from existence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Star eyed him with astonishment. "You're going after the Deschanel Clan? You're ready for an all-out war with them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne </span><span>nodded,</span><span> his face unyielding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm done with always being attacked, always on the defensive! Not only will I engage the Deschanel Clan in an all-out war and wipe them out, but I also plan to take down League of Divine Descent and </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization entirely! After this, the Augustine family won't need to skulk around anymore. I aim to make it so that no </span><span>other faction on Blue Planet dares to cross us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Star was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think you can pull it off? Forget about the others, the Deschanel Clan has already sent out three Transcendent Deity warriors. Who knows how many more Transcendent Deities they have? Maybe dozens more?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scoffed, "Even if they have dozens, I will annihilate the Deschanel Clan! Mark my words, within three days, I will lead the Augustine family in declaring war against the Deschanel Clan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne's unwavering determination, God of Star refrained from any further dissuasion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly thereafter, Osborne returned to the Augustine Bastion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He convened the high-ranking members of the Augustine family and announced his plan for a retaliatory strike against the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><div class="pagination">
