  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greyson was drenched in cold sweat, struggling to fend off several Class AAA assassins from the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His sole focus was on stopping them from reaching any of the Lambert family members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would have guessed a Class S assassin could slip in so close, within 30 feet?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne hadn't warned him, he would never have noticed the Class S assassin's impending strike amid the chaos. In an instant, his throat could have been sliced open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a powerhouse like a Class S would have no chance of survival from such an attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gratefulness flooded through him as he glanced over at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Osborne's alertness that had saved his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had been killed, the remaining Lambert family members would have stood no chance against the onslaught of assassins. They would certainly face extinction here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But by the time Greyson dodged the assassination attempt, Osborne had shifted his attention elsewhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His focus now lay on Roy, who was positioned farther away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne concentrated his mental strength, extending it toward Roy's direction. The approach of the Class S assassin went undetected by conventional means; their advanced Stealth Art left no spatial distortions, rendering even Satan's Eye useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Osborne's mental strength allowed him to sense their presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, a foreboding shroud of mental strength encompassed the area surrounding Roy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the very next moment, Osborne's expression shifted from concentration to alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir Lambert, watch out! Behind you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, even as the warning left his lips, it was already too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he spoke, Roy felt a sharp pain as blood erupted from his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A divine artifact dagger had pierced through his back, protruding out the other side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood was sprayed everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roy's body stiffened in shock as he looked down to see the dagger embedded in his chest, feeling the cold grip of death tightening around his heart as it was brutally pierced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From behind him, a Class S </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> assassin emerged with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not content with the initial strike, he twisted the dagger viciously, shattering Roy's heart into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His smirk directed at Osborne seemed to mockingly say, "Your warning came too late. I've already taken him out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that heart-stopping moment, the entire Lambert family froze in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir Lambert!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cacophony of anguished cries erupted around them, each family member stunned at the sight of Roy, his heart impaled, his life force flickering away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greyson stood rooted to the spot, unable to comprehend the horror unfolding before his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roy had been assassinated by a Class S operative from the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fury and desperation flooded Greyson's heart as tears welled in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was ready to go charging in to save Roy, but Osborne moved faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the Class S assassin successfully stab Roy's heart, Osborne wasted no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce determination, he unleashed his Light Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Light erupted from him, enveloping a half-mile radius, wrapping Greyson, Roy, and every Lambert family member in its protective glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, it ensnared over fifty Class AAA assassins and three Class S assassins in its radiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One Class S assassin was dangerously close, lurking within 66 feet of Osborne, poised to strike him as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, as Osborne activated the Light Realm, the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization's ambush crumbled before him. He quickly began to fall back, signaling all the assassins to focus their attacks on his newly formed Light Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne paid them no mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Light Realm had reached Level Four. Even three Class S </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization killers would struggle to break through it quickly&mdash;unless they also unleashed their Realms and caused them to self-destruct.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, saving Roy was his top priority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had only two Class S powerhouses on their side. If Roy perished, their overall combat strength would be significantly diminished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, he appeared beside the fallen Roy, who was slowly descending into unconsciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Life was rapidly draining from Roy's eyes as his heart lay violently shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To everyone else, he looked finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But not to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Light of Redemption!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a divine light cascaded from above, encasing Roy's body. The potent healing power surged through him, knitting together his wounds and miraculously restoring even his broken heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roy stirred back to life, his body regained its vitality, and any energy or mental strength he had lost was completely replenished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock washed over his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could utter a word, Osborne cut in with urgency. "Sir Lambert, watch out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned his attention to the group of </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization killers, who were relentlessly pounding against his Light Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shimmering barrier was trembling under the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scoffed, fury igniting in his eyes. "You're all going to die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Destruction Orbs!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Disintegration Rays!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne unleashed his full might, focusing first on the Class AAA assassins rather than the Class S ones. He had to clear the battlefield of the fifty or so Class AAA threats before tackling anything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blinding bursts of light and searing rays targeted each </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization assassin, creating a storm of deadly energy raining down upon them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, anguished screams pierced the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Class AAA killers were powerless against such overwhelming force, and one by one, they fell.</span></p><div class="pagination">
