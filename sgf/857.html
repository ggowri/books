  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?! Are you saying Axell is just a disguise for Osborne?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Axell is Osborne?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aleena's revelation left Rhett, Stuart, and Vivian completely stunned.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nodding, Aleena continued, "You all know about the feud between the Augustine family and the Aberrants.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If Osborne were to show up in Tethynia for Cuthbert's Honor Quest Ceremony under his real identity, he'd be a prime target for the Aberrants, and they wouldn't hesitate to assassinate him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, Mr. Caleb Augustine approached me, asking if I could arrange a new identity for Osborne. Given the good relationship between our Lambert family and the Augustine family, I agreed to let Osborne pose as Axell and brought him to Tethynia.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't want to share this, but seeing you all mock Osborne, I felt embarrassed for you and had to come clean."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she spoke, it hit Stuart like a ton of bricks. His face flushed with shame.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Memories of Tethynia flooded back to him. He recalled how he had been defeated and humiliated by Roger, the assassin from the Eityreia Organization, only to be saved by Osborne, who avenged him by taking down Roger.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then there was the time Rhett had challenged Andrew and faced brutal humiliation&mdash;again, it was Osborne who stepped in to turn the tables, making Andrew pay for his arrogance.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And when the assassin Mose threatened their safety, it was Osborne who boldly took a seat nearest to him, shielding them from danger.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Rhett was severely injured and humiliated by Cuthbert, it was Osborne who had personally helped him recover and then defeated Cuthbert, returning the humiliation in kind.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even when they were in peril, Osborne had used his spatial powers to ensure their escape, staying behind to buy them time so they could safely return to Rosmandi.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As these thoughts swirled in their minds, a wave of guilt washed over Rhett, Stuart, and Vivian, especially Stuart.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just moments ago, he had been mocking Osborne for daring to host an Honor Quest Ceremony as a mere Class AA, eager to witness the Augustine family's embarrassment.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, he wished he could sink into the ground and disappear.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Aleena said coldly, "Hmph, so now you see your mistake?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Remember, the only reason you're still breathing is because of Osborne! Without him, we wouldn't stand a chance against the Eityreia Organization or the Williamson family!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It was Osborne who saved us!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now that he's hosting an Honor Quest Ceremony, while we can't help him in the arena, we'll support him as much as we can behind the scenes!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Right now, I'm taking you to Newport City."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Aleena turned on her heel and strode away. The three exchanged glances, gritted their teeth, and hurried to follow her.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they moved, the younger generation of powerhouses from various superpowers began converging on Newport City in Rosmandi.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The atmosphere in Newport City was quickly becoming lively and bustling.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Osborne remained blissfully unaware of all this commotion. He was deep in the dungeons of the Augustine family, diligently honing his skills.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After he absorbed the death power Emma had given him, his comprehension had skyrocketed. In just four days, Osborne had fully mastered the Destruction Orbs and Disintegration Rays taught to him by the God of Star.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After testing their power, he felt a surge of satisfaction.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The might of the Destruction Orbs and Disintegration Rays rivaled that of Space Collapse, but they were faster to execute, consumed less mental strength, and were trickier to dodge.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When combined with the Light Realm, their power would amplify even further.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These two techniques could easily become his trump cards.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But even so, Osborne knew it wasn't enough.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne had participated in Cuthbert's Honor Quest Ceremony, so he knew all too well just how tough it was to navigate through it flawlessly, defeating every challenger until no one dared to face him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ranked thirty-sixth in the Godson Rankings, Cuthbert had failed to even achieve fifty consecutive wins.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Passing the ceremony meant overcoming at least a hundred challengers.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With his current strength, Osborne felt confident he could easily take down Cuthbert. But when it came to clearing the entire Honor Quest Ceremony, he still doubted his readiness.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he absorbed star power, enhancing his space elemental essence, lightning elemental essence, and mental strength essence, he also focused on understanding Explosive Force.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This technique was crucial for defeating Isa.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he couldn't break through to proficiency level with Explosive Force, his chances against Isa would be nearly nonexistent.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne reminded himself, excitement and pressure coursing through him, "Just ten days left!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is the final push!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne set aside everything else and was fully committed to improving his skills.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Newport City was starting to buzz with energy as the Augustine family's Mount Nine opened its gates, welcoming guests from all around the world.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, the Challenge Peak was beginning to hum with activity.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Each Honor Quest Ceremony was a grand event for the younger generation. Many had already arrived to spar with other elite contenders, sharpening their skills and aiming to make their mark on the Godson Rankings.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At Challenge Peak, three massive arenas had been set up, buzzing with anticipation as young warriors gathered, ready to test their mettle.</p><div class="pagination">
