  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was already extremely familiar with the Glorious Sacrificial Ceremony of the Glorious Divine Kingdom. Since the ceremony took place every ten years, Osborne had experienced it dozens of times in his previous life.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was nothing interesting to him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick would follow the ancient procedure, first worshiping the ancestors, then slaughtering the offerings to invoke the sacrificial power. Half of the descending multicolored sacrificial power would be absorbed by Supreme Overlord Mount, while the other half would be absorbed by Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Doing so could enhance Frederick's strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every king of the Glorious Divine Kingdom valued the decennial sacrifice greatly, as it allowed them to grow stronger more quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even with average talent, they could eventually become a supreme warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With more sacrifices, they could even surpass their limits.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this time, perhaps because Osborne was stronger than in the previous life, he sensed something different.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Where does the power of this sacrifice come from?" Thinking this, Osborne secretly activated Satan's Eye and looked at the seven-colored light descending from the void.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These seven-colored lights were a special energy, not appearing out of thin air but transmitted through a Space-Time Rift.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the previous life, Osborne had no spatial power or time powers, so he noticed nothing unusual.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this time, Osborne felt something was off.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The power of this sacrifice is actually transmitted from a very distant place. Where does this Space-Time Rift lead to?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, at this moment, he was surrounded by warriors, so he couldn't fully use his spatial power to investigate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Primordial's voice echoed in his mind. "This Space-Time Rift naturally leads to the deeper parts of the universe."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Primordial's words, Osborne was stunned. "The deeper parts of the universe?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said calmly, "This sacrifice is to seek power from a powerful being in the deeper parts of the universe. It seems the Glorious Divine Kingdom is not as simple as we thought. It is connected to a powerful being in the deeper parts of the universe."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Perhaps that is the ancestor of the Glorious Divine Kingdom. He didn't die but entered the deeper parts of the universe. Through special sacrificial methods, his descendants can connect with him. Then, he sends back some power to help his descendants enhance their strength."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, due to the vast distance, most of the energy is consumed along the way, leaving only a small portion for his descendants."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even so, being able to channel power back from the depths of the universe to help his descendants is already remarkable. In the mid-level regions of the universe, he is considered a master."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Primordial's words, Osborne felt incredibly shocked. "The secret of the sacrifice is actually like this? The ancestor of the Glorious Divine Kingdom didn't die?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He entered the deeper parts of the universe? The sacrificial methods he left behind were actually to help his descendants enhance their strength, ensuring the Glorious Divine Kingdom could continue? Such methods exist in this world?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This isn't actually difficult," Primordial continued explaining, "Let me use you as an example. If you wanted to help your parents and relatives on Celestara Planet enhance their strength, you could use a similar method. You could leave a special Sacred Artifact on Celestara Planet. From time to time, you could sense the Sacred Artifact and remotely transmit some power to it, then let the Sacred Artifact share part of that power with your parents and relatives."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sacrifice is quite similar to this method. If I'm not mistaken, this Supreme Overlord Mount is the key to the success of the sacrifice. This Supreme Overlord Mount has an extremely strong connection with the ancestor of the Glorious Divine Kingdom. So, even if he's in the deeper parts of the universe, he can still remotely transmit power back."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And the Supreme Overlord Mount didn't keep all the power for itself but shared half of it with the person who initiated the sacrifice."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing Primordial's words, Osborne fully understood and said, "So that's how it is. But which ancestor of the Glorious Divine Kingdom could be so powerful? Could it be Solomon, the founder of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, one of the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet? After all, he was the one who left behind the tradition of sacrifice."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Also, he was born on this Supreme Overlord Mount. When he was born, a phenomenon occurred on this Supreme Overlord Mount. In that case, it's quite normal for him to have a connection with this Supreme Overlord Mount."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, Solomon has long been dead. His tomb is located at the very center of the Royal Sepulcher."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned and looked up at Solomon's tomb in the Royal Sepulcher.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial sneered and said, "Did you see him die with your own eyes? Someone like him possesses an incredibly long lifespan. How could he die so easily? I think he must have ventured into the deeper parts of the universe after reaching Imperial Empyrean Sacredness, and that tomb is definitely empty."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt that Primordial made a lot of sense. "Primordial, do you know how to set up such a sacrificial formation? You can help me set one up on Celestara Planet later."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said calmly, "Are you willing to leave the Bloodwrought Bow on Celestara Planet? Among all your Sacred Artifacts, only the Bloodwrought Bow has a strong connection with you. It's almost becoming a part of your body."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you're willing to leave the Bloodwrought Bow on Celestara Planet, I can help you set up a formation. This formation will allow you to transfer power to the Bloodwrought Bow from afar periodically, helping your relatives on Celestara Planet enhance their strength."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Osborne was stunned. "Is the Bloodwrought Bow the only one that can do this?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment, then gritted his teeth and said, "If one day I really have to leave this Stellar Region and might not return for a long time, I will do it. Although I</span><span>'</span><span>m reluctant to part with the Bloodwrought Bow, my family is more important."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said calmly, "Let's decide when the time comes. The ritual is almost over."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the colorful light descending from the sky gradually dimmed. All of it flowed into the Supreme Overlord Mount and Frederick's body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The members of the Royal Family standing behind Frederick also received a portion. However, the amount was small, only enough to slightly enhance their strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, this was already quite good.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, they undergo the ritual every ten years. This means they inexplicably receive the ritual's power and enhancement every decade. After accumulating it a few times, they can easily distance themselves from others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is the key to why the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom can always remain powerful and why their members improve faster than others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the last ray of colorful light absorbed by the Supreme Overlord Mount, the Glorious Sacrificial Ceremony came to an end.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The entire process lasted only about half an hour.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne felt that Frederick's energy had become more robust. Frederick had already reached a certain limit, as if he was about to break through his cultivation level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, the power of the ritual was not enough for him to break through. So, at that moment, Osborne saw a trace of disappointment on Frederick's face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Frederick quickly concealed his disappointment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although the Glorious Sacrificial Ceremony had ended, the event was not over. For this once-in-a-decade Glorious Sacrificial Ceremony, the Glorious Divine Kingdom gathered members of the Royal Family, all generals, and high-ranking officials, and also invited leaders of many powerful forces. So, this event naturally wouldn't end so easily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, there were many performances, such as the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After some performances, a tall arena appeared in the massive square.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One person shouted, "Next, the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel will begin. Glorious Divine Emperor, Queen Callista, please jointly review the performance of the young talents of the Glorious Divine Kingdom."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel finally began!</span></p><div class="pagination">
