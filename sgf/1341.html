After breaking through to Superior Deity, he now held an undeniable advantage against the Throng of Transcendent Deity warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the likes of Eliot, the leader of the Lord League, and Emperor Dare of the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization&mdash;some of the most elite Transcendent Deities&mdash;would struggle to withstand even a single blow from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His power had transcended that of a typical Transcendent Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This overwhelming strength was precisely why Apocalypse Harbinger felt such a pressing threat and had ordered everyone to launch a combined attack on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He aimed to overwhelm Osborne with sheer numbers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But little did he know, it wasn't the Dark Deity Legion's coalition that held the advantage; it was Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blood Demon members, it's time to rise and fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne whispered this command in his mind, summoning the Blood Demon members hidden in the Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, ten members activated the keys to the Dimensional Microcosm, opening a portal between their realm and the real world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, ten swirling black vortices materialized around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fully armed and emanating an intimidating aura, the Blood Demon members began to surge forth from the dark whirlpools.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With every portal that opened, more and more of them poured out, and in the blink of an eye, thousands surrounded Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The numbers kept climbing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, a staggering total of four thousand eight hundred Blood Demon members stood encircling Osborne, forming a tight, formidable barrier around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each one of them had achieved the Intermediate Deity level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearly five thousand Intermediate Deities now faced over a thousand Superior Deity and Transcendent Deity foes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, instead of flinching in fear, they radiated an overwhelming bloodlust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing firm and united, they were filled with lethal intent, as if their very essences were coalescing into a singular, terrifying force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apocalypse Harbinger's expression shifted to one of stark disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was astounded to find that the combined might of the Dark Deity Legion's coalition was being overpowered by the Blood Demon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could this be possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the Blood Demon members vastly outnumbered the Dark Deity Legion's coalition&mdash;at least four times more&mdash;their collective strength was only that of Intermediate Deities. Logically, they should have stood no chance against the coalition's powerful Transcendent and Superior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But somehow, the Blood Demons commanded the battlefield with an iron will.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all about teamwork!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apocalypse Harbinger growled under his </span><span>breath,</span><span> frustration etched on his face. Although the coalition's members possessed greater strength, they were scattered and disorganized, lacking any form of synergy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In stark contrast, the nearly five thousand Blood Demon members operated in perfect harmony, each of their auras, powers, and wills intertwining as if they were a single entity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This unity was enough to tip the balance of intimidation in their favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The coalition, sensing the shift, faltered in their advance, stopping abruptly and looking to Apocalypse Harbinger for instructions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight left everyone around dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie and a group of Prophet Alliance members stood in shock, unable to comprehend Osborne's sudden display of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, excitement bubbled within them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having resigned themselves to a grim fate, sure that no one could come to their rescue, they now felt a flicker of hope at the emergence of Osborne and his Blood Demon army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps, against the odds, these nearly five thousand Blood Demon members really could take on the three-way coalition of the Dark Deity Legion and save them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Apocalypse Harbinger let out a cold snort, his eyes icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't expect that you had such a trump card. Our intelligence was grossly flawed, believing the Augustine family of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> to be the weakest among Blue Planet's dominant forces. Now, it seems they are far from the weakest&mdash;quite possibly the strongest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aside from my Dark Deity Legion, no other dominant force on Blue Planet could rival the Augustine family. But do you really think this puts you on equal footing with me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five thousand Intermediate Deities stand no chance against over a thousand Superior and Transcendent Deities!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Apocalypse Harbinger's words rang out, the morale of the allied forces surged, their confidence restored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! We are Superior and Transcendent Deities! Our numbers may be fewer, but the gap isn't insurmountable&mdash;just a fourfold difference. Five thousand Intermediate Deities can't possibly match the might of over a thousand of us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The advantage is ours!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the allied forces' eyes gleamed with ferocity, glaring at the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashamed of their earlier fear, they now sought revenge, eager to restore their pride by annihilating every last Blood Demon member.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned at Apocalypse Harbinger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "This man is no ordinary adversary. Just a few his words have revitalized the allied forces' spirit and infused them with renewed confidence."</span></p><div class="pagination">
