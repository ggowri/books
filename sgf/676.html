That way, I can maximize the effect of the Thunder of Judgment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I need a move that can control the enemy!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne mastered Thunder of Judgment, he began to think of new moves. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would never be satisfied with the pursuit of his own power, and he wanted to become even more powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it's a move that can control the enemy, maybe I can do it with the spatial power! As long as I freeze a space and turn it into a quagmire or prison, I can temporarily trap the enemy so they can't dodge."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He became excited at the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne immediately began trying to do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, his mastery of the spatial power was well established. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he had realized what he had in mind, and he had transformed a 16-foot square area of space into an invisible prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This space was divided from the other spaces. If Osborne wanted to leave, he would have to explode with extreme force and break the barriers of the space directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's call it Spatial Prison!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, giving the move a simple name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he wasn't satisfied with the Spatial Prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The current Spatial Prison doesn't seem firm enough. As long as my strength reaches </span><span>Class AA, it will only take me a few seconds to break it! If I reach Class AAA, maybe I can break it in an instant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Moreover, executing the Spatial Prison consumes too much of my mental strength, so such a move is imperfect. It falls far short of the requirements for actual combat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to find a way to reinforce the Spatial Prison so that I can at least trap the warrior at Class AAA for a few seconds. At the same time, I have to reduce the consumption of mental strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, I only need to execute the Spatial Prison a few times before my mental strength is drained, and I'll never be able to execute anything else.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued to think about this intensely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he utilized his tremendous talent and enlightenment to quickly make up for Spatial Prison's shortcomings, making it increasingly stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If my Spatial Prison continues to become powerful or even perfect, will it become a Spatial Domain?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That question suddenly struck Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of the domain was all about making full use of psychic abilities. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he mastered the Domain, he'd basically master this power and become truly formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt that if his Spatial Prison stayed strong, he would likely transform it into a Spatial Domain in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Spatial Domain, he would be like an almighty god.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne was instantly excited, and he tried harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The day went by so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the sun rose the next day, Osborne finally stopped practicing and began to prepare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today was the day to counterattack </span><span>Dampston</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>My Spatial Prison has become strong enough, and I can imprison a Class AAA warrior for at least one to two seconds. Unfortunately, I don't have a way to solve the problem of mental strength consumption."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With my current mental strength, I can only use the Spatial Prison twice at most. Otherwise, my mental strength will be consumed too much to affect my power.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about it, Osborne shook his head. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew he should be patient. Biting off more than what he could chew wasn&rsquo;t a smart move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I master the Thunder of Judgment and the Spatial Prison, I'll be even stronger than before. If I run into Duke Medusa again, I think I will easily defeat her or even kill her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if I'm surrounded by several warriors who have reached Class AAA, I'll deal with them more easily. Besides, I have Clarissa as my supporter now, the elders of the Augustine family who have reached Class AAA, Caleb, Janet, and even..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's also the Blood Demon Organization!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, a strong intent to fight erupted in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now it's my turn to counterattack the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>! If you don't leave </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, I'll kill you all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking it over, Osborne took Clarissa's hand and went to the training ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb and Janet had already arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone from the Blood Demon Organization, even Isaac, Nathan, Queenie, and Yulissa were already waiting at the training ground at this point, and they were geared up and ready to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne arrived, their eyes were filled with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People from the Blood Demon Organization greeted him respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Greetings</span><span>, Mr. Augustine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The loud shouts nearly shattered the roof of the training ground, leaving Caleb, Janet, and Isaac all dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly and waved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's nice to see you all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, everyone from the Blood Demon Organization stood in neat rows and looked at Osborne expectantly, as if waiting for his</span><span> inspection</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced over everyone and finally saw the younger generation at the branch bloodline of the Augustine family in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned tightly at once.</span></p><div class="pagination">
