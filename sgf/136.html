Only metahumans of level C and above possessed essence, and once their essence was devoured, they would die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Also, Satan's Eye couldn't absorb endlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a limit to the number of essences one could devour. Some could absorb only two, while others could take in three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who could absorb three essences were extremely rare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Godfather's Satan's Eye had absorbed only three elemental essences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't know his limit, but to be safe, he must select the most potent essences to maximize the power of Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a pity that the wind-controlling metahuman named Pamela is dead. Otherwise, I could have absorbed her wind-controlling essence and gained the power to control storms."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne recalled another metahuman, Raymond, a thunder metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond, a Class C+ metahuman, undoubtedly possessed a thunder essence, one of the most potent supernatural elements in terms of offensive capability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thunder elemental essence was what Osborne wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If only I could capture Raymond and absorb his thunder essence. Unfortunately, he's too good at escaping. Donna has faced him three times and never managed to catch him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And I don't even know where he's hiding now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he tries to assassinate Clarissa again, maybe I could personally step in and capture him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this thought, Osborne's eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his current strength, he should be no less than a Class C+ metahuman, especially since Isa said that elemental metahumans had bodies as fragile as glass shards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as he could get close, he wouldn't lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he had a Class B Defensive Soft Armor, capable of withstanding five full-force strikes from any Class B or lower fighter, giving him a chance to withstand attacks and get close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he had an ace up his sleeve!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Cross on his chest contained a strange and vast power that allowed him to transform into a Blood Clan, doubling his strength and speed for a short time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he could easily cripple Raymond with a single punch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Excellent, my target is Raymond now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to claim his thunder essence. Now, we just need to find him. Once we catch him, we'll not only obtain the thunder element essence but also find out why The Aberrants want to kill Clarissa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two birds with one stone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne organized his thoughts and went to find Clarissa and Donna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you want to take the offensive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna was amazed after hearing Osborne's suggestion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "As the head of Ms. Donna Radcliffe's bodyguard, it's my duty to protect her. In my view, passive defense is always inferior. No matter how tight the defense, there will always be a flaw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our defenses, even if prosperous a hundred times, are useless because a single failure is unacceptable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He concluded. "The best defense is offense!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I think the Radcliffe family must deploy all its intelligence capabilities to locate Raymond's hideout. Then, I'll lead a team to capture him alive and eliminate the threat once and for all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Radcliffe family has been operating in Skyefall for centuries. With some sacrifice, finding Raymond's hideout shouldn't be a problem, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished, Donna's mouth fell open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne not only wanted to strike first but even to capture Raymond alive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having clashed with Raymond three times, she knew how formidable and tricky his abilities were. And Osborne thought he could capture Raymond alive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna felt Osborne was way out of his depth.</span></p><div class="pagination">
