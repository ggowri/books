  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha! I am back! Let this world tremble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After draining every drop of blood energy from Osborne, Mosley felt a rush of power surging through her. With this influx, her wounds would heal significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What she didn't realize, however, was that Osborne's heart was still beating weakly within his desiccated body. A blood-red cross began to glow, slowly channeling its strength into him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne, who had nearly succumbed to darkness, felt an electrifying jolt of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, elation flooding his senses, "How could I have forgotten?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Deity may drain my blood, but she's not the only one with the power to suck blood! I can do it, too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne tapped into the colossal power of the Blood Cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vampire Transformation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, his body underwent a drastic metamorphosis. Horrifying energy erupted from the Blood Cross, merging with his cells.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hair grew wildly, transforming into a cascade of crimson locks, each strand shimmering like blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sharp fangs sprouted from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fingers elongated into deadly claws, glinting like daggers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His complexion turned pale and angular, giving him an otherworldly appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, Osborne morphed into a Vampire, his hair extending like countless vines, wrapping around Mosley's massive form, piercing through her wounds and invading her flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Suck!" Osborne roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His blood-red hair became thousands of straws, wildly siphoning blood energy from Mosley's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a moment ago, Mosley had relished in the afterglow of draining Osborne's energy, laughing maniacally at her imminent escape from this wretched place, envisioning how she would enslave the world and turn every living soul into her blood feast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the blink of an eye, Osborne had transformed into a Vampire. His crimson hair ensnared her tightly, invading her body and voraciously consuming her blood energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed at which his hair drained her energy surpassed even her own mouth part.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She screamed, "No!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible? You can't possibly consume my blood energy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! Just stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mosley's frantic shouts echoed, but her body was ensnared by the blood-red hair, leaving her unable to break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the divine power sealed away by the invasion of Osborne's hair, there was no way for her to escape the binding grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock and fear flickered in Mosley's eyes as she felt her blood energy drain away like a dam breaking under pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was in a frenzy, desperately trying to stop the onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting her teeth, Mosley attempted to channel her own mouth part to draw Osborne's energy first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me feed! Suck it all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mosley roared, her grotesque mouth part radiating a powerful glow as she struggled to absorb Osborne's energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the speed of her single mouth part paled in comparison to the countless crimson tendrils feasting upon her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More and more blood energy flowed from her into Osborne, and as the life force surged within him, his once-pale complexion began to flush with vitality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a terrifying force, like molten lava, flooding into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mosley was a true deity, and the blood energy she possessed was divine&mdash;a power so immense that Osborne felt his body straining to contain it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, the Blood Cross intervened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pulsing within Osborne's heart like a filter, the Blood Cross shattered the divine energy from Mosley, breaking it down into a form that Osborne could absorb, infusing every cell in his body with renewed vigor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could distinctly sense his body growing stronger, each cell radiating with a faint glow of vitality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it soon became clear that his flesh and blood cells couldn't handle any more of the energy. If he continued, his body might burst apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mosley was still roaring in fury. Her body was brimming with enormous amounts of blood energy, and Osborne had only absorbed a fraction of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression turned grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that if he couldn't drain every last drop of her energy, if she managed to break free, his life would be forfeit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth and made a decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since my flesh can't take any more, I'll use my bones to absorb it! Bones are sturdier and won't burst so easily!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He channeled the immense blood energy into his skeletal structure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, his bones began to transform, adapting to accommodate the torrent of power.</span></p><div class="pagination">
