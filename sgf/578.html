  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd gasped as they noticed Matthew's arrival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Lance's face turned grave, his eyes reflecting a fierce determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew's fleeting glance at Lance was dismissive, as though he couldn't be bothered, leaving Lance's face flushed with humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could sense the palpable disdain, which was a blow to his pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his anger, Lance remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew strode into the Third Estate, his gaze hardening as he surveyed the fallen members of Ransford.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he fixed his gaze on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you do this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow and responded coolly, "Yes, I did."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good, at least you're honest," Matthew said with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've broken the family rules by starting a fight and seriously injuring clan members. As the Deputy Captain of the Augustine family's Punishment Squad, I'm here to deal with you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"According to the rules, you're to be thrown into the dungeon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For a month!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gasps rippled through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? A whole month in the dungeon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne is done for! A month in there, and he'll lose his mind!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is terrible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's brow furrowed. "A month in the dungeon? On what grounds? I won first place in Branch Bloodline Competition. I should have the right to choose where I live. If they refuse to move out, shouldn't I be allowed to take action?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew's smirk grew colder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So you're Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've heard about your arrogance, and now that I see it for myself, it's clear the rumors were right. You really are full of yourself. I've already handed down your punishment, and you still dare to argue?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think that just because you're the heir apparent, you're on equal footing with me? That's laughable. I'm not only a future heir, but also the Deputy Captain of the Punishment Squad. When someone breaks the rules, it's my job to enforce the punishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't think that being an heir or even an elder gives you immunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I say you're guilty, then you are!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you dare to defy me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew looked at Osborne with scorn and a glint of menace in his eyes. "If you resist, your punishment will be even harsher. You'll be expelled from the Augustine family. Don't say I didn't warn you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face darkened further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His martial art aura flared as he murmured, "So, you say I'm guilty and that's enough to sentence me? That's a lot of bravado. What if I refuse to go to the dungeon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like you're ready to fight back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think because you won the branch competition, you can challenge me? If you want to resist, then I'll have to deal with you personally and show you just how big the gap between us really is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew cracked his neck, a surge of power rippling through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne dared to resist, he would strike without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a distance, Lance watched with a smirk, his eyes brimming with both scorn and pity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd's faces were also etched with sympathy for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Matthew's the Deputy Captain of the Punishment Squad. Osborne is really digging his own grave by arguing with him. He's finished!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard Matthew is the most ruthless of the four heirs. Anyone who crosses him ends up in a bad spot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Matthew's clearly targeting Osborne on purpose!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne's done for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's going to get a serious beating from Matthew. No matter how strong Osborne is, he's no match for Matthew! A month in the dungeon, and he'll miss Godfather's birthday party."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's in deep trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd's sympathy for Osborne was evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was red with anger. He felt like Matthew was deliberately coming after him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had only taken action because Ransford refused to leave the Third Estate. It wasn't his fault, but Matthew insisted he had instigated the fight and injured his own clan members, breaking the rules.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew's punishment was a month in the dungeon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne resisted, he risked expulsion from the Augustine family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fists clenched, his rage palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew, however, wore a cold, mocking smile, seemingly enjoying the situation and hoping to provoke Osborne further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, don't be a fool!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Isaac stepped in, grabbing Osborne's arm and shaking his head with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, going up against the Punishment Squad is serious business. You could really be expelled from the Augustine family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't act on impulse. Go to the dungeon first. I'll speak to the higher-ups in the main bloodline. This isn't entirely your fault, and I'll make sure they understand. You won't suffer unjustly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac's urgent plea was meant to calm Osborne down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was still grim, his frustration evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as Isaac pointed out, defying the Punishment Squad was a serious crime that could lead to expulsion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that happened, he wouldn't complete Godfather's sixth trial, and he couldn't save Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking a deep breath, Osborne replied coldly, "Fine. I'll go to the dungeon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I'm not admitting guilt. I'll remember this day. We'll see how things unfold!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne restrained his aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's just a dungeon. Let's see how long you can keep me locked up!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
