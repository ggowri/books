  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it! It's worth a shot!" Osborne thought, shaking off any lingering hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew he had to act quickly. If he could get away with it, great; if not, safety was his top priority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne zeroed in on the nearest Sanctuary Casket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This one stood out among the hundred; while the others were massive&mdash;some over six feet long and one even reaching a staggering 16 feet&mdash;this particular Casket was surprisingly small, measuring only about five feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It looked like it could only fit a small child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, while the other Caskets were a deep black, this one was an unusual, pristine white, making it even more intriguing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne decided to give it a try.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting a moment, he tore open a dimensional rift, aiming to swallow the white Sanctuary Casket into his Dimensional Space, just like the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as he tried, his expression hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Dimensional Space seemed couldn't swallow the Sanctuary Casket whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on?" he muttered in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne attempted to draw in another Casket, only to find the same result.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be because there's a living being inside? I can absorb the empty ones, but the ones with life... that's a problem. Am I really going to have to carry it out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of indecision, Osborne resolved to take at least one Sanctuary Casket with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he had to haul it away, he was determined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He approached the white Casket, expecting it to be light, but to his astonishment, it felt incredibly heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It must weigh two, even 20 million pounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with his formidable strength, lifting it was no easy feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, Osborne pressed on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he managed to get a grip on the Casket, he felt it tremble slightly, causing his heart to race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is a Deschanel family deity about to wake up?" Osborne thought, his mind racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hesitated for a moment but then quickly unleashed a surge of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the unconscious Deschanel family warriors, one stirred slightly, caught in a hazy state between sleep and wakefulness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but smirk. "Ha! These must be treasures! The Deschanel family gods have managed to survive all this time, thanks to these little gems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What luck! But now they're mine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got to bring these treasures back to the League of Divine Descent! My gods will awaken soon, and they'll definitely appreciate this haul!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I present these treasures to them, they'll reward me handsomely! Plus, with so many Deschanel family deities stirring, they must be plotting something big. They could become our League of Divine Descent's greatest rivals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to get this news back to them so they can awaken the gods sooner rather than later. If the Deschanel family decides to strike first, we might not stand a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once the gods are awake, we'll crush the Deschanel family and prevent them from awakening even more deities... That's the plan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne spoke in a gravelly voice, glancing at the half-conscious Deschanel warrior with a cruel smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was setting the League of Divine Descent up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By framing the League of Divine Descent for the theft of the Sanctuary Casket, Osborne felt no guilt whatsoever. If he succeeded, the Deschanel family would likely hold off on attacking the Augustine family for a while, buying him precious time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the eyes of the Deschanel family, the threat posed by the League of Divine Descent far outweighed that of Newport City's Augustine family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only reason they chose to deal with the Augustine family first was their proximity and shared allegiance to the Rosmandi region.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They aimed to first subdue the Augustine family and establish dominance over Rosmandi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scoffed, thinking, "Well, Deschanel family, you're in for a treat! Why don't you focus on the League of Divine Descent first? Trying to dominate the world? The League is your true nemesis!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished that thought, Osborne felt the white Sanctuary Casket vibrating more intensely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No longer daring to linger, he bolted out of the Deschanel family's sanctuary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once outside, Osborne didn't immediately employ interdimensional travel. Instead, he utilized Light Power to blaze a trail, hurtling toward the deep sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A complete frame-up required thoroughness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was now heading deep into the ocean, beyond which lay Marcelin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most formidable Divine Family of the League of Divine Descent, the Thornberry family, resided in Marcelin! The League's headquarters was also established there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne deliberately left behind a trace of light elemental energy, ensuring the Deschanel family would be convinced that the thief of the Sanctuary Casket was indeed from the League of Divine Descent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dashing several hundred miles, Osborne felt the white Sanctuary Casket on his shoulder vibrating even more violently. He finally paused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Employing interdimensional travel, he instantly reappeared 600 miles away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By now, the Sanctuary Casket was vibrating intensely, with a faint energy surge seeping out, as if something within was about to break free.</span></p><div class="pagination">
