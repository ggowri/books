  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression shifted dramatically as surprise washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt the Blood Cross within him stir violently, almost as if it were a shark sensing blood in the water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air around them was thick with the scent of blood, and the Blood Cross seemed eager to absorb the rich energy surrounding it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the God Binding Rope held it back, trapping the Blood Cross and fueling its rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could feel the intensity of its vibrations, and at that moment, he sensed the </span><span>seal of the God Binding Rope loosening just a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A spark of hope ignited within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly settled into a cross-legged position, focusing intently on aligning with the Blood Cross to break free from the God Binding Rope's grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his astonishment, George's brutal act of murder inadvertently provided him with an opportunity to escape his dire situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Blood Cross thrashed against its restraints, the God Binding Rope's hold weakened further. Osborne felt a trickle of power returning to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't much, but it was enough to fill him with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne realized he was on the verge of breaking free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, half an hour had passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George reappeared, dragging another Draco Armed Services Branch captive behind him. Upon seeing Osborne still in the same spot, rage contorted his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for it! Looks like you're not a fan of my little game. Fine! I'll just kill them all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, George stepped closer to Osborne, lifting the captive high into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fierce wind howled around George, morphing into invisible blades ready to slice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He taunted, "Remember, they're dying because of you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're the real murderer here! They're suffering and dying in agony because of you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see you get cut to pieces!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George bellowed, unleashing a flurry of wind blades aimed at the captive, intending to shred him into a thousand bloody pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair filled the captive's eyes as he realized his fate was sealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, Osborne lifted his head, icy determination etched on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"George, you're dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Light Realm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a powerful Light Realm erupted, enveloping George in its brilliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wind blades aimed at the captive shattered in an explosion of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George's face paled in disbelief as he stared at Osborne. "How is this possible? You regained your power? That's impossible! The God Binding Rope is a top-grade divine artifact! Even a top-tier Class S powerhouse can't break free from its seal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could you possibly regain your strength?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled. "Surprised? You should be terrified! Because I'm going to return the torment you inflicted on me tenfold! You'll experience the most excruciating pain!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After half an hour of relentless effort, he had finally synchronized with the Blood Cross and shattered the God Binding Rope's seal, regaining his full power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, it was George's turn to feel fear!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Osborne appeared next to George, delivering a powerful kick to his chest. The sheer force was beyond anything George could handle, shattering his ribs and devastating his internal organs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood sprayed from George's mouth as he was sent flying backward, terror etched </span><span>across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He attempted to retaliate, but before he could react, Osborne was upon him again, kicking him further away with a brutal strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George's body flew through the air like a deflated blimp, crashing to the ground in a pitiful heap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His screams were piercing and desperate, but they could not reach beyond the confines of Light Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet for Osborne, that wasn't enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Light of Redemption!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne unleashed the healing power, watching as George's injuries vanished, his form restored to peak condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said with a mocking smile, "Do you really think killing you once will quench my fury?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You enjoy tearing flesh apart into thousands of pieces, right? Well, it's time you experience that sensation yourself! Watch as I slice you into a million little pieces!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that declaration, Osborne manifested the Goddess of Grain's scythe in his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was determined to personally dismember George, relishing every scream of anguish that erupted from George, forcing him to endure the most profound agony before using the Light of Redemption to snatch him back from the brink of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he would do it all over again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne activated the Light Realm. With every three minutes that passed, he could wield the power of Light of Redemption once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this twisted dance of torment, George would find death elusive, unable to escape the horrors awaiting him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each time, he'd face unimaginable suffering, his body wracked with pain, his cries echoing chillingly through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne felt no mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cycle continued as Osborne relentlessly tormented George.</span></p><div class="pagination">
