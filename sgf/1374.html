  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was withered beyond recognition, and in its current state, it could no longer aid Osborne in healing or recovery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had also lost his immortality, albeit temporarily, and the gravity of the situation weighed heavily on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without the Lotus' power, if he were to die again, it might truly be the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His injuries were far too severe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Divine Body, once transformed to Level Nine, now felt as if it had been shattered. In reality, it barely resembled even a Level Two Divine Body; it was more akin to the most ordinary form of divine essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every inch of him was riddled with wounds, and the weight of his injuries severely limited his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't dare unleash his full power, as even the slightest exertion sent waves of pain coursing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, even facing a mere Junior Deity seemed like an insurmountable challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a deep sense of helplessness and anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no idea where he was. "With injuries this debilitating, how can I possibly defend myself if danger lurks nearby? Am I doomed to wait for death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He attempted to cast the Light of Redemption on himself, but the effort yielded little to no effect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My injuries... they're all from those horrifying tree roots. Even the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity would struggle to mend this damage, let alone the Light of Redemption.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looks like I'll have to take my time healing. I just hope my current situation isn't too perilous! I need to figure out a way to restore the Lotus a bit; only with its help can I hope to recover fully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And with the Lotus withering, my connection to the Blood Demon members has been severed! I can only wonder how they're faring in the Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with the protection of the Lotus' essence, they should still be alive! Grandpa and Anastasia... they must still be out there! Once the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity regains some strength, I can open a portal to the Dimensional Microcosm and </span><span>reach out to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damn those roots!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but curse under his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for those roots, he would have quickly elevated his space elemental essence to Level Seven, and escaping the depths of space would have been a breeze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His power would have surged, and everything would have been different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, everything was in ruins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all the God of Time's fault!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those dreadful tree roots!" Osborne lamented internally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, those terrifying roots were undoubtedly a form of Cosmic Treasure, perhaps even more powerful than the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity itself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They seemed to be arch-enemies of the Lotus, intent on devouring it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This thought sent a chill down his spine, amplifying his sense of urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity might have escaped this time, but those roots won't just let it go. They'll come after it again, and if the Lotus is in this state, it won't withstand another attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I need to recover quickly and regain my strength! I have to become stronger to fend off the roots!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Osborne heard footsteps approaching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart raced as he sensed two figures drawing near&mdash;one with the power of a Junior Deity, the other an Intermediate Deity. There was no way he could handle them in his current state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grimacing against the pain, Osborne tried to slip into the parallel space to assess the situation, but the next moment, a sharp gasp escaped his lips, and agony washed over his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't enter the parallel space!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His injuries weren't just limited to his Divine Body; even his elemental essence had taken a severe hit, rendering him unable to summon any power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne forced himself to tap into his spatial power, the strain only aggravated his wounds, causing him to groan in pain, sweat beading on his forehead as he nearly collapsed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait... what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A light gasp broke the air, followed by hurried footsteps. A man and a woman raced towards him, urgency driving their every move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're awake?" The woman exclaimed, her face smudged with dirt and ash, her surprise evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the pain etched on Osborne's features, she rushed to support him, propping him up with a firm grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's awake!" she called out, her voice a mix of relief and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man </span><span>approached,</span><span> his brow furrowed in concern. He regarded Osborne with a wary gaze, increasing the tension in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained silent, giving both of them an equally cautious look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces were smeared with soot, and their clothes were ragged and filthy&mdash;almost as if they had just emerged from the depths of a coal mine, which struck him as odd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the woman being a Junior Deity, the yellow Divine Flame flickering above her head signified that she possessed a Level Three Divine Body. This was quite remarkable; even among the brightest in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, having a Level Three Divine Body at Junior Deity status marked her as a prodigy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And her brother, too, bore the same yellow flames atop his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These two people were undoubtedly talented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man asked suddenly, his tone sharp with suspicion, "Who are you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We found you buried deep in a mine while we were digging. Are you a miner from our sector? What's your ID number? How did you end up like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you cross paths with a Dark Deity overseer? Did he beat you to a pulp and toss you down here? If so, you need to get out of here fast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't afford to be pulled into whatever mess you're in!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
