  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Brenda's command, the crowd became somewhat chaotic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, they had been working together for two days and were already quite familiar with each other, so they quickly reacted, and each group sprang into action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The defense team prepared defensive measures on the perimeter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The attack team had already launched their strikes at the charging Ice Beetles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The mobility team and the healing team were also ready.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The reconnaissance team quickly surveyed the surroundings, looking for better combat areas and retreat routes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone reacted quickly, but this time their opponent was completely different from any they had faced before&mdash;this Ice Beetle swarm numbered as many as 30,000.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But their numbers were less than 800.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When the attack team's assault ended, everyone realized the urgency of the situation, as only a small portion of the Ice Beetles had been killed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>More Ice Beetles completely withstood their attacks and kept charging swiftly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each of them was only the size of a fist, but when they charged together, they created an overwhelming pressure like a giant beast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dammit! The Ice Beetles' defense is too strong!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The attack team had the largest number, a total of 500 people. Yet, the 500 of them together only managed to kill a few hundred Ice Beetles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These few hundred Ice Beetles were only killed because they endured too many attacks at once.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Compared to the 30,000-strong Ice Beetle swarm, the death of these few hundred was nothing. In an instant, the Ice Beetles were already right in front of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the defense team began to take action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They each activated their Defensive Sacred Artifacts, forming layers of defense in front of everyone, hoping to block the Ice Beetles' attacks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But unfortunately, they failed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Ice Beetles swarmed in. Their transparent wings carried ice power, attacking their defenses like ice blades.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud crash, the defensive barrier was instantly shattered. Many in the defense team were injured, coughing up blood, their faces pale.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The healing team didn't hesitate and rushed to save people.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We can't hold them off!" the defense team shouted in panic. The Ice Beetles were too powerful; with tens of thousands attacking together, their defense team of less than two hundred couldn't possibly stop their assault.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if the defense team had ten times more people, it would still be hard to fend off the attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hurry! Kill them all!" As the Ice Beetles approached, everyone started to panic again. Brenda shouted loudly, trying to calm everyone down, but it was useless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The situation was getting worse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, an Ice Beetle broke into their battle formation, unleashing sharp ice blades that shattered their defenses. People began getting injured by the ice blades.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Piercing screams echoed everywhere. The medical team was overwhelmed. People started dying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the number of dead was rapidly increasing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone used various methods to fight the Ice Beetles. Some unleashed flames, others wielded lightning, some emitted a death scent, and some summoned tides. But all these methods had limited effects on the Ice Beetles. While they could kill them, the pace was far too slow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this rate, by the time they eliminate all the Ice Beetles, less than half of them might still be alive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Brenda, think of something quickly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Didn't you say you had a way to deal with the Ice Beetles? If you don't act now, we're going to be killed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone shouted loudly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda replied, "Of course, I have a way to deal with the Ice Beetles! But using it comes at a great cost to me. Unless it's absolutely necessary, I can't use it lightly..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was surprised </span><span>by</span><span> her words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But someone understood her meaning and said, "Brenda, quickly use your method! As long as you can deal with the Ice Beetles, we can allocate more loot to you..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda showed a hesitant, thoughtful expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a while, as the situation became critical, she finally agreed, "Alright! But we need to clarify first, how much loot will you give me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ten percent! As long as you can deal with the Ice Beetles, you alone will get ten percent of the loot!" someone shouted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda shook her head and refused, "No way! That's too little! I want fifty percent!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone showed surprised expressions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were 800 of them. Brenda alone getting ten percent of the loot meant the rest would share ninety percent, yet she was still not satisfied and wanted to take fifty percent for herself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She's too greedy!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's impossible!" someone shouted angrily. "Brenda, you're the one who brought us to the glacier region. Now we're in danger, and you want fifty percent of the loot before helping. You've betrayed our trust in you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's right! Brenda, did you do this on purpose? You must have predicted this situation and tricked us into coming here, didn't you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Brenda..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda calmly said, "Think whatever you want! I told you I do have a way to deal with the Ice Beetle, but it comes at a great cost! If there's not enough benefit for me, why should I help?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With my abilities, I can live perfectly fine here on my own! Why should I help you? You're nothing but a burden to me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I want fifty percent of the loot, and that's not unreasonable! If you have a way to deal with the Ice Beetle, I won't take any loot!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But can you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone fell silent. They had tried all kinds of methods, but the results were poor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then I'll change the distribution method!" Brenda said at this moment, "Taking fifty percent of the loot for myself is indeed a bit excessive! But since I paid the price, I can't suffer a loss either, so I demand that all the Ice Beetles I kill belong to me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you agree, I'll deal with them! If not, let's disband early and survive on our own abilities."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone began to think.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the urgent situation left them no time to think further. Letting Brenda keep all the Ice Beetles she killed didn't seem unreasonable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone shouted, "Alright! We agree! All the Ice Beetles you kill are yours, they're your loot, and we won't distribute them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She achieved her goal!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She quickly took out a scepter. At the top of the scepter was an icy blue gem, crystal clear and exuding a chilling aura.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, try to gather the Ice Beetles together! I can only attack once," Brenda ordered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone took action. Killing the Ice Beetles was difficult, but finding a way to gather them together wasn't hard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, most of the Ice Beetles were gathered in one area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Brenda made her move. "Ice Scepter, Freeze!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Ice Scepter unleashed a terrifying burst of ice power, instantly enveloping the group of Ice Beetles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All the Ice Beetles in the area, a total of twenty thousand, were completely frozen!</span></p><div class="pagination">
