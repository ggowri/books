Is a full-scale war about to begin?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, every member of the Human Alliance felt as though a mountain was pressing down on them, an overwhelming sense of terrifying pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>War meant death, especially when two races clashed in an all-out conflict.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a war between ten billion from the Human Alliance and fifty billion of the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could the Human Community withstand this onslaught?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would they survive?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These questions raced through the minds of every Human Alliance member, their hearts heavy with anxiety and fear. Coupled with Icy One's oppressive aura, their bodies shook with foreboding, and morale sank to the lowest depths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, the God of Light scoffed, dissipating Icy One's murderous aura with a single thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression hardened, a fierce battle spirit igniting within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Icy One! You don't need to stoop to such underhanded tactics! You think you can force us to surrender to your Paramount Supreme Clan? Dream on! We'd rather die standing than live on our knees! We'd rather fall on the battlefield than become your vassals or slaves!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So if it's a fight you want, then let's fight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We might lose many, but don't you dare think your Paramount Supreme Clan will walk away unscathed! Bring it on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a raised arm, the God of Light's fierce determination suddenly resonated with the Human Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments ago, they were filled with panic, but now, they felt a rush of anger that colored their vision red as they shouted in unison with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bring it on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bring it on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bring it on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The roar of over ten billion voices shook the heavens, their fierce battle spirit bursting forth like a tempest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon witnessing this, the God of Light breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While a powerful fighting spirit might not secure victory in a daunting battle, a plummeting morale could turn a tough struggle into a complete rout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the spirit of the Human Alliance was still aflame, reignited by her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the God of Light felt a rush of adrenaline&mdash;the courage and strength coursing through her veins made her feel invincible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised her arm once more. "The Human Community will prevail!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With fervor, the ten billion members of the Human Alliance mirrored her, their faces flushed with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community will prevail!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community will prevail!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Victory is ours!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that decisive moment, their indomitable spirit blew away the dark clouds above.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's expression soured, realization dawning upon him&mdash;he had miscalculated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought that by announcing the start of the war publicly, he would shatter the Human Alliance's morale. Instead, the God of Light had turned the tables, propelling their spirits to new heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Icy One shook off the disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>War wasn't a fair competition; it wasn't a mere sparring match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He commanded fifty billion warriors from the Dark Deity Legion, while the Human Alliance barely mustered ten billion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of numbers and strength, the Dark Deity Legion had the upper hand. No amount of high morale could shield the Human Alliance from the relentless tide of the Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold, cruel smile, he declared, "God of Light, your foolishness has robbed these people of their last chance at life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because of your blunders, the Human Community in the West Zone will be wiped out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, you want war, do you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll grant your wish!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Troops of the Dark Deity Legion, listen up!

They didn't need to aim; all they had to do was unleash their fury on the enemies before them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if two raging torrents collided, sending violent waves crashing into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Limbs, severed arms, shattered skulls, and mangled flesh littered the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the heavens seemed to weep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood soaked the earth, and bodies fell like autumn leaves, thousands perishing every second, only to be quickly replaced by new combatants rushing to the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this brutal clash, both the Human Alliance and the Dark Deity Legion left countless corpses in their wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light clenched her fists, her eyes blazing with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This war should never have happened!

You should be commanding your Human Alliance from the rear.
