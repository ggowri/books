  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll put the Draco Armed Services Branch in charge of security here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In its prime, the Draco Armed Services Branch boasted impressive strength, with over 5,000 personnel&mdash;including nearly 200 Class AAA experts and more than 1,000 Class AA elite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This formidable force had once stood as the pinnacle of power in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, maintaining stability for the Draco Group and keeping various factions at bay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they might not be more powerful than top-tier superpowers like the League of Divine Descent or the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, the Draco Armed Services Branch still ranked solidly as the upper level of superpowers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne knew their current capabilities were lacking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> launched a sudden assault with a horde of Class S and Class AAA clones, targeting the Draco Armed Services Branch based in the 6 coastal provinces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The aftermath was tragic. Over 3,000 members of the branch had died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the branch had only about 1,500 remained, with over 80 still classified as Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While this remaining force was still powerful&mdash;far exceeding factions like the Lambert family&mdash;Osborne found it lacking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His own elite unit, the Blood Demon, consisted of 4,800 fully-fledged Class AAA members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For defense, it made much more sense to have the Draco Armed Services Branch guard those research facilities, which were unlikely to face a large-scale attack, while the Blood Demon members protected the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that decision made, Osborne set things into motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, 10,000 Crystals of Life were prepared for him to take into his Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Satisfied that everything was in order, Osborne went back to the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder if the 100 members of the Blood Demon Vanguard have been selected yet? Let me go check on that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon reaching Mount Three of the Augustine family, he found a vast training ground </span><span>occupied by just 100 Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them got visible injuries, indicating the fierce battles they had just fought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest were either resting or patrolling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These 100 members were the cream of the crop, emerging from a hard-fought struggle. They would form the first batch of the Blood Demon Vanguard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they saw Osborne arrive, they all stood to attention, their eyes burning with pride and excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine!" they shouted in unison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, taking in their condition. He said, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like you just had a tough fight! You all did very well. From this moment on, you are the inaugural members of the Blood Demon Vanguard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But don't slack off! I'm going to equip you with the best weapons and gear first, and you'll get priority for blood energy. If any of you lag behind and let your strength be outpaced by others, you'll find yourself replaced!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sir!" they roared back, their voices echoing like thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some among them, however, were so injured that the sheer force of their shout opened their wounds, blood splattering forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, they didn't care. There&rsquo;s no change in their determined looks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were true warriors!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a swell of pride as he turned to one of the most injured members, beckoning him closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man hurried over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's your name?" Osborne asked calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>" Mr. Augustine! I'm Ninety-third Augustine!" he replied loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you so badly hurt?" Osborne inquired, taking note of the severe gash in his abdomen that revealed glimpses of his insides, only hastily bandaged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Multiple bones seemed broken beneath the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I got hurt because I wanted to win! I'm determined to join the Blood Demon Vanguard!" Ninety-third exclaimed, with his fervor undiminished by his injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ninety-third stood before Osborne, the hastily bandaged wound on his abdomen burst open, blood gushing forth and draining the color from his face. But he stood upright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath, his voice steady. "You're doing great!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ninety-third's injuries were severe, but being a Class AAA warrior, he had remarkable vitality and a powerful recovery ability. Even without treatment, he wouldn't die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Complete healing would likely take about a week, but that was still too long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the battlefield, a wound like that would make him useless for high-intensity combat for the next several days, even if he survived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me put the Crystal of Life to the test!" Osborne thought, reaching into his Dimensional Space to take one of the shimmering crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He handed it to Ninety-third, his expression serious. "Absorb the vitality within."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation or question, Ninety-third grasped the Crystal of Life tightly and began to absorb its energy as directed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What happened next left everyone in stunned silence. In just three minutes, the heavy </span><span>injuries that would take at least a week to heal began to heal at an astonishing rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did Ninety-third's wounds close, but he also seemed to be in even better shape than before he had been hurt!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't hide his astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Three minutes to recover from such a severe injury? If he gets skilled at this, the speed of absorption will only increase, and recovery will be even quicker!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Crystal of Life on hand, as long as one doesn't lose his head, he's practically immortal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if his heart gets pierced, I bet he could bounce back from that!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
