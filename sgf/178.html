  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne spoke, Valentin was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he was initially worried, seeing Osborne's calm demeanor and sensing his confidence, Valentin also calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Osborne, he felt the power of self-assurance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, tell me what to do, and I'll do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, the mass departure of temporary bodyguards will significantly reduce our strength. And Chevalier Security's power has already far surpassed ours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged indifferently. "A significant reduction in strength? I don't think so. Valentin, are the hundred or so people who remain absolutely reliable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course. Including me, there are one hundred and twenty people left, one hundred and ten ordinary members and ten core managers, all from the Godfather's training camp. No one knows their identities, but they are all loyal to the Godfather, to the Draco Group, and to you. They are the core backbone of Skyefall Security."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up as he asked again, "And how about their equipment?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Equipment?" Valentin paused, then replied. "According to company regulations, ordinary members are equipped with Class-D single-soldier gear from the Draco Group, while the ten senior managers, including myself, are equipped with Class C single-soldier gear."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, he said, "How much money is in the company's account?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin answered, "About 300 million dollars. At the end of each year, our profits are submitted to the headquarters. It's March now, so there's only 300 million dollars. However, after installing this Class A defense system and once the Radcliffe family approves, we'll receive five hundred million, bringing the total to 800 million dollars in cash."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, "Eight hundred million dollars? Not enough. Far from it. Valentin, I plan to upgrade the equipment for all one hundred and twenty current members. Ordinary members to Class C single-soldier gear, and senior managers to Class B single-soldier gear. In this case, will our strength decrease compared to before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin was stunned, incredulously saying, "Are you sure you want to do that? That would mean buying one hundred sets of Class C gear and ten sets of Class B gear. That's a huge amount of money! We don't even have the purchasing authority for that. But if we do this, our strength won't just stay the same. It will greatly increase. The combat power will definitely be much stronger than the previous one thousand plus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded in satisfaction, smiling, "Don't worry about the money, and as for the purchasing authority, I happen to have it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook the Draco Star Wristlet on his wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Draco Star Wristlet had already lit up three stars, representing his three-star authority, which allowed him to purchase Class B single-soldier gear from the Draco Group and even some Class A gear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he could enjoy a 20% discount.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Draco Star Wristlet's marketplace, a set of Class C single-soldier systems, including weapons and armor, cost about ten million dollars internally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, one hundred sets would be a billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Class B single-soldier gear set would cost about 100 million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most expensive was the Class B defensive soft armor, priced at fifty million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If ten sets were bought, that would be another billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To fully equip the one hundred and twenty members of Skyefall Security would cost at least two billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with a 20% discount, it would still be 1.6 billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Relying solely on Skyefall Security's profits, it was unaffordable. Fortunately, Osborne's account still had more than three billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth and started placing orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After purchasing one hundred sets of Class C single-soldier gear and ten sets of Class B single-soldier gear, half of the money in Osborne's account immediately vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a pang of heartache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One billion and six hundred million dollars, equivalent to the entire assets of an ordinary large family, was spent in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Indeed, arms dealers make money. When will the Godfather reward me with an arms company? Then I'll really be rich," Osborne thought, quickly adjusting his mindset.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he spent 1.6 billion dollars, he felt it was worth it because he knew very well how powerful the Draco Group's Class C and Class B single-soldier gear was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The upgraded equipment of Skyefall Security members would undoubtedly increase their strength several times over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After placing the order, Osborne sneered, "Apollo, since you want to play, I'll play along with you. If you think you can bully me by poaching my employees, then come and try."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, Osborne and Valentin discussed the development plan for Skyefall Security, deciding not to recruit temporary bodyguards anymore and instead focus on the high-end route with the one hundred and twenty core members after upgrading their equipment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That meant that Skyefall Security would only accept high-priced contracts in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew this path wouldn't be easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyefall Security must make a loud enough name for itself, showing the high-end clients their true strength. Otherwise, they wouldn't spend several times, even ten times the high price, to hire Skyefall Security's bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Apollo's acquired Chevalier Security was the perfect opponent for Osborne to make a name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apollo, I'm looking forward to a fight with you."</span></p><div class="pagination">
