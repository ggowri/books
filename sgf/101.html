  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul suddenly cried out for mercy, "Ms. Radcliffe, spare me, please!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In all the years I've dedicated myself to serving the Radcliffe family diligently, please forgive me this time. I was just momentarily led astray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Aberrants threatened me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Radcliffe, let me redeem myself. I can confront the Aberrants. Spare me, please."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa</span><span>, the reinforcement Osborne brought in, swiftly incapacitated Pamela with a single punch, leaving Paul dumbfounded, instantly losing all his fighting spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Already injured, he knew there was no escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from begging for mercy, what else could he do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa, with a stern expression, gazed at Paul and turned to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, how do you suggest we deal with him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, taken aback by Paul's sudden surrender, said, "Such a coward!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Radcliffe, this is your family matter, and I cannot make decisions for you. However, my advice is to eliminate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he can betray you once, he can do it again! Betrayal must come with consequences."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne's statement, Clarissa nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's face contorted in shock as he exclaimed, "You heartless pair! I've begged for mercy, and still, you won't spare me? In that case, before I die, I'll make sure to take someone down with me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, join me in hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a burst of frenzy, Paul lunged towards Clarissa, unleashing all his strength, viciously aiming a punch at her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa remained calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, Osborne appeared in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, looking down on Paul with disdain, remarked, "I knew you'd panic and make one last attempt. Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift punch, Osborne confronted Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, instead of anger, displayed delight. "Haha! Daring to match strength with me head-on, Osborne? Your strength is no match for mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their fists clashed, resulting in the sound of bones breaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul's arm twisted, bone spurs piercing through flesh as he was sent crashing to the ground in agony and shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a pained scream, he exclaimed, "Ah! My hand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible? Why has your strength suddenly increased so much? This can't be!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though physically weaker than Paul, he was a metahuman. His level three Satan's Eye could manipulate matter, with ocular energy transforming into an invisible force, able to lift 2200 pounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By channeling ocular energy into his punch, Osborne could deliver a force stronger than 2200 pounds, which crushed Paul in strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he chose not to explain these details to Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Approaching Paul, Osborne looked down on him, who was akin to a dead dog. In Paul's terrified gaze, Osborne suddenly stomped his foot down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne broke Paul's other arm with a stomp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne didn't stop there. With rapid succession, he crushed Paul's two feet, rendering him completely immobile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul let out a piercing scream, his eyes bloodshot, glaring at Osborne as if trying to kill him with the gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dare to glare at me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then go die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indifferently, Osborne delivered a final blow, crushing Paul's neck with his foot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hope you don't mind me finishing him off?" Osborne asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa hesitated, seeming to want to say something, but ultimately shook her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He had it coming."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, then turned his attention to the distant battle where Bodyguard Unit Three and Bodyguard Unit Four were in. Sharon and Violet were valiantly holding their ground against twenty werewolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sprang into action, assisting them in eliminating the last few werewolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after, Donna returned with a grim expression. Raymond had escaped again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at the lifeless body of Paul with an icy gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She commanded, "Bodyguard Unit Three, maintain vigilance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bodyguard Unit Four, clean up the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll handle the law enforcement team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you protect Clarissa and go help the injured."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With such an incident, they couldn't continue their journey to Skyefall Security Services. Donna quickly made arrangements and personally went to deal with the belated Mayby City law enforcement team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the law enforcement officers, Osborne couldn't help but shake his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosmandi was home to numerous gangs, and incidents of robbery, fights, and shootings were frequent. Wealthy and important figures were accustomed to traveling with a large number of bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After 9 pm, ordinary people dared not venture outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The root cause of the chaotic security situation in Rosmandi was the incompetence of the law enforcement team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a saying in Rosmandi. If the law enforcement team was reliable, what was the point of having a gun?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as one didn't provoke the law enforcement team, they wouldn't bother to intervene in what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head, trying not to dwell on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took Clarissa and began to assist the injured everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, the convoy returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Donna invited Osborne to sit in Clarissa's car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a surge of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "This was Paul's seat. Could it be that I'm going to become the head of the bodyguards?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
