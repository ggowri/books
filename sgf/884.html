  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Scarlett watched as Hound was effortlessly defeated by Osborne, a smile spreading across her face.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She remarked, "This is getting interesting. I thought this Honor Quest Ceremony would be a waste of time, but now it seems there's finally some thrill in the air!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"His mastery over power has reached the peak of Class AAA. If he's got enough tricks up his sleeve, he might just be worthy of a match against me."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, she turned to Marlon, grinning mischievously.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Feeling the pressure, Marlon? Do you think he can pull off a hundred consecutive wins?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marlon scoffed, his expression icy. "Scarlett, whether Osborne can make it to a hundred wins depends entirely on you. I've done the math; if he keeps this pace, his hundredth opponent will be you."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Scarlett blinked in surprise but quickly regained her composure. "Well, that's unfortunate for him. If he'd faced me a little later, he might have actually reached that hundredth win and become the tenth person in history to do so. But alas, he'll have to settle for a maximum of ninety-nine."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marlon smirked, saying, "Scarlett, I'd advise you not to get too cocky. Osborne hasn't shown his true power yet. Who knows? He might just surprise you. Imagine if he steps on your back to claim that hundredth win. You'd be furious."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Scarlett laughed heartily. "You're overestimating him and underestimating me! In the wild, I could take him out without breaking a sweat. Even in the arena, he doesn't stand a chance against me!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marlon shrugged, a teasing glint in his eye. "Well, we'll see about that! I hope you don't end up losing to him, or I might have to step in personally to take him down."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Scarlett retorted with a scoff, "You wouldn't want to get your hands dirty? I heard he fought your sister. Aren't you itching for revenge? Or maybe you're scared you won't be able to get it done? That's why you're hoping I'll handle him for you?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marlon burst into laughter.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Scarlett, you're the one who's misjudging him! He's shown some impressive strength, even stronger than Cuthbert, but he's still no match for me!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My real opponents are the Class S powerhouses, not him! Unless he breaks through to Class S, he doesn't even deserve to be in my league. Of course, if you lose to him, I wouldn't mind taking him down myself. I'll show you that whether in the arena or out in the wild, I'm stronger than you!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Scarlett retorted, her confidence unwavering, "Ridiculous! After I defeat him, I challenge you to a match! I'll prove that I can take you out in the wild just as easily as I can in the arena!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You think I'm afraid of you?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The tension between Marlon and Scarlett crackled in the air; both were determined to prove they were the strongest of their generation.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for Osborne, while he had piqued their interest, they still didn't view him as a true rival.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Honor Quest Ceremony continued, and Osborne's winning streak pressed on.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before long, he had defeated everyone ranked between 400 and 500 on the Godson Rankings, bringing his victory count to sixty-three.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His next opponent was none other than Ebony!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony's face darkened as she watched the matches unfold. Before the Honor Quest Ceremony began, she had felt confident about avenging Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, by the time it was her turn, Osborne would have fought at least sixty or seventy rounds. Even if Osborne was tough as nails, he had to be running low on energy by then.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ebony figured that even if he was stronger than her, she could still take her shot at revenge.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In fact, she had doubted whether he'd even have a chance to reach that many wins at all.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, her confidence had taken a nosedive.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's display of strength had been nothing short of astonishing. While her brother Marlon and Scarlett might not have seen him as a real threat, Ebony knew better&mdash;she stood no chance against him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What weighed on her mind even more was the way Osborne had ruthlessly dismantled every member of the League of Divine Descent.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Opponents had left the arena with broken ribs or knocked-out teeth.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she stepped onto that stage, would she end up just another casualty?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fear gripped her, and Ebony glanced over at Marlon, hoping for reassurance.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He frowned, sensing her hesitation. But his voice was steady as he said, "Ebony, you've got to go up there. If he dares to hurt you, I'll make him pay a hundredfold."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At his words, Ebony felt a weight lift off her shoulders. With newfound determination, she strode confidently toward the arena.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she prepared for her match, Marlon stood up, locking his gaze on Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marlon sent a menacing whisper that only Osborne could hear.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, right? I'm Marlon. Your next opponent is my sister. If you so much as touch a hair on her head, I'll make you wish you were dead.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just remember, play nice, or you won't like the consequences."</p><div class="pagination">
