  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlett smirked, her confidence radiating as she declared, "For me, it's easy to take you down in the wild, and I can do the same here in the arena. You don't stand a chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her pride wasn't just arrogance; it stemmed from her undeniable strength and a track record that spoke for itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her eyes, there was only one person among the younger generation who truly warranted her respect&mdash;Marlon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even Cuthbert made the cut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She believed her full power could easily place her in the top twenty of the Godson Rankings, and if the opportunity arose, she could even take out a Class S Supreme Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that kind of confidence, how could she possibly take Osborne seriously?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne simply smiled, unfazed, "Is that so? I've had plenty of challengers tell me the same thing before, but they only managed to block a couple of my moves. I wonder how many you can manage?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlett </span><span>scoffed,</span><span> her disdain evident. "Comparing me to those losers? You'll regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shrugging, Osborne replied coolly, "Alright then, let's not waste any more time. If you really have what it takes, come at me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlett let out a cold huff. "As you wish! Prepare to witness my true power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she sprang into action, a cruel smile on her face as she waved her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arena trembled violently, and towering trees erupted from thin air. Massive vines twisted and curled, transforming the once flat stage into a vibrant, primal jungle in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Scarlett's Realm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enormous vines intertwined, forming a throne-like structure that lifted Scarlett high above the ground, making her look like a queen of the forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A plant-controlling metahuman? A Plant Realm? And the strength of this Realm... Level Three?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time he had encountered a plant-controlling metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlett's Realm had turned the entire arena into a lush wilderness, with every tree and vine seemingly alive, under her command, ready to be wielded as weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most impressively, her Plant Realm was incredibly stable, the energies woven together like fabric. Combined with her top-tier AAA Class strength, even Osborne would find it difficult to shatter her Realm easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seated on her vine throne, she looked down at Osborne, a smirk on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Osborne, what do you think of my Realm? Do you still believe you can defeat me and achieve your hundred wins?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne maintained his composure with a slight smile playing. "Nice Realm! But if you think this is enough to take me down, you're underestimating me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's put that to the test," Scarlett replied with a cold laugh, her hand slicing through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, every tree and vine around Osborne sprang to life. The vines lashed out like </span><span>whips, striking at him with the force of a raging storm, accompanied by a howling wind that carried a terrifying power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trees swayed gently, their leaves transforming into countless blades that surrounded Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a heartbeat, the assault came crashing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned fierce as he activated his martial art aura, enveloping himself in a protective shield and darting away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, all the attacks missed their mark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your Spatial Domain is indeed tricky. I'll just have to shatter it!" Scarlett sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raising her hand, she commanded all the vines to strike, battering Osborne's Spatial Domain with a thunderous roar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Osborne's Spatial Domain was incredibly close to Level Three, it still fell short. It could handle ordinary experts, but against Scarlett, it wasn't as solid as he had hoped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vines danced menacingly, and with just two synchronized strikes, they shattered Osborne's Spatial Domain into fragments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scarlett wore a smug smile. "Without your Spatial Domain, how do you plan to escape now? This is my world; I'm the deity here, and you're nothing more than my plaything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the vines surged and extended wildly, lashing out at Osborne with terrifying force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scoffed, no longer attempting to dodge. Without the spatial power, using interdimensional travel would drain his mental energy far too quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with the onslaught of countless vines barreling towards him, he made a bold decision&mdash;he would confront them head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne swung his fist forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His punch collided with the rushing vines, shattering them in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he did so, a tremendous force rushed back into him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Staggering back two steps, Osborne was surprised. For the first time at the Honor Quest Ceremony, he found himself at a disadvantage, actually being pushed back by sheer strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the broken vines didn't stay defeated for long. They quickly reformed, reshaping themselves into even more numerous and densely packed tendrils that lunged at him again, stronger than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination, Osborne punched once more, but the impact threw him back another two steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After seeing Osborne&rsquo;s setback, Scarlett's expression twisted with contempt and amusement.</span></p><div class="pagination">
