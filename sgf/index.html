  <div class="container"><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">&quot;Osborne, dump my foot bath water,&quot; commanded the woman sprawled on the couch - his mother-in-law, Evelyn Caldwell.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">Fresh from her soak, she lounged in a see-through nightgown. That silk gown hugged every curve like a second skin, turning her into a walking temptation.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">Her chest swelled with arrogance as she looked down at him like dirt.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">Osborne played the obedient servant, stepping forward like a whipped dog.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">He dared not complain. As the &quot;useless&quot; husband who had married into the family, he ranked lower than their family pet. His wife and her mother made sure he knew it every single day.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">As he reached for the basin, Evelyn&#x27;s small, delicate foot &quot;accidentally&quot; grazed his groin.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">Osborne froze. His eyes went wide as her foot pressed against him, tracing teasing circles.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">The room suddenly felt electric.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">&quot;You poor thing,&quot; Evelyn purred, her voice dripping with mockery. &quot;You&#x27;ve never even tasted a woman, have you? My daughter&#x27;s kept you locked up since the wedding, hasn&#x27;t she?&quot;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">&quot;Well, today... let me help you with that little problem.&quot;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">With that, Evelyn stood up and pressed her voluptuous body against his back, her hands wrapping around his dick.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">Osborne&#x27;s face burned with rage.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">&quot;Stop this, Evelyn! I don&#x27;t want it! What if Ophelia sees? She&#x27;ll misunderstand!&quot;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">Evelyn laughed, a cold, mocking sound. &quot;Misunderstand? Oh honey, you&#x27;ve got to watch this.&quot;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">She pulled out her phone and opened a video. Osborne&#x27;s world shattered as he watched his wife, buck naked, going wild with some guy against a floor-to-ceiling window.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">&quot;Ass up. Down on all fours like the bitch you are! That&#x27;s it.&quot;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">&quot;Oh, yeah... Harder! Faster... I&#x27;m close!&quot;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">&quot;You filthy slut, turn around and face the camera. Your hubby&#x27;s gonna love this! Let me send him later.&quot;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">&quot;No, don&#x27;t! He thinks I&#x27;m his perfect angel - too pure to touch me like this!&quot;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">&quot;Oh god, slow down a bit... I can&#x27;t take it!&quot;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">&quot;You&#x27;re so amazing, I&#x27;m coming! Ahhh...&quot;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">Osborne&#x27;s fists clenched in fury as he watched the video, his anger boiling over.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">&quot;You heartless whore! After everything I&#x27;ve done for you, and this is how you repay me?&quot; he barked.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">Then his eyes locked onto Evelyn&#x27;s ample chest. Before she could blink, he grabbed them roughly.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">Evelyn gasped in a mix of pain and twisted pleasure. &quot;Ah... Mmm!&quot;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">Without warning, he attacked her breasts like a wild beast, teeth sinking into her nipples as he tore her clothes to shreds.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><em><span style="font-size:12ptpx">You want to play dirty, Ophelia?</span></em></p><p class="MsoNormal"><em><span style="font-size:12ptpx">You think cheating hurts me?</span></em></p><p class="MsoNormal"><em><span style="font-size:12ptpx">Then watch me destroy your precious mommy!</span></em></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">He ripped off his clothes and drove into Evelyn hard, their bodies trembling with forbidden pleasure.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">He&#x27;d always known she was a widow, but damn - this woman was built for sin.</span> <span style="font-size:12ptpx">She was stunning, her beauty and allure intoxicating.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">Now, with her firm, voluptuous frame pressed against him, he was drunk on pure lust.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">Evelyn&#x27;s perfect body quivered under him, those incredible tits bouncing wildly with each forceful thrust.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">Skin slapping against skin filled the room like thunder.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">&quot;Don&#x27;t stop! So fucking</span> <span style="font-size:12ptpx">good! Yeah, harder! Give it to me!&quot;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">Just as they reached a boiling point, the door burst open.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">Ophelia stormed in with a dozen burly guards, face twisted in rage.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">&quot;What the fuck, Osborne? That&#x27;s my mother, you sick bastard! How dare you touch her!&quot; she screeched.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">Osborne froze, pulling away as reality crashed down on him.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">But before he could muster a word, Ophelia threw some papers in his face - divorce papers.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">&quot;Sign it and leave. Walk away with nothing. Now!&quot;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">Osborne&#x27;s eyes widened in disbelief. &quot;A divorce? With nothing?&quot;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">&quot;WHY?!&quot; he roared, his anger exploding.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">Ophelia&#x27;s face twisted with disgust as she shot him a piercing glare. &quot;Why? Because you fucked my mother, you piece of shit!&quot;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">&quot;Because I&#x27;m the true heir to the Caldwell fortune now. You&#x27;re just garbage to me.&quot;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">With a smirk, she watched her mother, Evelyn, collect her clothes and walk to her side. Then, both women shared a victorious look.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">Red mist clouded Osborne&#x27;s vision as pure, savage fury coursed through his body like molten steel.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">&quot;Oh, I get it now. Real cute setup you got here! Tell me, Ophelia - did you ever think about your husband while you were spreading your legs for other men?&quot; His voice dripped with venom.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">&quot;I&#x27;m done with this shit. Boys, take out the garbage!&quot; Ophelia&#x27;s voice cut like arctic ice.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">At her command, her pack of muscle-bound goons lunged at Osborne, fists flying wildly as they showered him with punches and kicks. One of them even whipped out a gun, slamming the pistol grip right into Osborne&#x27;s skull.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">Blood fountained as he crashed to the ground, painting the floor crimson.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">&quot;Enough!&quot; Ophelia&#x27;s voice dripped with satisfaction as she stalked toward Osborne&#x27;s broken body.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">Her stiletto dug into his chest as she looked down at him like roadkill.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">Disgust flickered in her eyes. &quot;So, you ready to sign those papers now?&quot;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">Osborne glared up at his wife, eyes blazing with pain and fury.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">&quot;Fine! You want it? Take it here, I&#x27;ll sign!&quot;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">Ophelia let out a laugh, then grabbed the papers and dropped them on the floor.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">Gritting his teeth, Osborne snatched the divorce papers and hastily scribbled his name across the blood-stained pages.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">&quot;Mark my words - you&#x27;ll both pay for this! I swear!&quot; he shouted, his voice full of rage as he stormed out of the Caldwell Tower.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">When he stumbled into some desolate street, something unexpected happened.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">A fleet of black luxury cars squealed to a stop around him. Doors flew open, and hundreds of men in suits and shades emerged.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">They lined up in perfect formation, bowing as one, respect etched on their faces.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12ptpx">&quot;Welcome, Mr. Augustine. The Godfather sends his regards. He wants to see you now.&quot;</span></p><div class="pagination">
