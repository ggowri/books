  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne watched the crowd scatter like spooked deer, a soft chuckle escaped his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was all thanks to Lincoln's astonishing might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His effortless victory over Lincoln had sent a crystal-clear message to everyone&mdash;if they couldn't hold a candle to Lincoln, there was no way they could take on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this arena, the slow-footed were easy pickings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One moment they were the hunter, and the next, they could end up being the hunted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waved off the fleeing competitors. Sure, they were all in the top thirty, each with a fair share of points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had no interest in giving chase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After downing Lincoln, he'd snagged a tenth of Lincoln's points&mdash;350 thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That bumped his total up to a whopping 7.95 million, enough to leapfrog Horace and land him the second spot on the leaderboard, just trailing behind Agatha, who'd broken the ten-million mark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered, plotting his next moves, "That oughta do the trick!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I can take out Benson, Broderick, Horace, and Agatha one after another in a flash, I'll push my score past 11 million! And when I beat Agatha, her points will take a nosedive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, I'll be taking home the championship!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at the leaderboard and noticed the white markers for Agatha and Horace were so close they were practically rubbing shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy suddenly spoke up, "Shame I won't be around to see that showdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the clash of the titans from the power rankings! It's gonna be the most epic battle of this state duel, no doubt about it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara shook her head. "Most intense? That's a stretch! Remember, Horace isn't in second place anymore. It's Osborne now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I reckon the real fireworks will be between Osborne and Agatha," she added, then turned to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's your take on it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne flashed a smile. "Maybe! But first things first, I gotta deal with Broderick and Benson. After getting trounced by Agatha, they're gunning for me. I can scare off the others, but those two? They're tough nuts to crack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I can't knock out Broderick and Benson, there's no way I can go toe-to-toe with Agatha."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes blazed with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, on the far side of the Arctic Maw Chasm, Agatha and Horace finally squared off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace's eyes were like lasers, and his whole demeanor was oozing with fighting spirit. "Agatha, you finally decided to show up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been itching for this fight for ages!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's find out who's the big cheese in this state duel! I'll take you down and prove to everyone in Zephyr State that I, Horace, am the real number one under the Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha let out a soft laugh. "You won't be beating me! Even if you did, it wouldn't make you the kingpin in Zephyr State."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Agatha's thoughts were once again invaded by the visage of Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace frowned and said, "Is that so? Maybe there are some dark-horse masters in Zephyr State, but I don't think they can hold a torch to us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In my book, if I beat you, I'll grab the title of the strongest under the Empyrean Sacredness. And if you beat me, I'll tip my hat to you as the best."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha gave a nonchalant shrug. "Suit yourself! You gonna make your move? Or you'll blow your shot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace let out a sneering laugh. "Agatha, you're way too full of yourself! Yeah, I know your Phoenix Cry Bone Flute packs a punch, but I'm no pushover. You think that flute can take me down? You're in for a rude awakening."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, Horace whipped out a strange Sacred Artifact&mdash;a gnarled wooden staff swathed in ragged cloth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It looked so shabby that it could've passed for a piece of junk, but no one in their right mind would underestimate it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the famous Frost-invoking Canvas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumor had it that in the city duel, Horace had unleashed the Frost-invoking Canvas with such brute force that it had frozen the entire arena solid in an instant. Even the high-ranking Empyrean Sacredness observers up on the podium were left gobsmacked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was one hell of a Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to the officials in the Zephyr State, it was on the same level as Agatha's Phoenix Cry Bone Flute, and miles ahead of the rest in its league.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was exactly why Agatha and Horace were at the top of the power rankings, holding the first and second spots respectively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Agatha, let's see if you can stand up to my Frost-invoking Canvas!" Horace declared, full of swagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha gave a faint smile. "The Frost-invoking Canvas, huh? It's a real beast, no doubt. A while back, it might've given me the jitters. But not anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She casually tucked her hands behind her back, oozing confidence. "Come on, take your best shot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha's main motivation for venturing down to the seventh layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm was to hunt for the Frost-kissed Heart. She aimed to soak up its powers to fend off Horace's freezing attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chilling energy unleashed by the Frost-invoking Canvas was rumored to be utterly destructive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mentor had warned her that even with the Phoenix Skeletal Shield, she'd probably end up as a mere ice sculpture. So, her best bet was to harness the energy of the Frost-kissed Heart and steel herself against the bone-numbing cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But things didn't go as she'd hoped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Agatha tried to absorb the power of the Heart, she got frozen solid in an instant and came dangerously close to kicking the bucket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, she'd only managed to absorb a tiny sliver of its energy. However, thanks to Osborne's influence, she unexpectedly unlocked the Dark Phoenix bloodline within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she hadn't fully kindled the Flames of the Dark Phoenix, she was now tough and confident enough to withstand run-of-the-mill ice powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmmph!" Horace sneered, sizing her up. "You really want me to make the first move? If we go at it simultaneously, even I can't guarantee a win. But if I strike first, you're toast! I'm not one to play dirty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha stayed as cool as a cucumber, her calmness unbroken. "Cut the blabbering and just attack already!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace's irritation flared up. "Fine! You've got it coming! But don't come whining to me if you lose!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Frost! Come!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a shout, Horace brandished the tattered Frost-invoking Canvas, unleashing a gush of bone-chilling might. The freezing force exploded around them like a furious tempest. Icy winds howled and swirled, and snowflakes fluttered down, each one carrying an alarming bite of cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He crowed triumphantly, "Freeze! Agatha, this is the end!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even a Flame Phoenix would be no match for my ice-cold power. You're done for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The never-ending blizzard of snowflakes whirled around Agatha, wrapping her in a thick layer of ice that formed in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace watched with a smug grin as the ice encased her, confident that victory was in the bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I've won!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No one below the Empyrean Sacredness can get out of my Frost-invoking Canvas unharmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Once frozen, it's all over. Even those who've just ascended to the Empyrean Sacredness can't pull through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Agatha, you've already bitten the dust!</span></p><div class="pagination">
