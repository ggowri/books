  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy's expression darkened as he processed the fact that Osborne had managed to block his attack. The two had fought to a standstill; although he hadn't used all his strength, he definitely hadn't held back either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was far from normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, everyone in Wild Flame City knew that Osborne had only recently broken through to Celestial Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A fledgling Celestial Deity standing up to a Deity Overlord head-on without losing ground?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was simply impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Throughout Celestara, there were no tales of such prodigies. Those who could defeat Deity Overlord warriors at the peak of Celestial Deity were considered super geniuses&mdash;extremely rare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Could a Celestial Deity in his early stages really contend with a Deity Overlord? Absolutely not!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As unease settled over him, Guy began to suspect that Osborne was using some sort of special technique to conceal his true power. Perhaps Osborne was also a Deity Overlord warrior, just like himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne chuckled. "Am I a Deity Overlord warrior? If that's what you want to believe, then sure, let's go with that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Osborne activated the Eclipsing Mantra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The five Divine Flames above his head began to shift and, in the blink of an eye, transformed into six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Six Divine Flames&mdash;now that signified the level of a Deity Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy's body jolted as realization hit him, and a knowing expression crept onto his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, you lowly creature from the Human Community, you've been hiding your true power! But I've seen through your ruse! Even if you are a Deity Overlord warrior, you're still going to die today. You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before he could finish, Guy's expression hardened dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stared, slack-jawed, at the six Divine Flames above Osborne's head as they suddenly morphed again&mdash;this time, into seven!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seven brilliant Divine Flames now blazed above Osborne, leaving Guy utterly stunned. Fear and dread flickered in his eyes, and his body trembled involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seven Divine Flames&mdash;this was the mark of a Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You... you're a Deity King?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy was speechless, and even the injured Bruno, witnessing the seven Divine Flames above Osborne, couldn't help but tremble in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled, a glint of mischief in his eyes. "Deity King? What if I told you I might be even stronger than a Deity King?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he activated the Eclipsing Mantra once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The seven dazzling Divine Flames above his head transformed into eight, then nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, they multiplied into a dazzling array, overwhelming in their brilliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy was left dumbfounded. His face darkened as he realized he had been played.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The number of Divine Flames above Osborne's head had nothing to do with his true level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could change the number of Divine Flames at will!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This revelation sent shockwaves through Guy's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What kind of trick is this? How can you change the number and color of your Divine Flames at will? What is your true level?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy's expression was grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled, "What's the point of telling you my secrets? But since you're so curious about my true level, I'll let you in on it. I'm actually at the early stage of Transcendent Deity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Osborne ceased using the Eclipsing Mantra, and the multitude of Divine Flames above his head vanished, leaving only four transparent Divine Flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy's face darkened further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Early stage of Transcendent Deity? Why don't you just say you're a Junior Deity? The fact that you could block my attack means you're at least at the peak of Celestial Deity if not a Deity Overlord!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stared at the four transparent Divine Flames above Osborne's head, convinced it was all a trick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, how could a Transcendent Deity possess such strength?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the transparent Divine Flames represented a Waste Divine Body, a state devoid of rank or power. With Osborne's strength, how could he possibly be a Transcendent Deity with a Waste Divine Body?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shrugged at Guy's disbelief. "If you can't take my word for it, what can I do? If you think I'm a Deity Overlord, then I'm a Deity Overlord. If you think I'm a Celestial Deity, then that's what I am!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, five azure Divine Flames reappeared above Osborne's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His demeanor shifted, turning cold and resolute. "I'm done wasting time talking to you. I've already spent too long here. Even though you picked a nice, safe spot where no one would bother us, it's best to deal with you quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Osborne took a step closer to Guy, the latter's anger flared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Deal with us? You think you can just waltz in and take us down? Don't get cocky just because you blocked one of my attacks! I was only using about sixty percent of my power back there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne chuckled. "You were using sixty percent? Funny, I was only at fifty! It seems that with my Thunder Power, I'm just a notch stronger than you. To deal with you, it won't be a walk in the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright then, let me show you what I can really do!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that declaration, the crackling lightning that surrounded Osborne vanished in an instant, replaced by a more formidable and domineering black energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was dark power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's dark elemental essence had recently reached the late stage of Level Six, making it significantly stronger than the early stage of his Thunder Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This dark power was far more potent than the Thunder Power he had just demonstrated!</span></p><div class="pagination">
