  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the second stage, the test simulated a sudden ambush to see how well they could safely protect the employer and escape.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Armed with just a riot shield and a dummy as the employer, they faced over a dozen fake guns firing from several hundred yards away in two directions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This stage was extremely tough. The riot shield couldn&rsquo;t fully cover both the participant and the dummy. They had to minimize harm to the dummy, even if it meant using their own body as a shield.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The best bodyguard in this challenge let the dummy get hit only five times, which was impressive. He used the shield and non-lethal parts of his body to block over ninety-five percent of the bullets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, for Osborne, this test was straightforward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Osborne activated Satan&rsquo;s Eye, everything turned into slow motion, including bullets fired several hundred yards away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He could even calculate the bullet&rsquo;s trajectory and final landing point, effortlessly choosing to dodge or block with the riot shield.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">So, as he crossed the assessment area with the dummy, not only was the dummy untouched by the simulated bullets, but Osborne himself was never hit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the second assessment, Osborne once again secured the absolute first place, widening the gap further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Such a performance not only stunned Wesley and Ophelia on the high platform but also left the other competitors at the shooting range utterly flabbergasted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They even suspected that the Radcliffe family was helping Osborne cheat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Otherwise, it couldn&rsquo;t be explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But only Donna knew that in this assessment, she didn&rsquo;t assist Osborne in cheating. In fact, she specifically instructed the assessors to increase difficulty for Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Yet, Osborne still passed flawlessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;How is this possible?&rdquo; Donna murmured, amazed that Osborne managed to block the dense barrage of bullets with the riot shield, a truly miraculous feat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She suddenly looked at a middle-aged man behind Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Captain Paul, under the same circumstances, could you achieve this level of performance?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At the mention of Paul, the middle-aged man&rsquo;s mouth twitched slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ms. Donna Radcliffe, I should be able to, with a bit of luck.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Does that mean you can&rsquo;t do it?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna didn&rsquo;t voice this thought, furrowing her brow, lost in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Of the three assessments, the one she valued the most was the second stage because this stage tested whether the bodyguard could safely evacuate Clarissa unharmed in case of an attack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She needed a bodyguard who could shield Clarissa from bullets at critical moments.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">So, when Osborne took a significant lead in the first stage, Donna remained calm, knowing that while Osborne&rsquo;s marksmanship was impressive, Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard team had skilled marksmen as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But when Osborne flawlessly passed the second stage, Donna was moved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard team lacked talents like him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna thought to herself, glancing at Clarissa, <span style="font-style: italic;">If this guy hadn&rsquo;t unrealistic dreams about Clarissa, that&rsquo;d be great. Based on his performance, I&rsquo;ve got to keep him, no matter what.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She asked, &ldquo;Clarissa, what do you think of Osborne&rsquo;s performance?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa remained cold-faced, seemingly unaffected by Osborne&rsquo;s flawless display. Her eyes kept scanning over each bodyguard, not lingering on Osborne deliberately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This behavior reassured Donna a bit more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Not bad. Leading in both stages shows his strength. However, I still believe Captain Paul is stronger, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna chuckled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She didn&rsquo;t say much but continued, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s move on to the third assessment. It&rsquo;s a combat test, a brawl with ten participants. It won&rsquo;t be easy for him to stand out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Especially after his outstanding performance in the first two phases, he&rsquo;s become everyone&rsquo;s target. After all, he&rsquo;s not from any security company; he just jumped into the fray.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Those company folks, to save themselves from embarrassment, will probably team up against him.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Deep within Clarissa&rsquo;s eyes, a sudden worry surfaced, though she hid it well, escaping Donna&rsquo;s notice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She feigned indifference, saying, &ldquo;Alliance is within the rules. He&rsquo;ll have to deal with on his own.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna was right; Osborne had indeed become a marked man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The other hundred participants hailed from the top ten security firms, all clad in standardized uniforms adorned with their respective company logos. Only Osborne stood out in his athletic gear, clearly out of place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Moreover, Osborne had joined the assessment unexpectedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s flawless performance in the first two phases had practically secured him one spot, leaving only four for the rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With one less spot available, they naturally felt disgruntled. Even if it was just for their pride, they all wanted to teach Osborne a lesson in the third phase.</p><div class="pagination">
