  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zorro acted as the referee on the stage, and he saw everything most clearly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was through his words that everyone understood the situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It turned out that Osborne's arrow had already defeated Seraphina, but he didn&rsquo;t spare her. Instead, he instantly used spatial power to appear beside Seraphina and launched a close-range attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zorro noticed something was wrong and immediately stepped in to stop it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, it was too late.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne endured an attack from Zorro, quickly inflicted severe injuries on Seraphina, leaving massive wounds on her face and chest, and finally neatly severed both of her legs.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hiss!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone gasped sharply after figuring out the situation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne is way too bold.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Is he really not afraid of death?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In front of almost all the Royal Family members, defeating Seraphina wasn&rsquo;t enough for Osborne&mdash;he had to injure her so badly?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How dare he!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, in the Royal Family members' area, everyone was glaring angrily at Osborne, filled with murderous intent, wishing they could go down and kill Osborne immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in the end, they didn&rsquo;t do that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because today is the Glorious Sacrificial Ceremony, and what&rsquo;s happening now is the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel. At this moment, countless trillions of people across various cities in the Glorious Divine Kingdom are watching this Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel through projections.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne defeated and injured Seraphina in the ring with his own strength. If they took action against Osborne, there would be no way to justify it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Others would only think that the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom cannot tolerate ordinary people being stronger than its members, jealous of talent. By then, who would still want to stay in the Glorious Divine Kingdom?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, although the Royal Family members were furious, they could only coldly watch Osborne, with no one taking action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clutched his chest and stood up, a smile on his lips.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He certainly knew that the Royal Family wouldn&rsquo;t take action against him because of this, at least not in public. The Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom couldn&rsquo;t afford to lose such face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stared at Zorro, a hint of killing intent flashing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just now, Zorro had truly gone all out to stop him from seriously injuring Seraphina. Zorro was an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection. If Osborne hadn&rsquo;t reacted quickly enough to avoid a critical hit, he himself might have been seriously injured by now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After that, there&rsquo;s no way to continue participating in the top five ranking battle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This Zorro did it on purpose!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said coldly, "You say I went too hard? I don&rsquo;t think this counts as going too hard! Before I fought her, she personally said she would seriously injure me, break my legs, and stop me from participating in the upcoming top five ranking battle."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone heard it... In that case, is it considered going too hard if I dealt with her equally? But you... as a referee, you could have stopped me, yet you went all out against me, trying to seriously injure me. I wonder why?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, a cold glint flashed in Zorro's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You&rsquo;re still making excuses?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As a referee, it's my duty to ensure the safety of the contestants! When a contestant's life is in danger, I naturally have to step in to stop it! I already told you to stop, but you still wouldn't listen and wanted to kill your opponent! Of course, I had no choice but to take action to forcibly stop you from killing your opponent!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Zorro finished speaking, his face was full of righteous determination, showing an expression that he had done nothing wrong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile, "Alright, alright! Say whatever you want! Anyway, I didn&rsquo;t hear you telling me to stop... In the heat of battle, I was too focused to hear anything from the outside!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As for why I hit so hard... that's because my opponent is too strong! I had injured her before, but everyone saw it&mdash;she was still holding back her strength and had hidden cards to play!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So this time, I didn&rsquo;t want to cause trouble for myself. Naturally, I had to completely defeat her, leaving her no ability to fight back to feel at ease."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Otherwise, what if I stop and she gets back up to attack me again?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne shrugged.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Anyway, I didn&rsquo;t break the rules! The Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel never said you can&rsquo;t severely injure your opponent, right? So now that she&rsquo;s unconscious and has passed out, can you announce my victory?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As for you injuring me earlier, I won&rsquo;t bother holding it against you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, Zorro was instantly furious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He realized that he truly had no way to punish Osborne for this, as Osborne indeed didn&rsquo;t break any rules, and there was no rule against severely injuring an opponent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne won!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Seraphina lost!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zorro couldn&rsquo;t do anything about Osborne and could only look up at Callista on the high platform, clearly unable to make a decision on his own and needing Callista&rsquo;s instructions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista's face looked extremely unpleasant at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She stared at the unconscious Seraphina, her eyes filled with anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Useless trash! You confidently told me before that no one below Empyrean Sacredness was your match, that you would surely defeat Osborne, severely injure him, and help Princess Rosalie secure second place...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And yet, you ended up being severely injured by Osborne!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Callista was furious, but she also knew nothing could be changed. Seraphina had already lost, and Osborne had defeated her fair and square in the arena, leaving no room for argument.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if Osborne hit hard, it didn't break the rules.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Zorro doesn't announce Osborne's victory soon, it will only invite criticism and controversy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Callista could only nod at Zorro.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Zorro finally spoke reluctantly, "The first match of the top five ranking battle, Seraphina versus Osborne, Osborne... wins!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he cast a cold glance at Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obviously, he held a grudge against Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled, sensing Zorro's hostility but not caring at all, and slowly walked off the stage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He won!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And with Seraphina severely injured by him, she couldn't continue to compete and could only rank last, while Rosalie posed no threat to him at all!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, his plan will be executed perfectly!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He will take Clara and Leroy, dominating the top three of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, keeping all nine Royal Family princes and princesses out of the top three.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Royal Family's reputation is completely ruined!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, watched by billions, the Royal Family's princes and princesses were trampled under his feet, becoming his stepping stones.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And he will become the number one in the entire Glorious Divine Kingdom, beneath Empyrean Sacredness!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's lips curled into a smile as he looked toward the Royal Family members. He could feel that many of them were glaring at him with anger and murderous intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially Seraphina's brother...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hendrix's eyes were blood-red, wishing he could tear Osborne apart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne just curled his lips, not caring at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought to himself, "Hendrix! In my previous life, you broke one of my legs! And now, I&rsquo;ve cut off your sister&rsquo;s legs! But that&rsquo;s not enough... Next, it&rsquo;s your turn! Next time, I&rsquo;ll personally break your legs for revenge!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne finished thinking, he closed his eyes, ignoring the outside noise and chatter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, the top five ranking battle continued.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The second match was Clara versus Leroy, and Leroy chose to forfeit directly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The third match was Rosalie versus Osborne...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stepped up again and defeated Rosalie with a single arrow, injuring her as well...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fourth match...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fifth match...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after, all the matches for the top five rankings finally concluded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone stared in shock at Osborne, Clara, and Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They can play like this?!</span></p><div class="pagination">
