  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bidding for the three Celestial Deity-level female slaves had skyrocketed to 50 million Essence Crystals, leaving everyone in the room utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fifty million!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For those powerful factions, that was a staggering amount of wealth&mdash;enough to cover a year's expenses if they played their cards right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, all of this was for three untrained human slaves!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's this guy thinking? He must have stumbled upon some ancient deity's treasure trove! There's no way someone of his status could have that many Essence Crystals otherwise!" one onlooker whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at him, tossing around money like it's nothing. Those Crystals must have come to him by chance; he clearly doesn't know their worth," another added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But just how many Essence Crystals does he actually have? If it's a lot, we might just have to consider taking him down a peg."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good luck with that! He's really riled up Fabian. The moment he steps out of this auction house, I wouldn't be surprised if Fabian goes after him without a second thought!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such a waste..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd murmured among themselves, eyes darting between Osborne and Fabian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian, indeed, was fuming. With the price now at 50 million, even he felt the sting. As much as he desired those three slaves, this price was pushing his limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" he growled, raising his paddle again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go for 51 million! If you raise the bid again, those three slaves are yours!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he shot a menacing glare at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian knew full well that threats meant little to someone like Osborne, who seemed oblivious to the danger he was in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, unperturbed, smiled, "Oh? Is that so?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In that case, I'll save a bit. I'll bid 52 million! After all, my Essence Crystals are running low, and I need to be frugal! You, as a Deity Overlord warrior, wouldn't go back on your word, would you? You'll keep bidding, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne finished, Fabian shot up from his seat, fury radiating from him like a storm. His divine power surged, threatening to erupt at any moment, as if he could obliterate Osborne into a puddle of flesh with a single strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd recoiled in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Osborne remained calm, his expression betraying no hint of fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, however, he was tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was fully aware that while Fabian wouldn't dare act here, he couldn't afford to let his guard down. He was prepared; if things escalated, he would unleash his spatial power and make a swift exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!" Fabian managed to rein in his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, alright! You pathetic human scum, I'll remember you! You'd better not leave this place, or I swear I'll turn you into a pile of mush!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be waiting for you outside!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before you step out, make sure to clean your neck!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those chilling words, Fabian stormed out, his face a mask of fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had given up on the auction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only thing that had piqued his interest was those three Celestial Deity-level human slaves, and now that he had lost the bid, there was no point in sticking around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Remaining here would only mean watching Osborne gloat while he was powerless to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian had made a vow: as soon as Osborne stepped out of the slave market, he would strike and crush him on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! A lowly human thinks he can stand against me? Once I take you down, those slaves you bought will belong to me too! And that ancient deity's treasure you've got? All those Essence Crystals will be mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Fabian stormed out of the auction hall, he vanished from everyone's sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A collective sigh of relief swept through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he was the only Deity Overlord warrior present, casting a long shadow over the proceedings. With him gone, the atmosphere lightened considerably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't help but cast mocking glances at Osborne, their eyes filled with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Going once at 52 million! Is there anyone else keen to place a bid? Going twice at 52 million... Sold!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, the three Celestial Deity level female slaves fetching an eye-popping price of 52 million Essence Crystals were officially his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Tiana Hart, what's my total spending so far? How much more do I need to shell out to become a Super VIP here at the slave market?" Osborne asked Tiana, his tone as calm as ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tiana replied promptly, her voice smooth and professional, "Mr. Lachlan Swift, you've spent a total of 85 million Essence Crystals so far. According to our regulations, you only need to spend another 15 million to achieve Super VIP status and earn our special badge, which will ensure your protection within the slave market."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So just 15 million more, huh? That's not too bad. But I have to ask&mdash;if I become a Super VIP and Fabian decides he still wants to kill me, will the slave market step in to protect me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tiana hesitated for a moment, caught off guard by the question. Then she responded earnestly, "Of course we will protect you, but..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
