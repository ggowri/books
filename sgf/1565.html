  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bruno took his orders with a nod, saying, "Of course! I'll make sure Osborne's wishes are fulfilled!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But as soon as he turned away, a sneer crept across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Osborne really doesn't know what he's getting into! Picking a crew of washed-up veterans and the so-called geniuses sent over by various factions? Even I wouldn't dare provoke these guys!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now that Osborne has recruited them, he's asking for trouble. Because, as my centurion, his recruiting these people essentially means he's handing them over to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What a headache! But then again, the more trouble he runs into, the easier it'll be for me to swoop in and save the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That'll tighten our bond! And when the opportunity arises, I can execute my plan without a hitch. After dealing with Osborne, I could easily find a reason to send these folks back where they came from!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that final thought, Bruno's mood brightened considerably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, Bruno had summoned everyone from Osborne's list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When these individuals learned that Osborne himself had requested them to join his elite team of a hundred, they were momentarily stunned, but it didn't take long for them to break into mocking smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They quickly divided themselves into two distinct factions. One group comprised the washed-up veterans, those long beaten down by the system. No matter how skilled or accomplished they were, they hadn't been given a chance to rise through the ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some had even reached the Celestial Deity level, only to be demoted to squad leader or, in some cases, just regular members after being falsely accused of mistakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had long since given up on promotions, resigned to their fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But that didn't mean they were without spirit. Their bitterness was directed at those with status and connections, as these were the ones who had kept them trapped beneath their thumbs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The veterans and the new talents sent from the various factions formed two opposing sides, simmering with tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They held mutual disdain for each other while sharing a single, common target&mdash;Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For the veterans, it was clear that Osborne's rise to centurion was due to his connections. He was clearly someone Guy had chosen to groom for greater things, and they couldn't help but resent it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why should they fight tooth and nail for recognition while Osborne waltzed into the Wild Flame Army and immediately garnered Guy's favor?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What gave him the right to command them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The geniuses from various factions had it even worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They whispered among themselves, "Osborne? Just a lowly Human Community member trying to recruit us? He thinks he can order us around?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What gives him the nerve? Just because he has Spark of Blaze behind him doesn't mean he gets to act high and mighty!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We're just not interested in taking him down&mdash;yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's show him who's boss when we get the chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they gathered in hushed conversation, Bruno couldn't help but smile coldly at their murmurs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bruno could already envision Osborne's bafflement when faced with this band of disgruntled "elites"&mdash;flustered and embarrassed, completely out of his depth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, follow me! I'll take you to meet your commander!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Bruno led the group of 110 directly to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, I've brought you everyone you asked for. I have some other matters to attend to, so I'll leave you to it. If you need anything, just call for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without waiting for a response, Bruno hurried away, clearly eager to escape the brewing tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The 110 soldiers turned their gazes toward Osborne, their expressions a mix of icy contempt, anger, and arrogance. None of them offered even a hint of respect. They didn't seem like a group ready to be led by a commander.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, however, merely smiled faintly, unfazed by the hostility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had anticipated this reaction. He mused, "Let them flaunt their arrogance for now. Soon enough, they'll all be reshaped into my descendants of the Blood Clan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, "Hello, everyone. I'm Osborne Augustine from the Human Community. You're all my carefully selected elite&mdash;powerful and talented individuals, the cream of the crop from the tens of thousands in the battalion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But I'm a firm believer in seeing things firsthand. Although I've read your files, I haven't gotten to experience your abilities in action yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm quite particular about my team; I don't tolerate deadweight. So, I don't know who among you might be a liability, but I have a strong feeling there's at least a few of you in the mix."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With those words, Osborne's eyes swept over the crowd, giving off an unmistakable air of challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Predictably, his comments ignited fury among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One grizzled veteran snapped, stepping forward, his fists clenched, "Who are you calling deadweight, you little punk? You think you can question us old-timers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who does that lowly human think he is, calling us useless?" another barked, his features twisted in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're asking for a world of hurt!" someone else added, the threat heavy in the air.</span></p><div class="pagination">
