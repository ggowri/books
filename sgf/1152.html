  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne gazed at the dozen or so Class S Dark Exotic Beasts, he was utterly astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was his first encounter with Class S Dark Exotic Beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the heart of the Lostridge Mountains, amidst a tide of over 500 thousand Ferocious Beasts, there had been more than 50 thousand Dark Exotic Beasts, none of which were Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At most, they were Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here, he was confronted with several Class S Dark Exotic Beasts all at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it was clear that this was just the tip of the iceberg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, his expression growing serious, "This sudden fissure is definitely suspicious. We need to get to the bottom of this. It's crucial that we eliminate every last Dark Exotic Beast in the fissure. If these Class S beasts escape and spread out across Rosmandi, gathering the Ferocious Beasts and triggering a massive Beast Tide, it'll be a nightmare to deal with!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His interest in the fissure intensified, but the sight of so many Class S beasts made him more vigilant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He watched as the thousands of Class A and above fighters from Eidolon City struggled against the few Class S Dark Exotic Beasts. Osborne wasn't rushing in to help, noting how disorganized they were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logically, with over a thousand Class A warriors attacking just a handful of Class S Dark Exotic Beasts, they shouldn't be having such a tough time. If it were the Blood Demon members, they would've wiped out those Class S beasts in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Eidolon City fighters clearly lacked coordination. Most of them were freshly promoted Class A fighters with little combat experience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with the onslaught of the Dark Exotic Beasts, many of them showed signs of fear and hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, shaking his head, "In a situation like this, their true strength isn't being displayed. If they can't take down even one Class S beast after all this time, and with casualties mounting, it's a chaotic mess."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned, muttering to himself, "Gaining power too quickly isn't always a blessing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These newly promoted Class A warriors wouldn't stand a chance against seasoned Class A warriors; three of them wouldn't be able to take down one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, they finally approached the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A middle-aged man stepped forward, and upon seeing him, Cillian and the others exclaimed in delight, "Dad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dave Carey looked a bit disheveled; he had just been in the thick of battle and bore some injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He regarded the four of them with a furrowed brow. "Cillian, didn't I send you to Newport City to seek help from the Augustine family? Why are you back so soon? Where's the backup?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he glanced over the shoulders of the four, searching for reinforcements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, meanwhile, had concealed his own aura, but the one hundred members of Blood Demon behind him radiated a power roughly equivalent to Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dave's eyes lit up at the sight of the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hundred Class AAA fighters were no small force, but they needed Class S support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression fell again as he realized the shortfall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cillian, is this the backup you found in Newport City? Did you explain the situation clearly? Did the Augustine family refuse to send any top-tier fighters? We desperately need Class S warriors right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cillian hurriedly replied, "Dad, it's not like that at all. This is..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dave sighed, interrupting Cillian abruptly, "Alright! Having reinforcements is better than none at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The situation is dire; we don't have time for much talk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everybody, please follow me and obey my commands. We'll strike together! Once we've dealt with these dozen Class S Dark Exotic Beasts, we'll treat you all properly and express our gratitude."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Dave gazed towards the battle scene, his face etched with gravity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Cillian grew agitated, thinking, "My father is actually ordering 'The Godfather' around?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His scalp tingled at the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Father, this is..." He tried to explain Osborne's identity, but at that moment, the dozen Class S Dark Exotic Beasts in the battle suddenly emitted piercing shrieks. Instantly, hundreds of Eidolon City elites plummeted like rain from the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dozen beasts flapped their razor-edged wings and launched themselves at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh no!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dave's face paled because many fallen were warriors of the Carey family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't afford to listen to Cillian's explanations and dashed forward immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop those damn creatures! Rescue them!" Dave bellowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, swiftly turning his head, he urgently shouted to Cillian and Osborne, "Follow me quickly, everyone! Hit their white spots on the belly; it's the only place not covered with scales&mdash;their sole weakness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After giving the order, Dave didn't wait for a response and hurled himself into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but rub his nose, thinking, "Is Dave actually ordering me around?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The head of a wealthy family, just Class AAA, ordering me, the Godfather of Rosmandi?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt both amused and befuddled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he said nothing, merely waved his hand and said, "Let's take care of them first."</span></p><div class="pagination">
