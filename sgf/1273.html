  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Sebastian was engulfed in despair. The sheer strength of the Deschanel Clan was overwhelming. They had barely survived the attack from Joseph and the other four Superior Deities; if not for the intervention of God of Star, they would have all been dead by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the God of Star taking out Joseph and the others, the Deschanel Clan remained a formidable force, now throwing three Transcendent Deities and a dozen Superior Deities into the mix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear they had no intention of letting anyone from the Augustine family escape alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even God of Star's expression shifted to one of alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon erupted in laughter. "To get your precious secrets, the Deschanel Clan has mobilized nearly half of our entire force!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you still dare to hold onto any hope?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Surrender now! If you hand over your secrets, I promise you won't die. After all, each of you possesses a Level Three Divine Body, a true marvel in the Age of Gods!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you dedicate yourselves to the Deschanel Clan, not only will we spare your lives, but we'll also nurture your talents and provide opportunities for further growth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon's gaze locked onto Sebastian as he continued, "So, are you still planning to resist? Your choice determines the fate of tens of thousands of the Augustine family. Do you really want to stubbornly lead them all to their deaths because of your misguided pride?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Eamon's words, the rest of the Augustine family turned their eyes toward Sebastian, clearly waiting for his response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fury blazed in Sebastian's eyes. "Just surrender and contribute to your clan? You won't just spare our lives but will even groom us? Bullshit!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you expect us to surrender and serve the Deschanel Clan? You want us to accept being your dogs, your slaves? To be used and trampled on, lacking any dignity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! You've got it all wrong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Augustine family would rather die standing than live on our knees! Even if you kill every last one of us, we will never bow to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His declaration rang with conviction and pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon's face twisted with fury. "You're asking for it! Do you really think I won't kill you? I'm going to take you down right now, hang your body at the entrance of the Augustine Estate, and see if the rest of your clan can muster the same courage you have!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a murderous intent filled Eamon's gaze as he charged toward Sebastian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch out!" God of Star cried out, springing into action to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop her!" Eamon shot back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other two Transcendent Deity warriors from the Deschanel Clan immediately dashed to block the God of Star from reaching him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Star unleashed her full power, but the pair worked in perfect tandem, stalling her advance. She couldn't break through their defenses, nor could she save Sebastian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon closed the distance between himself and Sebastian in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking down from his higher vantage point, he fixed his piercing glare on Sebastian. A suffocating pressure enveloped Sebastian, attempting to force him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Sebastian stood tall, defiance radiating from him as he met Eamon's fierce gaze head-on. There was no trace of fear in Sebastian's eyes; instead, a fierce glint shone within them that made Eamon hesitate for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon seethed with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, Sebastian was nothing more than an insignificant insect meant to cower and plead for mercy, to grovel before him like a dog seeking scraps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But here was Sebastian, unyielding, staring back with an intensity that made Eamon uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he was facing someone of greater importance, someone who dared to challenge his authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian once stood as the Godfather of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>. He was the most powerful, influential, and wealthiest figure in the underworld.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To many, he was the true embodiment of authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Eamon possessed greater strength, he was merely a mid-tier player within the Deschanel Clan. He had never held the reins of leadership, so how could he possibly hope to intimidate someone like Sebastian?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustrated by his inability to break Sebastian's will, Eamon felt his fury reach a boiling point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You deserve to die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you seek your own doom, let me grant you that wish! I promised to display your corpse at the entrance of the Augustine Estate. Let's see if anyone from your clan shares your stubbornness, your apparent disregard for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Eamon lunged, his hand slicing through the air towards Sebastian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The movement wasn't rushed; it felt almost methodical, as if Eamon wanted Sebastian to fully absorb the terror of his impending demise. Eamon hoped Sebastian would have the sense to beg for mercy at the last moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Sebastian did not waver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he was faced with Eamon's imminent attack, fear was the last thing on his mind. Sebastian gripped the Godfather's scepter and prepared to retaliate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Empowered by the scepter, his strike carried the weight and strength of a Superior Deity&mdash;yet to Eamon, it was a mere fly buzzing in his ear, a feeble attempt that only fueled his rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eamon's speed ramped up instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!" he bellowed, his arm coming down with lethal intent aimed directly at Sebastian's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when it seemed that Sebastian was about to be crushed under the force of Eamon's attack, an unexpected twist occurred.</span></p><div class="pagination">
