  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fight surrounding Anastasia, Zoe, and their five companions against Icy Seven and Icy Eight was </span><span>drawing to an end</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the immense pressure exerted by Osborne's absolute forbidden zone, both foes found their cultivation levels suppressed to Ascension Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they were certainly more powerful than the average Ascension Three&mdash;and could even hold their own against many Ascension Four opponents&mdash;their foes were not to be underestimated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the seven members of their group were all only at Ascension One, their actual combat capabilities matched </span><span>those of </span><span>most Ascension Threes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, the synergy in their coordination and strategies far exceeded that of typical </span><span>Ascension</span><span> Three fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were also unafraid of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, if any of them fell, Osborne could bring them back, allowing them to abandon all considerations </span><span>about defenses </span><span>and launch relentless assaults without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adding to their advantage was Hannah, the adept of life power among them, who could quickly heal any wounds they sustained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given these circumstances, Icy Seven and Icy Eight were immediately cast into a defensive position from the get-go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their level diminished, their defenses </span><span>might not be as powerful as those of </span><span>Icy Six, creating a considerable gap between their protective capabilities. Anastasia, Zoe, and the others unleashed a torrent of attacks that easily broke through their defenses and struck with devastating precision from all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tempest Jinx!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Age of Light!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Soul Ferrying!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Incendio!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The powerful Divine Ascendance Techniques of the seven erupted in a wild frenzy, smothering Icy Seven and Icy Eight. Though the duo fought valiantly, their vitality waned under the onslaught of relentless attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were on the edge of collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only thought carrying them forward was the desperate hope that Icy Six would swiftly dispatch Osborne and come to their rescue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But fate had other plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they gazed helplessly, they witnessed Icy Six's defenses shatter, his Divine Body obliterated, and his very soul denied the chance for escape or reincarnation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That realization shattered their hopes completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sickening crunch, Anastasia's devastating lightning bolt pierced their defenses, and the flood of attacks overwhelmed them, snuffing out their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You will die in misery!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll be waiting for you in hell!" they shouted defiantly just before their demise, their souls bursting forth from their Soul Current Ocean, racing to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not so fast!" Zoe scoffed, launching an attack that obliterated both fleeing souls with a flick of her wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, an eerie silence fell over the battlefield. Icy Six, Icy Seven, and Icy Eight&mdash;the three Dark Sovereigns loyal to Lord Malevolence&mdash;had all perished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, Zoe, and the others were left gasping for breath, exhaustion creeping in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But alongside their fatigue came an unparalleled thrill, knowing they had managed to take down two warriors whose real power was akin to Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you believe it? We took down Icy Seven and Icy Eight!" Zoe exclaimed, her eyes sparkling with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the God of Light had struggled to defeat them in battle multiple times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, we did it!" Anastasia beamed, wrapping her arms around Osborne's, beaming with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, a proud smile on his face as he gently ruffled her hair. "You all did fantastic!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally, you're starting to grow into your potential! Just a little more, and you'll be up there </span><span>in</span><span> the Celestara&mdash;top-tier super warriors!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their hearts swelled with joy at Osborne's encouragement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, we still have a long way to go compared to you! You single-handedly took down Icy Six, who was still packing the power of an Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings even after being suppressed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We were so worried about you, thinking we'd finish off our opponents and rush to help, but you wrapped things up before we even got the chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're incredible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group gazed at Osborne with awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had teamed up to defeat two Ascension Three Supernal Deity Kings, while he had single-handedly taken down one of Ascension Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap between Ascension Three and Ascension Five was like night and day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they reflected on this, a wave of frustration washed over them. No matter how hard they pushed themselves or how much time they spent training&mdash;often more than Osborne&mdash;it felt like the distance between them only grew wider.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that they lacked talent or effort; it was simply that Osborne was on another level altogether.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder the Eight Dark Sovereigns had gone to such extremes to eliminate him. If they were in their shoes, they'd be losing sleep over him too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately for them, they had underestimated Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Icy Six, Icy Seven, and Icy Eight were all dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what's our next move?" Anastasia asked, her curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne offered a faint smile, his eyes glinting with determination. "Of course, we keep killing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, the Eight Dark Sovereigns came at us with everything they had, bringing along a thousand Supernal Deity Kings! Taking down Icy Six, Icy Seven, and Icy Eight isn't enough&mdash;not by a long shot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need to make them feel </span><span>the </span><span>real pain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But first, we're going to put on a little show to flush out the traitors in the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here's the plan..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly laid out his strategy, and the others nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with a flick of his wrist, Osborne activated three Spatial Clones, their faces shifting and morphing into the likenesses of Icy Six, Icy Seven, and Icy Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using the Eclipsing Mantra, he altered their auras as well, nodding in satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne burst out of the Eclipse Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, fierce battles raged on in two directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On one side, the God of Light faced off against Icy One, Icy Two, Icy Three, Icy Four, and Icy Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other, a thousand Supernal Deity Kings under Lord Malevolence clashed with a thousand Supernal Deity Kings from the Hudson family, the Jackson family, the HeartUnited Alliance, and the Sanctum of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intensity of their fights was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light held the upper hand. Though she was only an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King like Icy One. Her strength far surpassed his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One was completely on the defensive, even with the support of four Ascension Six Supernal Deity Kings, struggling just to hold his ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One had anticipated this scenario and remained unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at the God of Light with a cold smile. "You're wasting your energy, God of Light! You know you can't defeat us or kill us! We've fought many times, and you've never managed to get the upper hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time, we're only after the Seven Young Deity Kings of the Human Community. They're probably dead by now, taken out by Icy Six, Icy Seven, and Icy Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll be leaving shortly, so save your strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light snorted in response, "Icy One, you're digging your own grave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she cast a worried glance toward the distant Eclipse Realm, her expression serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Eclipse Realm cut her off from sight and perception, leaving both her and Icy One unaware of the events unfolding inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her concern for Osborne and the others grew heavier by the second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a group of bloodied figures burst forth from the Eclipse Realm, looking battered and exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Osborne and his companions!</span></p><div class="pagination">
