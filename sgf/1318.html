  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Osborne's mind, two names flashed&mdash;League of Divine Descent and Eityreia Organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He muttered, a fierce glint sparking in his eyes, "Or perhaps they should be called the Pantheon League!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's high time to eliminate both the Pantheon League and the Eityreia Organization. But before I do that, I must first complete the fourth stage of my fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to achieve true immortality!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne didn't rush to exit his seclusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The integration with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was fraught with challenges and dangers. Even Cain, back in the day, had taken more than centuries, waiting until he reached Celestial Deity and achieved a Level Five Divine Body before he dared undertake that fusion, nearly losing his life in the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Osborne, it wouldn't be too daunting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Divine Body had become extraordinarily powerful following this transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After his metamorphosis, Osborne's Divine Body had easily reached the equivalent of a Level Eight Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the level of a Divine Body didn't always indicate absolute strength&mdash;it was crucial to consider one's overall realm as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For instance, with Osborne being merely a Superior Deity, his Level Eight Divine Body would, at most, match a Level Seven Divine Body of a Transcendent Deity or a Level Six from a Celestial Deity, comparable to a Level Five Divine Body from a Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, Osborne's Level Eight Divine Body greatly surpassed Cain's Level Five Divine Body when he was a Celestial Deity, which meant that fusing with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity wouldn't pose significant issues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Osborne had the Breath of Celestial on his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This element would significantly reduce both the frequency and the intensity of the vibrations during the fusion process, thereby minimizing the risks involved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he expected everything to flow smoothly during this particular fusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this time, the fusion would affect the Soul Current Ocean, so Osborne was careful not to rush it. Any damage to the soul would be a serious problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, he took his time, spending a full half-month to finally anchor the roots of the Lotus within his Soul Current Ocean, safeguarding his soul in the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At last, the fourth stage of the fusion was complete!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne truly acquired immortality. Even if his Divine Body were shattered or his soul extinguished, the power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity would allow him to resurrect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bestowed chance for rebirth had significantly increased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he opened his eyes, Osborne's Ethereal Glow was brighter than ever before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally done! Now, I can truly say I'm safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this month of seclusion, my dark and spatial elemental essences absorbed a tremendous amount of the core energy of the Lotus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They've broken through the Level Five peak and reached Level Six! Level Six elemental essence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Excitement danced in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a level typically only accessible to Celestial Deities and even Deity Overlords, and here he was, a mere Superior Deity, boasting Level Six elemental essence already.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, his power remained rooted in the incredibly potent spatial power and dark power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just that single facet of his ability had more than multiplied his strength tenfold compared to a month ago!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These days, if a group of Transcendent Deity peak warriors like Terrence were to attack me, I wouldn't even break a sweat! Perhaps I could hold my own against a regular Celestial Deity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Too bad Blue Planet doesn't have any Celestial Deities!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that only Celestara boasts warriors of that caliber. If that's the case, I should wrap up things on Blue Planet and head to Celestara."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, Osborne readied himself to exit his seclusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he was about to do so, he paused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "I'll spend some time refining the Eclipsing Mantra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's relatively straightforward to master. I'm confident I can conquer the second and third levels within a few days. Once I've done that, I'll be able to not only conceal my Divine Flame but even disguise it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this plan in mind, Osborne immersed himself in his training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three days later, he finally stepped out of the training chamber, having fully mastered the third level of the Eclipsing Mantra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the true potential of the mantra remained untapped, serving only to cloak and mask his Divine Flame for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you're finally back!" Anastasia and Zoe exclaimed happily as they rushed to greet him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the past month, both had made significant progress in their abilities, though they still had a way to go before reaching the level of Intermediate Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, affectionately ruffling their hair. "Has anything happened while I was away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia nodded, then hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne noticed her unease and asked gently, "What's up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia admitted, "Well, I've been mostly training this month, so I'm not entirely sure. You should ask Grandfather Sebastian. A few days ago, I heard about some sort of trouble, but he told us not to worry, so I didn't ask for details."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raising an eyebrow in concern, Osborne nodded. "Alright, I'll go talk to him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne took Anastasia and Zoe by the hand and headed towards the meeting room.</span></p><div class="pagination">
