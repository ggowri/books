  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hadn't expected that Icy One would outright surrender in the Ascension Three Supernal Deity King match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did I show too much strength? Did it make him lose confidence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was a bit speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a waste!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a hundred Ascension Three Supernal Deity Kings! Osborne had already decided that as soon as those hundred Ascension Three Supernal Deity Kings stepped onto the arena, he would immediately activate the Absolute Forbidden Zone, suppressing their cultivation levels to Ascension One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he would swiftly eliminate all of them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A loss of a hundred Ascension Three Supernal Deity Kings on the arena would be a massive blow to the Paramount Supreme Clan, enough to make them grieve for a long, long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, by absorbing the blood energy from those hundred Ascension Three Supernal Deity Kings, Osborne could help most of the Blood Demon members break through to the peak of the Deity King level, becoming Supernal Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strength of the Blood Demon members would skyrocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a shame!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a bit regretful, but he quickly brushed it off. After all, Icy One had only given up on the Ascension Three Supernal Deity King match. There was no way he would give up on the Ascension Four match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The killing of ten Ascension Four Deity Kings in the arena would hurt the Paramount Supreme Clan even more!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Osborne would gain even more blood energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Icy One hadn't given up on the Ascension Three match and let me use the Absolute Forbidden Zone to eliminate those hundred Ascension Three Supernal Deity Kings, maybe he would have given up on the Ascension Four match too! Comparatively, the value of ten Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings is still higher than a hundred Ascension Three Supernal Deity Kings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After figuring it out, Osborne looked at Ninefold Heaven's Tower provocatively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He declared loudly, "Icy One, your Paramount Supreme Clan has truly disappointed me! I only showed a little bit of strength, and you got scared? You didn't even dare to send anyone to die in the Ascension Three match?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you so afraid that I'll kill them all? Haha! If you're this cowardly, why don't you just concede the Ascension Four match, too? Take your zero wins and eight losses and scram back home. Stop embarrassing yourself out here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After his taunt, the entire Ninefold Heaven's Tower trembled violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, Icy One was furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His icy voice rang out, "Osborne, you're too arrogant! Do you think I'll give up on the Ascension Four match? You're not worthy! If you have the guts, join the Ascension Four match. Let's see how you die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly. "You want me to join the Ascension Four match, so I will? I'm only at Ascension One! I won't join, and I'll make you furious!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you win the last match, it'll still be one win and seven losses! Tsk tsk, is this the mighty Paramount Supreme Clan? Beaten to one win and seven losses by the Human Community?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's expression turned even more enraged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! So you're just a coward, after all! At Ascension One, you've shown strength comparable to Ascension Four, and I thought you'd dare to join the Ascension Four match! Turns out, you only dare to bully the weak! When faced with opponents of similar strength, you don't dare to step onto the arena?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How laughable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One didn't realize Osborne was just toying with him. He believed Osborne truly wouldn't join the Ascension Four match and tried to provoke him further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne found it amusing and decided to play along. "If you're saying it like that, I can't accept it! I was actually ready to step down and give your Paramount Supreme Clan a bit of face, letting you win one match to save some dignity so you wouldn't just quit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But since you're provoking me like this, I won't step down! Not only will I stay, but all of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings will stay! We'll face your Ascension Four warriors head-on and show you that we're not just bullies who pick on the weak!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Osborne even put on an indignant expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Icy One couldn't help but feel overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered, "Good! I admire your courage! But this match is ours to win!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he muttered to himself, "Great! Heaven is on my side! I thought only Osborne would stay in the arena, and my goal was just to find a way to kill him. I never expected he'd be so impulsive, falling for my provocation and deciding to keep all the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings in the arena for the Ascension Four match!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is practically suicide!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One was thrilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Icy One, be careful! The other members of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings don't have the strength to fight Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings, but Osborne is keeping them there. There might be a trap!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Two couldn't help but warn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One sneered, "What trap could there be? It's just arrogance! Or maybe they've already won so much today that they don't care about the outcome of the last match! The only reason they're staying is because Osborne thinks his spatial power will let him escape even if they lose, so he won't die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But he's too naive! Since I know he has spatial power, how could I not prepare for it? In any case, this Ascension Four match is our best chance to eliminate the entire Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Two felt there was some truth to his words but still had a nagging feeling something was off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he couldn't argue further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimately, they all agreed, as this was indeed the best opportunity to eliminate the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Icy One began making arrangements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To ensure they could kill Osborne and the others in the arena, he carefully selected the strongest Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings and equipped them with divine artifacts capable of restricting interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what, the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings must die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if they try to surrender, ignore it! Kill them immediately! As for the God of Light, if she tries to intervene, we'll hold her off for a while!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One solemnly instructed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings from the Paramount Supreme Clan stepped onto the arena with serious expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the Sanctum of Light, everyone was in an uproar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on with Osborne and the others? Why aren't they coming down? Are they really going to participate in the Ascension Four match? This is absolutely unacceptable! They need to come down now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Light!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light ignored the clamoring crowd. Her voice echoed in Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, be careful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings Icy One has sent are the elite of the elite, the geniuses among geniuses! Icy One's goal is undoubtedly to eliminate the entire Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings in the arena!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although I know you have special methods and confidence, you must still be cautious! You can't afford any accidents, understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't reply but calmly looked at the ten Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings across from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings from the Paramount Supreme Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ascension Four was already considered a top-tier warrior in Celestara. Even the Paramount Supreme Clan didn't have many Supernal Deity Kings above Ascension Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If these ten Ascension Four Supernal Deity Kings were all killed in the arena, even the Paramount Supreme Clan would feel the pain for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that case, just kill them!", Osborne thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolute Forbidden Zone!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
