  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Compared to </span><span>Zephyrville</span><span>, Crescentia is just a small town.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Crescentia isn't much bigger than Tempest Fortress City in Zephyr State. Osborne actually couldn't figure out why the zone duel of Eastern Zone 3, such a grand event, would be held in a small town like Crescentia.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just the billions of spectators flooding in could pack Crescentia to the brim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The translocator kept running nonstop, yet many people still couldn't get into Crescentia. If Osborne, Leroy, and Clara weren't contestants, they might not have been able to enter Crescentia either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After arriving in Crescentia, a designated official escorted Osborne, Leroy, and Clara to accommodations reserved exclusively for contestants.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unlike the state duel, this time the accommodations were assigned randomly. There was no preferential treatment for top contenders or favorites, and no ranking-based distinctions in the arrangements.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, Leroy, and Clara's accommodations were right next to each other.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this time, there were still two days until the zone duel, and most of the contestants had already arrived.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When they moved in, they could clearly feel sharp gazes from the surrounding courtyards observing and sizing them up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't mind and let them observe him as they pleased.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He used Elven Sacred Water and entered the Enlightenment State nearly a hundred times, gaining an incredibly profound understanding of the cosmos and himself, which completely transformed his aura.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, his control over his own power reached a very high level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even without the Sublime Concealment Orb, Osborne could easily restrain and conceal his power. Now, trying to probe or see through his strength was almost impossible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Angela couldn't do this, and even the supreme Empyrean Sacredness might not be able to see through his strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy said, "Osborne, I&rsquo;ve got some news."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after, Leroy and Clara arrived at Osborne's courtyard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What news?" he asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "This news is about the battlefield of the zone duel. It's said that the real battlefield of the zone duel is not in Crescentia but on a distant small resource planet."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Outside Crescentia, an incredibly massive Cosmic Translocator has been set up. Once the zone duel begins, that Cosmic Translocator will transport us to a resource planet that has never been explored before."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And we, the contestants, will search for various resources and treasures on that resource planet. In the end, the more resources and treasures found, the higher the ranking."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Leroy finished speaking, Osborne was somewhat surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked, "A small resource planet that has never been explored? That&rsquo;s possible. Do you know exactly which resource planet it is?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy shook his head and said, "I haven't heard any exact news yet. This should be to prevent anyone from going ahead to scout, avoiding unfair situations."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, it&rsquo;s certain that the environment on that resource planet will be very harsh. It&rsquo;s said that some insiders are already trying to collect special treasures, ones that can resist extreme cold, heat, and storms, and their prices have gone up significantly. Those Sacred Elixirs for healing injuries, detoxifying, and restoring Sacred Power have also seen a big price increase," she continued.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Leroy felt a bit worried because they were completely unprepared for this and had no money to buy those things now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy gritted his teeth and said, "Azure Haven Academy is already trying to prepare those things for me, but they&rsquo;re not sure how much they can get. Osborne, is Mystic Sirius Sect helping you prepare?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly and shook his head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mystic Sirius Sect never mentioned any of this to him, let alone helped him prepare.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne didn&rsquo;t mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the face of absolute strength, any last-minute preparation is meaningless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter where the zone duel takes place, he&rsquo;s determined to win the championship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three chatted a bit more before the two women left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, they all needed to adjust their states. Although Leroy and Clara had no specific expectations for the zone </span><span>duel</span><span> results and just wanted to participate in this grand battle, they still hoped to achieve better outcomes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two days passed in a flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because team-ups are not allowed in the zone duel, any contestant caught teaming up will be immediately disqualified. Therefore, this time, no one disturbed Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, the time for the zone duel arrived.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even at this moment, Osborne still didn&rsquo;t know where the actual battlefield of the zone duel was or the specific rules.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, it's time to go!" Leroy and Clara, dressed in sharp combat uniforms, looked strikingly heroic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They each handed a Dimensional Bag to Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, our elders prepared some supplies for us, and we set aside some for you. The items inside can help with detoxification, restoring Sacred Power, and resisting extreme conditions like severe cold or heat. They should be useful to you, so take them," they said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit touched upon seeing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he shook his head, "No need! These are prepared by your elders for you, and they must have cost a lot of Sacred Crystals. I can't take them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two women frowned upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They said, "Osborne, just take it! It's our token of appreciation. After all, without you, we wouldn't have had the chance to participate in the zone duel! Besides, this is also what our elders wanted us to do."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Also, don't forget we each bet 20,000 Sacred Crystals on you winning the championship! If you really win, our 20,000 Sacred Crystals will instantly turn into 2 million!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Compared to that, these things are nothing at all!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You better perform well and make sure to win the championship!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne finally stopped refusing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although he felt he probably wouldn't need these things, carrying them just in case wouldn't hurt. Besides, if he didn't accept them, Leroy and Clara might feel upset.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you both!" he said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne put away the </span><span>two Dimensional</span><span> Bags, and the two women immediately smiled. The three of them had already left their residence and gathered at a spacious training ground.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, all one thousand Zone </span><span>Duel</span><span> participants had arrived.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was sizing each other up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially a few championship favorites, like Valentino Marquez from Rose Rebels, Brenda Ramos from </span><span>Skyearth</span><span> Dominion, as well as Dustin, Mckinley, and Jordan Delgado, had become the center of attention. Countless sharp eyes, filled with fighting spirit and defiance, were now fixed on them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, those who stood out in the State Duel to participate in the Zone Duel were absolute geniuses of their respective forces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were confident and proud, not thinking they were much inferior to anyone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Valentino, Brenda, and others being listed as championship favorites naturally stirred their competitive spirit. Everyone secretly vowed to perform well in the Zone Duel and surpass them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, however, was very calm at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He casually glanced at a few championship favorites, memorized their appearances, and then closed his eyes to rest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, an unexpected incident occurred.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A shocking piece of news began to spread rapidly among the crowd.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Osborne felt countless gazes fixed on him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
