  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, one of the warriors spoke up, his voice tinged with unease. "I can't shake the feeling that something's off about today!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At first, we had the upper hand. Even with the Pantheon League waking up over twenty gods, they were still only at the Intermediate Deity level. They were no match for us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We could have wiped them out then! Sure, we'd have taken some losses, but nothing we couldn't handle. And Mr. Joseph Deschanel, while you were negotiating with Helios, the intensity of the battle was already dying down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But just when it seemed like a deal was within reach, we inexplicably lost several of our own! In that chaotic battlefield, there was a powerful assassin hunting us down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was because of that sudden ambush that the fighting escalated again, and your talks with Helios fell apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Logically, the Pantheon League was at a disadvantage; they would have preferred to end the conflict through negotiation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So why, just when we were on the brink of a truce, did this mysterious warrior from the Pantheon League suddenly kill our people, provoking us and reigniting the war? It doesn't add up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the warrior finished, Joseph's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you suggesting that this assassin might not even be one of Pantheon League's?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warrior nodded vigorously. "Initially, I thought he was one of theirs, given that he was actively helping them by taking out Deschanel Clan members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But upon closer inspection, I noticed that the Pantheon League warriors looked just as confused as we were&mdash;they had no idea who he was!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"During the fighting, I didn't have time to think much about it, but now I can't shake the feeling that something isn't right. This assassin likely doesn't belong to the Pantheon League at all; he could be from a third-party force!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His goal seems to be to keep us from stopping the fight with Pantheon League, while also trying to balance the scales of power between us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since we're stronger, he targets us, aiming to level the playing field. If he hadn't injured two of our Superior Deities in the final moments, leading to their deaths, we wouldn't have had to retreat at all&mdash;we could have taken down the Pantheon League!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now, we're stuck in a stalemate, and neither side can gain the upper hand..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the words hung in the air, not just Joseph, but every member of the Deschanel Clan felt a chill run down their spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's face turned icy. "A third-party force?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, isn't that just a clever scheme! It seems we've walked right into their trap! The one who stole our Sanctuary Caskets likely isn't from the Pantheon League either, but </span><span>rather this third-party group!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're intentionally framing the Pantheon League, pushing us to target the League and spark a war, all while they sit back and reap the benefits!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their aim is probably to weaken both the Deschanel Clan and the Pantheon League to the point of mutual destruction!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Joseph clenched his fists, his teeth grinding together in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been outplayed, manipulated like a pawn on a chessboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is this puppet master pulling our strings? The Court of the Sun? The Prophet Alliance? Or maybe the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's eyes burned with a murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no doubt that it was a powerful force behind this scheme, dismissing the Augustine family as insignificant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, only a dominant faction could orchestrate such a cunning plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A voice, heavy with concern, broke the silence. "I have a feeling it's the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The methods used&mdash;purely the work of a top-tier assassin. His Stealth Art is off the charts, able to materialize behind any of us and strike out of nowhere with that top-grade divine artifact dagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It screams elite killer all over. And who else but the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization has the muscle for such stealthy, lethal maneuvers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's lip curled in a disdainful sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't agree more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a pinnacle assassin from the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization could pull off such a feat&mdash;slicing into a Superior Deity and gutting them well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't just any assassin; this was the cream of the crop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, huh? Well, consider yourselves on the Deschanel Clan's hit list! Once we're back on our feet, our first order of business is wiping out those damn rats."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another voice chimed in, this time tinged with hesitancy, "Mr. Joseph Deschanel, should we try to explain this to the Pantheon League? If the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization's behind this, both us and the Pantheon League are victims. We've all been played."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph scoffed in response, saying, "Explain? After we took down a hundred-plus of their divine warriors and they countered with our eighteen?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We were on amicable terms before, sure, but now? We're mortal enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No explanation will patch that up, so why bother? Besides, the Deschanel Clan is set on ruling this world. Those Pantheon League thorns? They're coming out eventually too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what's our next play?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
