  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Cosmic Translocator is fixed?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately looked over and saw the Cosmic Translocator, which had been damaged by the Magma Devourer, now glowing again thanks to the efforts of the warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It&rsquo;s really fixed!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was excited at this moment. For most of the contestants, the past few days had been far from pleasant. Especially being hunted by the Magma Devourer and endlessly pursued by the Abyssal Planet's native creatures had left them exhausted. They all just wanted to return to the Racial Convergence Planet as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone, enter the Cosmic Translocator and return to the Racial Convergence Planet!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Gerald spoke.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In Crescentia, there&rsquo;s still the award ceremony and the departure ceremony to be held!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, the crowd immediately looked up at the sky.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the leaderboard in the sky had completely frozen. Everyone's results had been tallied, and the top ten were finalized, no longer subject to change.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the name at the very top was naturally Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Incredibly dazzling, especially with Osborne's name followed by the staggering 38 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, it was almost blinding.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Behind Osborne were Clara and Leroy, tied for second place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their Kingdom Duel Scorepoints were both 3 billion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then came Brenda in fourth place, with 820 million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints. That was already a lot; without Osborne, Leroy, and Clara, she would have been incredibly dazzling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Brenda seemed like a joke.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because she was not only not the champion, but also not even the runner-up or third place, and she lost the Legendary Sacred Artifact&mdash;Ice Scepter!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The value of the Ice Scepter alone probably surpassed all her gains.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She really took a huge loss!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, compared to another hot favorite for the championship&mdash;Valentino, Brenda was still lucky. At least she was alive. Valentino, on the other hand, was killed by the Magma Devourer right at the start of the zone duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Over 130 contestants died on Abyssal Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this sense, those who survived were all lucky.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fifth place on the leaderboard is Dustin, with a total score of only 6,400 Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, while the sixth place is Mckinley, with 6,300 Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seventh place...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eighth place...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ninth place...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Tenth place...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone stared at the top ten, somewhat envious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because the top ten will represent Eastern Zone 3 in six months at the royal city of Glorious Divine Kingdom to participate in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel and compete for the highest honor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Jordan didn't make it into the top ten!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Before the zone duel started, Jordan was ranked fifth in the championship odds! In the end, she dropped to fifteenth, not even making the top ten."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At least she's still alive. Valentino was ranked first in the championship odds before the zone duel, but he's already dead! They say not even a complete body was left, crushed into pulp by the Magma Devourer!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, this zone duel relied more on luck than strength! Take Leroy and Clara, for example. Based on strength, they wouldn't even make it into the top hundred and would definitely rank at the very bottom!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But now, they're tied for second place, ranking even higher than Brenda! They, along with Osborne, purely got lucky and stumbled upon the Ice Beetle's tomb after its natural death."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If it were me, I'd be the champion now too!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Exactly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While waiting for the Cosmic Translocator to activate, the crowd was still whispering about the results of this zone duel. It was clear that most of them did not agree with the rankings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They believed the zone duel relied too much on luck and failed to select the true warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were unconvinced by Osborne, Leroy, and Clara.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But no matter how dissatisfied they were, the result couldn't be changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne and the other two also heard the crowd's whispers but didn't care at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These people were just envious and jealous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't need their recognition of his strength. Even if everyone thought Brenda was stronger, it wouldn't matter at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This wouldn't make him weaker, nor would it make Brenda stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was still thinking about how to keep his massive Kingdom Duel Scorepoints after returning to Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His</span><span> Kingdom Duel Scorepoints </span><span>were</span><span> just too many! </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They w</span><span>ould</span><span> definitely attract the envy of many warriors... </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the surface, they might not dare to make a move against </span><span>him</span><span>, but given the chance, they w</span><span>ould</span><span> surely try everything to take </span><span>him</span><span> down and seize </span><span>his</span><span> Kingdom Duel Scorepoints. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I must come up with a plan.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne frowned deeply and discussed with Clara and Leroy through Telepathy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy's Kingdom Duel Scorepoints also reached three billion, enough to exchange for several Legendary Sacred Artifacts in the Glorious Divine Kingdom's treasury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They too would attract the envy of warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the Sects behind them were just ordinary Second-rate Powers, completely incapable of protecting them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We can find a place to hide!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy said, "After the Zone Duel ends, it will take half a year for the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel to begin! This half year is very dangerous for us, and we must find a safe enough place to get through it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara also nodded. "And we must act quickly! For now, only those watching from Crescentia know we have so many Kingdom Duel Scorepoints... but after some time, the entire Glorious Divine Kingdom might find out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"By then, even more people will come after us, trying to seize our Kingdom Duel Scorepoints!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hiding is the simplest and most effective way, but where to hide?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had an idea in mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he still wanted to seek Leroy and Clara's opinions, so he asked, "Do you know anywhere safe?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy and Clara exchanged a glance, then shook their heads in unison.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We've always been focused on cultivating within the Sect and rarely left, so we're not familiar with the outside world and don't know where's safe."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and said, "In that case, let's go with my idea!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy and Clara nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne had become the most trustworthy person in their hearts, even surpassing their sect elders. Whatever Osborne said, they would do.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't leave my side!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"After the award ceremony and the departure ceremony, I'll take you away immediately! If everything goes smoothly, no one should be able to catch up..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A sharp gleam flashed in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He decided to find a hidden corner immediately after the award ceremony, tear open Space, and take the two women into deep space. The environment in deep space is complex, filled with dangerous Chrono-Spatial Turbulence everywhere.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In such an environment, Osborne was confident that even if a warrior wanted to hunt them down, they would never succeed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if it were an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They still wouldn't catch up with them!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Too bad the Sublime Concealment Orb is with Agatha. Otherwise, with the Sublime Concealment Orb, it would be even easier to hide! As long as I want, no one could ever find us!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Osborne was thinking, the Cosmic Translocator finally activated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a bout of dizziness, Osborne found himself back in Crescentia on the Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Around him were billions of spectators.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, all these billions of spectators turned their gaze toward Osborne.</span></p><div class="pagination">
