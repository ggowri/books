  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne finished speaking, shock swept over Wesson and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You plan to slip away from the Augustine Estate using your spatial power to rescue the Draco Armed Services Branch?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged worried glances, their brows furrowed tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson's expression turned serious. "No way! That's way too dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what the Aberrants is launching against the Augustine family is a true annihilation campaign, unlike anything we faced before. The strength they're bringing to the table this time is far beyond that of past skirmishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All of Gerardo's disciples and guards are involved, along with a horde of Class AAA clones, even some Class S clones. In a war like this, unless you're a top-tier Class S powerhouse, individual strength can't tip the scales.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"While your current abilities are impressive&mdash;frankly, even I'd probably lose if we fought&mdash;I can assure you that you're still not on par with the elite Class S fighters. Going out there alone to save the Draco Armed Services Branch is a recipe for disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you get surrounded, you could be putting your life at serious risk! If something happens to you, the Augustine family and the Draco Group will be truly doomed," Wesson warned, genuine concern etched across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miranda chimed in, "Wesson's right. The former Godfather entrusted the Draco Group to you. You're our new Godfather. Losing the Draco Armed Services Branch is one thing, but losing you? That's not an option!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't agree to you risking everything to save them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a mix of helplessness and gratitude. He understood that both Wesson and Miranda were worried for his safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said calmly, "Listen, the Draco Armed Services Branch has to be rescued! If they're wiped out, the entire Draco Group will spiral into chaos. And trust me, I know what I'm doing; I'm confident in my abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa entrusted the Draco Group to me, and that's exactly why I must step up! I can't just stand by while the Aberrants destroy the Draco Armed Services Branch and seize control of our assets!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm set on this decision. Please don't try to change my mind; instead, think about how you can divert Rumen and Everett's attention so I can leave without alerting anyone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, Wesson, Miranda, Fiona, and Ashley all remained tense, their brows still knitted. Yet, looking at the determination in Osborne's eyes, they struggled to voice further objections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson finally relented, knowing that if Osborne was resolved, there was no stopping him. It was better to coordinate than to resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miranda nodded, adding, "I will send Serena and the other four with you! They're only Class AAA; even if they leave, Rumen and Everett likely won't notice. Having their help will put my mind at ease."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment but then agreed with a nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His space elemental essence had grown significantly stronger. Even with Serena and the others, interdimensional travel shouldn't be an issue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They quickly discussed strategies to attract Rumen and Everett's attention while ensuring Osborne could discreetly harness his spatial power to exit unnoticed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Wesson, Miranda, Fiona, and Ashley stepped outside the Augustine family boundaries, their eyes narrowed in determination, locked on a distant spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson called out, his voice echoing, "Rumen, Everett! How long do you plan to keep the Augustine family surrounded? You've gone too far! Come and face us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost instantly, Rumen and Everett appeared, their expressions dripping with scorn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wesson, you're asking for death! You dare to challenge us? Just the four of you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you're looking for death, we'll gladly oblige!" Rumen declared, a menacing grin spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Rumen and Everett sprang into action simultaneously, unleashing terrifying attacks that instantly engulfed the four of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a heartbeat, the battle erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson, Miranda, and the others may have had the numbers on their side, but they were no match for Rumen and Everett. They quickly found themselves in a perilous situation. Fortunately, they were close enough to the Augustine family territory, and they managed to retreat just in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen and Everett hesitated for a moment but ultimately decided against pursuing them into the safety of the Augustine family's grounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They only issued a chilling threat. "Hmph! If you dare to come out again, we'll kill you! And that's for every one of you Augustine family members that shows their face!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the two of them melted back into the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What they didn't notice was that while they were engaged with Wesson and the others, Osborne had already taken Serena and the four Sebastian maidservants and slipped away from the Augustine Estate through interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the chaos of battle, no one had registered the faint ripples of space as they moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sixty miles out at sea, Osborne and his group emerged abruptly from a dimensional rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, are you really planning to rescue the Draco Armed Services Branch? With just the six of us, it's impossible to pull it off. And we could end up in even deeper trouble," Serena said, concern etched on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled reassuringly, "Ms. Hernandez, trust me, I've got a plan. Besides, we're not alone in this!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
