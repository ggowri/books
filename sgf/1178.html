  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Becoming a Junior Deity had sent Osborne's strength skyrocketing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just how powerful he was now remained a mystery, but he was confident that he could effortlessly wipe the floor with his pre-transformation self.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne knew that simply being a Junior Deity wasn't nearly enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the grand scheme of the Age of Gods, his current abilities placed him at the very bottom of the hierarchy. Junior Deities back then were like the common folk today&mdash;utterly incapable of defending themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer might of the Age of Gods was staggering, but it had all been shattered by Lord Malevolence and his minions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with the possibility of Lord Malevolence's return looming over him, Osborne felt a gnawing sense of insecurity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the dark lord came back stronger than ever, he would need to bolster his own power, and fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne felt the changes coursing through his body, his gaze locked onto the nine strands of core energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Divine Body had completed its transformation, but there was still a wealth of energy left in those strands&mdash;more than half remained untouched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The potential within them was immense and far beyond anything he had encountered before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can I harness this energy to further enhance my strength?" Osborne pondered, deep in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was still merging with him, and now that his Divine Body had been successfully forged, the vibrations from the Lotus no longer posed any threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The integration was destined to succeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, this was only the second phase of the merging process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once completed, the blood and cells of Osborne's body would be fortified by the Lotus' power, granting him a preliminary form of immortality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if his body were reduced to dust, as long as his soul endured, he could regenerate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was far more potent than the Light of Redemption!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the fusion was complete, Osborne's power would surge, and he wouldn't have to fear injury anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But how should I utilize these nine strands of core energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should I use them to further enhance my Divine Body?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, that won't work! My Divine Body has already reached its peak at this level. To grow stronger, I need to elevate my realm first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder if I can use this energy to boost my elemental essences?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a spark ignited in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why not give it a shot?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne resolved to try. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, he had been able to absorb star power to enhance his elemental essences, so it stood to reason that the energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, being of a far higher caliber, would also elevate his elemental essences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stronger his elemental essences, the more formidable his powers would become.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before I dive in, though, I should nail down the direction of my primary power focus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thunder Power? Yeah, that's got to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't have much of a knack for it, so pouring time and energy into it just doesn't make sense. Besides, my body is my greatest asset. Spreading myself too thin across multiple powers could backfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I face a formidable opponent, I might find myself unable to leverage my strengths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's better to specialize in one power&mdash;maybe two at most!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With clarity settling in his mind, Osborne felt a renewed sense of purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He observed his elemental essence, noting that the most powerful of them was the light elemental essence, which had reached the pinnacle of Level Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just one more push, and he could hit Level Five. At that point, his Light Realm would weave itself into the fabric of time and space, evolving into a Level Five Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aside from that, he had four other elemental essences&mdash;space, lightning, psychic, and dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of these had attained Level Three, with the space elemental essence standing out at the peak of Level Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, eyebrows furrowing, "Isn't it strange? I never made dark elemental essence my main focus, yet here it is at Level Three, even keeping pace with my lightning and psychic essences. How is that possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a mix of surprise and intrigue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that I actually have some talent for dark power?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's a real possibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But spatial power? That's a must! I can't afford to overlook it. Without spatial power, escaping from formidable foes would be a nightmare!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, spatial power has to stay in my arsenal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then I'll need to choose between Light Power and Dark Power for my main focus. I can only afford to specialize deeply in two kinds of power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He furrowed his brow, deep in contemplation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logically, his light elemental essence was already at Level Four, while his dark elemental essence was still at Level Three&mdash;a huge disparity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would make sense to continue diving deeper into Light Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, for some reason, he felt a stronger pull toward his dark elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My light elemental essence is so powerful because it's my primary focus&mdash;I've dedicated tons of time to leveling it up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, it was extracted from the God of Star, so there's a natural strength there! The truth is, I don't think I have much talent when it comes to Light Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I stick with it, I sense my ceiling might be rather low.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the flip side, dark elemental essence&mdash;something I've barely trained&mdash;has already caught up! So, given all that..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
