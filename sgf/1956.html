  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I really creating a monster here?" Osborne couldn't help but exclaim in shock after assessing the state of the Infinite Devouring Eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He noticed that the Infinite Devouring Eyes had transformed completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After devouring the Crimson Energy from the Bloodstrike Orb and 30 percent of the Tree Heart's energy, it felt foreign to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A powerful defensive barrier now enveloped it, providing complete protection. This very force had easily deflected Primordial's root attacks, rendering them almost laughable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, a vast ocean of energy surged like a tempestuous sea!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vibrant energy churned wildly, and among it lay a fragment of a decayed root that hadn't been fully digested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a piece of the World Tree's root, rich in pure energy, something Osborne had fed to the Infinite Devouring Eyes long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, the Infinite Devouring Eyes would refine the pure energy from this root to help Osborne elevate his own power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, it seemed to be hoarding that refined energy for itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Osborne furrow his brow in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This Infinite Devouring Eyes has so much energy, yet it's not helping me advance?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, it's keeping it all for itself?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I could absorb all that energy, I could probably break through to Supernal Deity King! Why isn't it just handing it over?" Osborne grumbled internally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he finished his thought, a surge of energy erupted from within the Infinite Devouring Eyes, flowing like a stream into Osborne's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a torrent of energy flooding into him, his eyes widening in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's too fast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer volume of energy pouring into him was all refined by the Infinite Devouring Eyes, and Osborne didn't have to do a thing. He could feel his power level skyrocketing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments ago, he had barely reached the highest Deity King Level, but now his cultivation level was racing toward something even higher, Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been ages since he experienced such a rapid surge in power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his current level, each incremental advancement required an astronomical amount of energy, dozens or even hundreds of times more than what other cultivators needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So even with the help of the Infinite Devouring Eyes, his progress had been slow, lagging behind the likes of Anastasia and Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had always been a notch above him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with the Infinite Devouring Eyes channeling pure energy into him, Osborne found himself quickly catching up to and even surpassing them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy was so immense that it formed a radiant sphere around him, radiating terrifying waves of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Primordial had finally absorbed the last remnants of energy from the Tree Heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It returned to Osborne's Soul Current Ocean, sensing the drastic change in his state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on with you? Your power is skyrocketing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such pure energy! Damn it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That wretched eye stole my Tree Heart energy, and now it's all benefiting you!" Primordial exclaimed, a hint of annoyance in its voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't be bothered to respond. He felt like a balloon on the verge of bursting, filled to the brim with energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne found himself at the ultimate limit of the highest Deity King Level. One more step forward, and he would have to merge his Divine Flame with his Infinite Sacred Body to ascend to the status of Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to his dismay, he realized that his Divine Flame and Infinite Sacred Body showed no signs of merging at all. Osborne felt the energy swelling within him, yet he couldn't find the breakthrough he desperately needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this went on, he genuinely felt like he might explode from the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anxiety started creeping in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? Why can't I break through to Supernal Deity King even when I'm at this level?" he hurriedly inquired from Primordial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial, having shifted from mere complaints to a serious demeanor upon sensing Osborne's unusual condition, replied, "Can't break through to Supernal Deity King?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't panic just yet! Let me dig through my memories to figure this out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne bit his lip, feeling the strain. The vast energy was causing fissures to form all over his body, each crack a testament to the strain he was under.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body had already transcended Level Ten Divine Body and was at Infinite Sacred Body level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How strong was an Infinite Sacred Body?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, here he was, on the brink of bursting from an overload of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly commanded the Infinite Devouring Eyes, "Enough! No more energy, just stop it already!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to his frustration, Osborne realized once more that he had lost control over it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Energy continued to surge into him relentlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of his body splitting echoed in his ears, and his face paled in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Primordial's voice cut through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I'm not clear on why you can't advance to Supernal Deity King! Given the energy concentration within you, you should have already broken through!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes. "That's obvious! The energy concentration in me is at least 100, maybe even 1000 times stronger than that of an average Deity King at their highest! And it's still rising! Anyone else would've surpassed it by now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial quickly responded, "Exactly! I believe the reason you can't move forward might be due to the environment here! Or maybe the rules of nature are holding you back! You need to get out of here, to a place where the natural order is normal, and then you can make your breakthrough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned again, "But right now, I can't even move! I can't use any energy, or I'll explode immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial fell silent for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Figure something out! If I die, you're not making it either! You just absorbed a Tree Heart; you aren't keen on dying like this, are you?" Osborne urged Primordial to think quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Primordial finally spoke again, "If you want to avoid death, the only way is to compress the massive energy within you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne grimaced. "Compress the energy again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of solution is that? The energy in me is already extremely pure and formidable! It's nearly impossible to compress any further!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial replied with frustration, "You can't, but I can! Damn it! I worked too hard to gain this Tree Heart energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I haven't fully absorbed it, and now I have to waste it on you! Right now, I seriously suspect that your bizarre eye is doing this on purpose!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's trying to force you into a crisis, pushing me to use the Tree Heart energy to help compress your energy, making you stronger!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
