  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! Osborne, that's cheating!" Alfreda exclaimed, watching as Osborne zipped around with his spatial power, snatching up Element Gold Crystals at an alarming rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anxiety set in as she realized he was far outpacing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each Element Gold Crystal held immense elemental essence energy, and despite their compact, fist-sized appearance, they were incredibly heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, these crystals repelled any other energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how powerful one might be, they could only approach the crystals and pick them up with their hands&mdash;using divine power or telekinesis was off the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, Desmond and Monica would have easily scooped them up with their powers, without needing to fight the Soulreaver Vine first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's use of interdimensional travel made him lightning-fast. Although it was still affected by the limitations </span><span>in</span><span> Umbra Earth&mdash;where he could only travel a few miles at a time&mdash;he was still much quicker than Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he collected over a dozen crystals, Alfreda had barely managed to grab her second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cheating! This is totally unfair!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're using spatial power!" she complained, but her hands didn't stop moving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She dashed toward the third Element Gold Crystal and scooped it up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Desmond and Monica were even more frantic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stood in shock, watching as Osborne and Alfreda swept in with blinding speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as they had planned to rush forward and claim the crystals, the duo had already snatched up most of them, leaving them in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, all twenty-eight Element Gold Crystals had vanished into Osborne and Alfreda's possession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desmond's face darkened, a storm brewing within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're dead meat!" he roared, his eyes blazing as he glared at the scattered crystals that had slipped through their fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fury surged, turning his gaze a fiery red as a murderous intent boiled over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had fought tooth and nail against the powerful Soulreaver Vine for nearly an hour, losing over twenty squad members in the process. Exhausted and nearly drained of divine power, they had finally succeeded in bringing the beast down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, just as they were about to reap their hard-earned rewards, two thieves had swooped in and stolen it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hand over the Element Gold Crystals!" Desmond demanded, his icy glare fixed on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cold malice radiating from him sent shivers down the spines of the weary Fire Elf Clan Royal Family guards, who quickly rallied to surround the two thieves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their anger was palpable, eyes locked onto Osborne and Alfreda with fierce determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne and Alfreda exchanged glances, unfazed by the growing hostility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won! I collected twenty-one Element Gold Crystals!" Osborne declared, grinning triumphantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda huffed in frustration, "I only got seven! But I'm not satisfied because you cheated! If I had spatial power, I would've beaten you for sure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged, a playful smirk on his face. "But you don't!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever! I'm still not backing down! And remember, our competition isn't just about snatching crystals! We also have to see who can take down more enemies!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alfreda's gaze hardened as she turned to face Monica and Desmond, along with the nearly hundred elite guards of the Fire Elf Clan Royal Family. Her eyes glinted with fierce battle intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alfreda, you little bastard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hand over the Element Gold Crystals now, or I swear I'll make you pay!" Monica growled, her eyes narrowing with lethal intent as she locked her gaze on Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda wore a cold smile. "Kill me? Monica, you think you can take me down with your pathetic skills?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've put up with you for far too long! Time and again, you've provoked me in Elf City, even sending your father to bully mine. Do you really think I don't have a breaking point? I couldn't deal with you back in Elf City, but here on Umbra Earth...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, we settle this once and for all! It's either you or me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Monica's expression hardened. She sensed the chilling intent radiating from Alfreda. For a moment, panic flickered in her eyes, but she quickly regained her composure, bolstered by the nearly hundred strong guards of the Fire Elf Clan Royal Family surrounding her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had nearly a hundred allies at her back, while Alfreda had just Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Monica couldn't help but scoff at the sight of him. Just a lowly human who had barely reached Ascension One before entering Umbra Earth&mdash;he was nothing to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her mind, they only needed to deal with Alfreda!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>True, Alfreda was an Ascension Five, more powerful than Monica, but their exploration team boasted over a dozen Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how strong Alfreda was, she couldn't possibly stand against them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Monica sneered and said, "Alfreda, you've lost your mind! You think you and your little human sidekick can take on nearly a hundred of us? And you dare to steal our Element Gold Crystals?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you're looking for death, I'll be happy to oblige!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shot a glance at Desmond, who mirrored her icy demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He regarded Osborne with disdain, his thoughts aligned with Monica's. After all, Osborne's cultivation level was far too low to be a threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a dismissive glance at Osborne, Desmond focused on Alfreda. "Princess Alfreda, this isn't very dignified, is it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We discovered these Element Gold Crystals first! We lost over twenty squad members just to bring down that Ascension Six Soulreaver Vine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're nothing but thieves, swooping in to snatch what's rightfully ours while we were relaxing! If you hand over the Element Gold Crystals, I might let you walk away alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, I'll have no choice but to order an attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Alfreda wore a look of utter disdain on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Desmond, what the hell are you talking about? This is Umbra Earth. You haven't even got your hands on those Element Gold Crystals yet. Why the hell can't I take them? Calling me a thief?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, if I'm going to be a thief today, then so be it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quit the chatter! If you want to fight, let's get to it. You're making me sick!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she made a dramatic gagging gesture towards Desmond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face turned a deep shade of anger. He clenched his fists, fighting to keep his rage in check.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, fine! You're asking for it! Since you want this, then..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desmond's voice turned cold as he raised his hand, issuing the order. "Kill them! Get back our Element Gold Crystals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, nearly a hundred guards from the Fire Elf Royal Family sprang into action, their gaze fierce as they charged toward Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With over a dozen Ascension Fives and more than eighty Ascension Fours, they were a formidable force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with this overwhelming onslaught, Alfreda's expression grew serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tensed up and quickly glanced at Osborne. "Osborne, you good?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled reassuringly, "I'm fine, don't worry about me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda nodded, determination flashing in her eyes. "Alright then! Let's see who can take down more enemies! Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fire ignited in her spirit, Alfreda sprang into action, ready to unleash chaos.</span></p><div class="pagination">
