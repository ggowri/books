  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tyson! What do you think you're doing?!" Jamar </span><span>shouted,</span><span> his voice laced with frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone would be furious when faced with such an aggressive presence, especially one that seemed intent on provoking them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! </span><span>What does</span><span> look like?" Tyson laughed, a booming sound that filled the air. "I'm just here to say hello and see if your Mystic Sirius Sect disciples have improved over the years!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't back down from Jamar's shout; if anything, he intensified his aura, a tidal wave of pressure crashing down on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar, Bethan, and the others felt their faces pale as they struggled to hold their ground, channeling their own power just to remain upright. Anger and frustration were etched on their features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson sneered and said, "Looks like you haven't made any progress at all! You're all a bunch of trash. If you run into me on the city </span><span>duel</span><span> stage, just surrender right away! Otherwise, don't blame me for being ruthless. My real opponents are Leroy and Marreese from Azure Haven Academy. I don't want to waste my energy on you worthless losers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it?" he added, his expression dripping with arrogance, eyes locking onto Jamar and Bethan as if they were nothing more than insects beneath his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tyson, you're out of line!" Jamar shot back, his anger boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson scoffed. "Out of line? Maybe it's not me who's arrogant, but you lot who are just pathetic! If you've got a problem with that, why don't you try and do something about it right now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze turned icy, and Jamar and Bethan felt a chill run down their spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The humiliation was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't just a challenge; it was an outright insult to the Mystic Sirius Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the weight of Tyson's terrifying energy left them speechless. They knew that if they met him on the </span><span>duel</span><span> stage, they'd stand no chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustration bubbled within them, but they felt utterly powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this world, there was a straightforward principle&mdash;the strong ruled. The powerful could look down on and mock the weak, and if one wanted to fight back, they had to have the strength to match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they exchanged looks, their eyes all turned to Osborne, filled with hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he was the champion of the Mystic Sirius Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wore the sect's champion medal on his chest with pride, a clear marker of his lofty status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was hoping he'd step forward to take on Tyson and redeem their honor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without saying a word, he simply waved his hand nonchalantly. In an instant, Tyson's overbearing energy dissipated, and then he started walking back to his quarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said in a laid-back tone, "Let's go! No point wasting our time on a yapping cur."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't have cared less about Tyson's deliberate provocation. It was like walking down the street and getting barked at by a rabid dog. No one in their right mind would fight a rabid dog, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any grudges could wait until the official start of the city duel. They'd sort things out in the ring then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's nonchalance in the face of Tyson's blatant provocation came as a breath of fresh air to Jamar and Bethan, instantly boosting their morale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Tyson's expression soured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed his steely gaze on Osborne, his features hardening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This guy has actually managed to shatter my oppressive pressure? Impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Tyson's eyes landed on the champion medal on Osborne's chest, and a glimmer of interest flashed in them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, so you're the big dark horse from the Mystic Sirius Sect&mdash;Osborne! Not bad, not bad! You're not caving in under my pressure. You've got some chops! I checked your file, and it says you're just an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King. I could hardly believe it at first! How did someone like you manage to become the champion of the Mystic Sirius Sect? Are there no decent folks left in that sect?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now I can see you're actually quite talented! But how dare you call me a yapping cur? Who do you think you are? You're just asking for trouble!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Tyson unleashed an even mightier energy, bearing down on Osborne like a tempest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had no option but to stop in his tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he kept his cool, his expression serene as he retorted, "Calling you a yapping cur would be an insult to real dogs! It seems your </span><span>brain's</span><span> on the fritz. Consider this your warning&mdash;don't mess with me, or I swear you'll live to regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, a searing killing intent burst forth from Osborne, instantly shattering Tyson's overbearing energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson's face turned ashen, and he staggered back a few steps. A twinge of panic and fear shot through him at Osborne's sheer intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that only stoked the flames of his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes flared a deep, blood-red, and he was itching to lash out. Just then, a taunting voice sliced through the tense atmosphere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, quite the spectacle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From afar, several towering figures shot forward like lightning, closing the distance in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson's expression hardened as he recognized them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marreese!" Tyson gritted through his teeth, his attention completely diverted to the newcomers, forgetting all about Osborne and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of Fantasia Isle behind him tensed up at the sight of Marreese.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the undefeated champion of the last city duel, a true powerhouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last time, he had mowed down his opponents effortlessly. His blade had cut down anyone foolish enough to oppose him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a brutal showdown, he had vanquished Tyson. After a relentless barrage of ninety-nine strikes, he had shattered Tyson's defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, it was this slim advantage that saw Marreese declared the winner by the referee and crowned champion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson had never come to terms with that defeat, firmly believing that he could defeat Marreese if given another shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with the new city duel on the horizon, Tyson saw his opportunity for revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle spirit surged within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marreese, however, remained unfazed. With a calm smile, he addressed Tyson, "Listen up, Tyson. This is Azure Haven Academy, not your playground at Fantasia Isle. If you want to throw punches, you can wait until the city </span><span>duel</span><span> stage. For now, it's best you keep your head down and avoid trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or you'll feel my wrath!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was measured, but the underlying threat was unmistakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze swept over the crowd, including Osborne and the Mystic Sirius Sect disciples, making it clear that he wouldn't tolerate any nonsense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned but chose to remain silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson, however, seethed with anger. "Marreese, what's with the arrogance? I heard you got taken down by someone&mdash;a woman, no less! You're not even the top disciple at Azure Haven Academy anymore, are you? Ha! What a loser!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marreese's brows snapped down into a sharp V, and his eyes narrowed to cold, menacing slits. "Yeah, I lost to a woman named Leroy. But I lost with dignity. If you think you're better than me, I hope you run into Leroy on the stage. She'll set you straight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a dismissive wave of his hand, Marreese added, "Now, clear out! This is Azure Haven Academy. If anyone causes trouble here, don't say I didn't warn you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His companions unleashed their energy, their glares as cold as ice, firmly fixed on Tyson and his gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson let out a disdainful snort but managed to rein in his temper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, fine! I'll do Azure Haven Academy a favor today. But on that stage, if you dare to cross my path, I swear I'll leave you all needing stretchers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Tyson stomped off, his fury practically radiating from him as he led his group away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne simply clamped his lips shut, spun around on his heel, and headed straight back to his quarters.</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
