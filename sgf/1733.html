  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fierce battle on the floating mountain had come to a halt, all thanks to Alfred's unexpected intervention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, warriors from the Bowman family, Demonic Dragon Clan, and Soaring Lion Clan still encircled the Mystic Feather Clan, trapping them within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes from the Mystic Feather Clan were on their Deity King warrior, filled with hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was their last chance; if he could defeat Alfred, they might just survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was their only opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and the others, who had been ready to attack, found themselves pausing at this unexpected turn of events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred was actually challenging all the Deity Kings of the Mystic Feather Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce frowned, a scoff escaping his lips. "What a confidence boost!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's on par with us, yet he dares to challenge all the Deity Kings of the Mystic Feather Clan? Does he really think he can take them all down? I certainly wouldn't bet on it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne looked surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred was indeed exuding confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Guess we'll find out," Osborne mused, deciding to hold back for now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred was already on Hannah's list of super geniuses, so it would be interesting to see just how strong he really was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne chose to stay in the shadows for the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred smiled, "Alright! Let's start with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, divine power surged around him, enveloping him in a shroud of </span><span>darkness, transforming him into an imposing black sphere that radiated an unsettling aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Mystic Feather Clan's Deity King warrior felt the weight of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that some exceptionally talented individuals at the peak of Deity Overlord could, indeed, defeat Deity Kings. Having never witnessed it firsthand, he was both impressed and wary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred's confidence suggested he was more than capable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, as a Deity King warrior, he had faith in his own strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, the Deity King launched an attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming force of a Deity King erupted, hurtling toward Alfred with tremendous power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was merely a probing strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a sharp longsword appeared in Alfred's hand, and with a graceful flick, he shattered the incoming attack as if it were nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ease of his movements left the onlookers stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deity King's expression darkened. "The Supreme Malevolence Sword!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you wield it, you're still just a peak Deity Overlord! I refuse to believe you can defeat me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he abandoned any pretense of caution and unleashed his full power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waves of terrifying energy surged toward Alfred, a barrage that blotted out the sky, sending chills through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Alfred stood his ground, unyielding, a smirk appearing on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that all you've got? I don't have time to waste on you! Just give in already!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he charged directly into the oncoming storm of attacks. The strikes crashed against his dark energy, sending ripples through the air, but they failed to break through his defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred swung the Supreme Malevolence Sword once more, and a blinding flash of sword light sliced through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd squinted, momentarily blinded by the brilliance, as an enormous beam of light shot toward the Mystic Feather Clan's Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock washed over the warrior's face as he scrambled to defend himself, throwing up all his protective barriers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fearsome sword light tore through his divine power defenses like paper, leaving a horrific gash across his Divine Body, nearly cleaving him in two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deity King let out a piercing scream as his body was launched backward, crashing hard against the ground. It took him several moments to gather himself, struggling to rise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pathetic! Next!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred sneered, his expression a mix of arrogance and disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An eerie silence fell over the crowd; everyone was stunned into shock as they stared at Alfred, their faces etched with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfred had just defeated a Deity King warrior</span><span>, </span><span>not just defeated, but utterly </span><span>demolished him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had first blocked the Deity King's full-force attack with sheer defense and then dispatched the warrior with a single strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The display of power was overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a mid-stage Deity King warrior would find it challenging to defeat a regular Deity King with such ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Bryce and Kendra looked taken aback, mouths agape as they processed what had just happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell? How is he this strong? Is he really just a peak Deity Overlord?" Bryce frowned in disbelief. "Hannah, you said he was low on your list, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's gaze flickered to the defeated Mystic Feather Clan Deity King; her lips pressed into a tight line of worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Bryce's question, she nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alfred is indeed ranked lower on my list. The ease with which he defeated that Deity King isn't solely due to his own strength. It's also about his gear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He wields the Supreme Malevolence Sword, which drastically boosts his attack power, at least several times over!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And then there's the Supreme Malevolence Shield</span><span>. M</span><span>ost Deity Kings will struggle to break through its defenses!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Hannah's brow furrowed further, anxiety creeping onto her features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce sighed in relief, saying, "So, he's relying on his equipment after all!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
