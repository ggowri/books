  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne observed, even Alfreda's expression shifted to one of profound respect when she looked at the Oracle Heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She explained, her voice filled with admiration, "That's Uriel Rosedale, the Oracle Heir of the Ethereal Elven Temple! He's ranked third among the Oracle Heirs and is the youngest in the top ten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He was once the first Oracle Heir of the Ethereal Elven Temple ten thousand years ago. But during a major exploration of Umbra Earth, he encountered a super genius from the Angel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To protect his team, he stayed behind to hold off that Angel Clan prodigy, buying time for his members to escape. In the end, he was defeated and killed, his soul entering the cycle of reincarnation. But because of his sacrifice, his team members survived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Some of those he saved became kings, others high-ranking priests... even the current leader of the Ethereal Elven Temple was once one of his team members, owing his life to Uriel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uriel was fortunate, though. His soul wasn't shattered by the Power of Reincarnation. After ten thousand years, he awoke from his slumber, and in less than fifty years, he regained his strength, reaching the Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King level again. Now, he's the third Oracle Heir once more!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His talent and potential in this life surpass what he displayed a millennium ago. Given some more time, he's bound to reclaim his title as the first Oracle Heir of the Ethereal Elven Temple!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He could even become the next leader of the Temple, one of the most powerful elves in Elf City!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne listened, utterly captivated by the story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured, "The first Oracle Heir from ten thousand years ago... reincarnated?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Memories revived less than a century ago, and already he's reached the Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King level?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Uriel, his expression grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was struck by the parallels to Ophelia. "She, too, came back from the cycle of reincarnation," he thought, recalling the God of Time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's situation mirrored Uriel's, but she was luckier; her soul had not shattered either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a mere thousand years in the cycle, she had regained her memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel, on the other hand, had taken ten thousand years!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every warrior who reached the Supernal Deity King level possessed a remarkably strong soul. After suffering severe injuries, dying, or reaching the end of their lifespan, they could actively enter the cycle of reincarnation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If fortune favored them, their memories would remain intact, allowing them to tap into their past experiences and accelerate their cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, most who entered reincarnation found their soul power obliterated by the terrifying Power of Reincarnation, losing their memories in the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those like Uriel and Ophelia, who retained their memories, were few and far between.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but feel a twinge of envy as he gazed at Uriel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Alfreda's voice echoed in his mind, grave and urgent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, whatever you do, don't provoke Uriel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why not?" he shot back, curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda explained, her expression serious, "Because Uriel has a bit of a temper!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know why, but since regaining his memories, he's been incredibly volatile. He flies off the handle at the slightest thing! His status in Elf City is high, and anyone who crosses him usually ends up regretting it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Many of those he saved are now high-ranking officials in Elf City! Among the eight great elven kings, three owe their lives to him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even the leader of the Ethereal Elven Temple owes him a debt of gratitude!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused, her expression turning serious. "In many ways, Uriel's status in Elf City rivals that of the elven kings. If you provoke him, it could spell serious trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My father once warned me never to provoke Uriel, for even he couldn't save me if I did."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, understanding the gravity of her words. "I get it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the war drums of the Ethereal Elven Temple echoed throughout the arena, followed by a commanding voice that resonated with authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time's up! It's time to set off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's the voice of the temple leader!" Alfreda murmured, her eyes widening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly activated Satan's Eye, eager to catch a glimpse of the temple leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he did, his expression turned to one of shock. The world around him blurred into a blinding white, an intense light that made even his enhanced vision ache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood vessels strained in his eyes as he instinctively turned away, his heart racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Satan's Eye was injured, and yet, Osborne hadn't seen anything except a dazzling silhouette!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that the leader of the Ethereal Elven Temple? What kind of power does he possess that my Satan's Eye can't even bear to look at him?" Osborne thought, a wave of astonishment washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a first for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could he be... an Empyrean Sacredness warrior?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Above the Supernal Deity King level lies the Empyrean Sacredness warrior, the pinnacle of existence in the vast cosmos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If an Empyrean Sacredness warrior chose to, they could obliterate stars with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is the leader of the Ethereal Elven Temple truly one of them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a mix of uncertainty and awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One thing was clear: as a user of Light Power, the temple leader far surpassed the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were in entirely different leagues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Set off!" The temple master of the Ethereal Elven Temple spoke again, seemingly unaware or uncaring about Osborne's prying gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, a web of intricate light patterns spread out beneath their feet, enveloping the entire Combat Arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive hexagram formation appeared in mid-air, shimmering with energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a Spatial Translocator!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arena erupted with excitement as nearly ten thousand members from the hundred exploration teams buzzed with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each face lit up with exhilaration at the prospect of their upcoming adventure in Umbra Earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The temple leader's voice echoed once more, "The Umbra Earth we're heading to is a medium-sized planet! In one month, it will drift away from Elf City, leaving the deep space and returning to the Umbra World...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll have only a month to explore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After a month, regardless of your gains, you must leave the Umbra Earth continent immediately! Otherwise, you'll follow it through the Umbra World barrier, and with your current strength, you won't be able to pass through!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At that moment, your bodies and souls will be utterly shattered, leaving no chance for reincarnation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, take care of yourselves!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope you all return alive in a month..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the temple leader's words resonated, and the hexagram formation erupted in a brilliant light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, nearly ten thousand souls vanished from the Combat Arena, all entering the teleportation passage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their destination?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mysterious and perilous Umbra Earth continent!</span></p><div class="pagination">
