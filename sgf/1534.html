  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey nodded, a determined glint in his eyes. "Good! Let's head in right now. If we actually find a Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, I won't shortchange you two!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Myron and Sara exchanged excited </span><span>glances,</span><span> their anticipation palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Tobey Bowman, that over there is the main mine! It leads straight down to the deepest part of the mining area!" Myron exclaimed, pointing ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a confident nod, Tobey tossed the Supreme Malevolence Airship into the air, and it instantly transformed into a sleek, small vessel, barely 16 feet long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Supreme Malevolence Airship was versatile; unlike other Malevolence Airships that couldn't navigate the tight confines of a mine, this one could glide through with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The trio boarded the Supreme Malevolence Airship, and before long, they passed through the main mine and reached a vast underground chamber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here we are!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This space is spacious enough. Once we lure that Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> over, I can battle it right here to sharpen my combat skills," Tobey declared, his voice filled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then reached into his Dimensional Bag and pulled out a small vial, tossing it to Myron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Myron caught it gingerly, fully aware of what it contained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the Ultimate Soul Resonance Fluid," he said, his voice tinged with awe. It was a rare substance designed to attract high-level </span><span>Deathborns</span><span>, developed by the Artisan Institute, and incredibly expensive. Even members of the Upper Races struggled to get their hands on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Ultimate Soul Resonance Fluid was typically utilized only on the divine peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Typically, it was used only in dire situations, especially when facing a Deity King-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If one found themselves pursued by such a creature, tossing out this fluid would draw it away, allowing for a narrow escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was rumored that just a drop could be worth over a million Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Tobey was using it to lure a Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> for practice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an extravagant move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Myron thought to himself, "If only I could get my hands on some of that Ultimate Soul Resonance Fluid..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He carefully opened the vial, letting a single, shimmering drop fall to the ground in the center of the cavern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With great reverence, he returned the vial to Tobey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but notice that there </span><span>were</span><span> still at least a dozen more drops inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey pocketed the vial as if it were nothing of value, a flicker of excitement dancing in his eyes as he anticipated the arrival of the Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just wait! If there's a Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> within 300 miles, it will definitely come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It just needs a little time! I hope you two don't make me regret wasting even a drop of that Ultimate Soul Resonance Fluid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Myron and Sara quickly assured him, "Mr. Tobey Bowman, you can count on us! There's definitely a Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> around here! We swear it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey smiled, his demeanor relaxing a bit, "No need to be so tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, have you two made any progress on the investigation I asked the Royston family to conduct? Are there any leads on the Mystic Feather Clan in Wild Flame City? We need to figure out who that mysterious woman is&mdash;the one who's been challenging the geniuses from all the clans."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Myron and Sara exchanged glances, their expressions turning serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Tobey Bowman, we haven't found anything concrete yet. That mysterious woman has kept her true identity hidden, and no one seems to know who she really is. The only thing we can say for sure is that she's definitely from the Mystic Feather Clan. She appears most often around Wild Flame City. I believe she must be a hidden genius from one of the families in the Mystic Feather Clan. If we hit them hard enough, we're bound to flush her out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey's eyes narrowed with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey's expression darkened at Myron's response. "You better not let me find out who she is! If I do, I'll annihilate her entire family! Keep looking for her, no matter what.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the Mystic Feather Clan in Wild Flame City...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've heard they've been sheltering those pathetic humans. I didn't bother with them before, but now? I'll make them pay for it! I fully authorize you Demonic Dragon Clan to take action against them; no one will dare to stop you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Myron's eyes widened with excitement at Tobey's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can count on us, Mr. Tobey Bowman! We'll make sure to give the Mystic Feather Clan a serious beating and drag that mysterious woman out into the light! When the time comes, she'll be kneeling before you, begging for mercy and licking your boots!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey nodded, clearly satisfied with Myron's enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a faint red glow suddenly flickered from a token hanging around his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes lit up. "There's a massive energy surge approaching! The Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> has finally shown itself! Everyone </span><span>step</span><span> back! I'm going to face it one-on-one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Myron and Sara quickly stepped aside, nodding in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Tobey Bowman, we'll stay nearby and observe. If you need anything, just let us know. Here's to wishing you a smooth victory over that Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With an assertive nod, Tobey reached into his Dimensional Bag and pulled out a stunning long sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fearsome energy radiated from the blade, swirling like a storm of power around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the Supreme Malevolence Sword!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Myron and Sara exchanged glances, envy gleaming in their eyes at the sight of the magnificent sword. And then, at last, the Deity Overlord-level </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> emerged from the shadows of the cavern.</span></p><div class="pagination">
