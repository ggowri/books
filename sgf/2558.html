  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne is still alive?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this the Osborne who discovered the Ice Beetle's tomb and exchanged it for a large number of Kingdom Duel Scorepoints?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Rumor has it he was hunted down by a group of warriors for having too many Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, eventually losing the Kingdom Duel Badge and being killed. Isn't that right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I haven't seen him these days, I thought he was really dead!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He actually showed up."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud shout from Brenda, everyone immediately turned to look at Osborne, curious and surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had all heard of Osborne's name.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because Osborne earned too many Kingdom Duel Scorepoints in the zone duel of Eastern Zone 3, over 38 billion, breaking all previous records.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When this news spread to other zones, the participants there were all stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In their respective zones, the highest Kingdom Duel Scorepoints earned in a zone duel was only a few billion, definitely not exceeding ten billion, while Osborne achieved over 38 billion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That's truly astonishing!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Almost everyone who stood out from the zone duel remembered Osborne's name and felt jealous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, not long after, they heard another rumor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, due to having too many Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, was relentlessly hunted by numerous warriors. Not only was his Kingdom Duel Badge taken by a mysterious warrior named Lionel, but he was even killed in the battle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After arriving at Empire Hotel, they never saw Osborne, which made them even more certain the rumor was true.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, on the day the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel was about to begin, Osborne showed up again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone curiously looked at Osborne with mocking and sarcastic eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He only won the championship in Eastern Zone 3 because of luck! On the rankings, he's just in 28th place, behind Brenda from the same zone! And he's in 28th only because of the champion bonus!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In terms of strength, it's hard for him to even make the top fifty!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Exactly!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although he's still alive, his Kingdom Duel Badge and Kingdom Duel Scorepoints were taken away. How pitiful!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's so pitiful!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd murmured quietly, gloating as they watched Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy were furious and wanted to speak, but Osborne stopped them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and shook his head at them, signaling not to mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't care about these people at all. Although they were prodigies who stood out from the zone duel, Osborne had long stopped seeing them as opponents.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those nine princes and princesses of the Glorious Divine Kingdom might still spark his interest in fighting, but that would only be for revenge, driven by hatred.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't even be bothered to glance at them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He simply closed his eyes and waited patiently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Looks like we hit a sore spot, and he doesn't dare face us," someone sneered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda also said coldly, "Osborne, you only beat me because of luck! I thought you were dead and I couldn't even get my revenge! But now it seems your luck is really something, surviving even after being hunted by so many warriors!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But that's fine. You took my Ice Scepter, and I'll take it back with my own hands! On the stage of the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, I will defeat you head-on and let everyone know that I am the strongest under the Empyrean Sacredness of Eastern Zone 3!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda looked very proud.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne glanced at her lightly, his expression teasing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obviously, Brenda's teacher, Aaron, didn't tell her the truth, as Aaron was forced to swear to the Divine Principle not to reveal what happened that day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda obviously had no idea that Aaron was almost crushed to death by Adriana!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She also didn't know that Aaron, to save his life, gave his only Supreme Sacred Artifact, the Invictus Seal, to Osborne as compensation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Brenda knew this, she might not provoke Osborne again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne calmly said, "You want to defeat me in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel arena and take back your Ice Scepter? Fine! If you can withstand one move from me without losing, I'll return your Ice Scepter to you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at Brenda and sneered disdainfully.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words left Brenda stunned. Everyone around was equally surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Arrogant!" Someone beside Brenda sneered, "You think you can defeat Brenda in one move? You just got lucky winning the zone duel championship. When you face me in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, you'd better surrender and beg for mercy, or I'll teach you a harsh lesson!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This person said proudly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked at the other person and calmly asked, "Who are you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My name is Mason, ranked tenth, from East Zone One!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mason said, "Now Brenda and I have both been recruited by Prince Quinn. After the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel ends, we will join his ranks! So, Brenda and I are basically colleagues."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You got lucky in the zone duel and snatched Brenda's championship. Here, you dare to be so arrogant. I&rsquo;ll make sure to teach you a lesson!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but laugh and said, "So you're Mason, ranked tenth, the top fighter under the nine princes and princesses. Impressive!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's gaze turned icy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had no grudge against Mason, and even if Mason provoked him, Osborne couldn't be bothered to respond. In his eyes, Mason, Brenda, or anyone else was insignificant, like mice daring to challenge him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He refused to respond to them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Mason shouldn't have sided with Quinn Augustine!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quinn was the one Osborne swore to take revenge on.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne knew Quinn was very powerful, just like Weston, both strong contenders for the next king of the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their strength had likely surpassed Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne currently couldn't seek revenge on Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since Mason and Brenda had both sided with Quinn, Osborne would surely show them no mercy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those who follow Quinn must also pay the price.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said coldly, "Then I look forward to seeing you on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel stage! You and Brenda are both trash in my eyes. If you can take one move from me without losing, I'll apologize to you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne closed his eyes and ignored them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words caused everyone to burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne said what? He said he would defeat Mason in one move? Mason is the strongest fighter in this Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, aside from the nine princes and princesses!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Without the princes and princesses participating, he has a great chance of winning the championship!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even Princess Seraphina, ranked first, probably wouldn't dare claim she could defeat Mason in one move, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne is crazy!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
