  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, I'm sorry I didn't find out much information, and all I know is the number of people who signed up for each branch bloodline.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As for their power, state, and what they specialize in, I haven't gotten any information on that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nathan handed Osborne a copy of the information after he finished apologizing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled faintly, "It's okay. You've done a good job."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Saying that, Osborne quickly finished reading through the information.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The previous Branch Bloodline Competition was held five years ago. At that time, branch bloodline from Yalynch came first, followed by Marcelin in second and Ransford in third.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, Norlend was ranked fourth, Stayton fifth, Donovan sixth, Narciso seventh and Clifford in last place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the information Nathan had gotten, it recorded the number of people who had signed up for the Branch Bloodline Competition from each of the eight branch bloodlines as well as their names, ages, and other basic information.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne couldn't help but raise his eyebrows as he read it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No wonder Isaac was so pessimistic. It turns out that the difference between us and them is so huge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In the last the Branch Bloodline Competition, it was Clifford who placed last. In addition to the heir, John, there were six other participants, and all of them were under forty-five years of age and were powerful men who had reached Class A or higher.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There were even seven participants in the branch bloodline in Clifford, which was last in the ranking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In seventh place was Narciso, with nine participants, and the heir was Henry Augustine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In sixth place was Donovan, with thirteen participants, and the heir was Kent Augustine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In fifth place was Stayton, with fifteen participants, and the heir was Tony Augustine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In fourth place was Norlend, with eighteen participants, and the heir was Rodney Augustine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The top three were Yalynch, Marcelin, and Ransford, and each had twenty participants. It seemed that they had qualified more than twenty participants, and that they had negotiated to send only twenty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The heir in Yalynch is Lance, the heir in Marcelin is Sam, and the heir in Ransford is David."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne rubbed his chin, looking serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not simple."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Osborne had desperately cultivated and absorbed the star power like crazy in the past three days to enhance his body and soul, he finally made his state reach Class A+.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Class A+ wasn't exactly considered high.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne had played against Henry and John, and they had both reached Class A+, but they were just the bottom ranked heirs from branch bloodlines.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anyway, I'll do my best!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The heir test Godfather gave me was never going to be easy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne calmed down and put down the information.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, the location of the Branch Bloodline Competition has been determined to be in the Lostridge Mountains. It is a no-man's land with dense jungle and treacherous terrain. Do you need anything? We can help you prepare now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nathan looked serious. He didn't feel like he had helped Osborne, so he tried to do something for Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiles faintly, "No need. I have everything ready. Now I'm just waiting for the Branch Bloodline Competition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just wait for my good news."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they were talking, Louisa came over and told Osborne, "Mr. Augustine, the Branch Bloodline Competition is about to begin. As a participant in the competition, you need to gather with them immediately and wait for the departure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I will take you to the gathering place."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nathan asked anxiously, "Can't we go watch the fight?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Louisa smiled, "You can go to Challenge Peak and watch the fight. Except for those who participated in the Branch Bloodline Competition, all people from branch bloodlines can only watch the fight at Challenge Peak. Most of the people from main bloodlines will be the same way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nathan breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at Osborne, suddenly clenched his fists tightly, and waved them forcefully. "Osborne, go for it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isaac said, "Osborne, be careful! It won't matter if you don't get a good grade. We're already weak, so it'll be okay if we come in ninth. You're still young, so you can consider it as gaining experience this time, and you can wait until the next time to fight again. No matter what, you must come back safely!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There will be some unexpected casualties at every Branch Bloodline Competition, so you must be careful."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled faintly upon hearing that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was he just there to gain experience?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Would he wait for the next opportunity?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wasn't there to gain experience, and he couldn't wait for the next time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next Branch Bloodline Competition was five years away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's sister, Anastasia, could only live for six months at most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had to fulfill the sixth heir test as soon as possible to get Anastasia to Godfather's medical research lab in order to keep her alive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He waved his hand and walked out of the Ninth Mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Under Louisa's guidance, they soon arrived at a clearing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, there were a dozen helicopters parked in the clearing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Participants from the nine branch bloodlines of the Augustine family arrived at the site one after the other and were divided into nine small groups.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The number of people in the small groups would be greater or lesser, but Osborne was the only one who was alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He seemed like an alien.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a mocking voice suddenly rang out from Osborne's side, Osborne glanced over and realized it was the heir, John, from the branch bloodline in Clifford.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">John looked at Osborne with contempt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, are you the only one in Dampston in the Branch Bloodline Competition? Are you the losers?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In such a huge family, there aren't any other people under forty-five who can reach Class A besides you, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ha-ha-ha. That's ridiculous!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You are a disgrace to the branch bloodlines of the Augustine family!"</p><div class="pagination">
