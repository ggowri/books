  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nell stated flatly, "Umbra Earth is too dangerous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And having a dead weight along could very well get us all killed! Plus, Princess Alfreda, you promised us that any loot would be distributed evenly... So, why should we share with a useless Ascension One?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get rid of him, and we'll join your team right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Nell spoke, Pierce, Killian, and Harley couldn't help but smile, glancing over at Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's expression darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't anticipated that Nell would turn against Osborne so swiftly. Nell moved far too quickly and stealthily; before Alfreda could react, Nell's dagger was already pressed against Osborne's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clenching her fists tightly, Alfreda said with her voice dripped with icy disdain, "You want me to kick Osborne out of the team? So you four can join?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nell replied indifferently, "Exactly! This is a no-brainer for you, Princess Alfreda. If we join your exploration team, our combined strength will skyrocket! Together, we can uncover far more treasures in Umbra Earth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's face darkened further, her teeth clenched tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? What if I refuse? What if I insist on bringing Osborne with me to Umbra Earth?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, Nell furrowed her brow, sensing something was off about Alfreda's tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet she brushed it off, convinced that their power would make Alfreda reconsider.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had done their work and knew that Osborne had just arrived in Elf City the day before and had no deep ties with Alfreda to speak of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For her to cast Osborne aside for the sake of their quartet should be a piece of cake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So Nell replied coolly, "If Princess Alfreda, you truly want to drag this burden into Umbra Earth, then we can only conclude that you don't really understand what it takes to explore Umbra Earth and are just looking for a way to court disaster!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In that case, there's no way I'll join your doomed expedition!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda chuckled at that, casting a sidelong glance at the other three&mdash;Pierce from the Thunderhorn Clan, Killian from the Frost Clan, and Harley from the Undead Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked, "What about you three? Are you in the same boat as her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I insist on taking Osborne to Umbra Earth, you wouldn't want to join my team?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three exchanged glances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pierce spoke up first, his tone steady, "Nell's line of thinking aligns with mine! I trust that Princess Alfreda will heed our modest request. After all..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shot a disdainful look at Osborne, who was still under Nell's dagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's just too weak! It took little effort for Nell to subdue him! Once we're in Umbra Earth, he'd only hold us back&mdash;a complete liability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're going to Umbra Earth for treasure, not to babysit some loser! None of us want to be slowed down or risk our lives because of him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda nodded, taking it all in. "Understood! What about you two?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Killian replied coldly, "I have no desire to team up with dead weight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley added, "A loser like him doesn't deserve to walk with us! He should know better than to drag us down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda couldn't help but smile at their fervor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her grin, the four felt confident that this was a done deal. With their strength and unwavering resolve, there was no way Alfreda would turn them down over someone like Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne found himself watching Alfreda, curious about how she would respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paid little mind to Nell, who held a divine artifact dagger pressed against his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Nell was certainly formidable, boasting the power of an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King&mdash;hardly weaker than the likes of Icy Nine, Icy Eight, or Icy Seven, whom he had once defeated&mdash;he knew that any attempt on </span><span>taking </span><span>his life would be a fruitless dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had confidence that he could dodge her attack when the moment came, and perhaps even counterstrike, severely wounding or even taking her down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he held back, simply wanting to see how this would play out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, discovering that Nell's purpose was to force him out of Alfreda's exploration team ignited a fierce anger within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't been so focused on Alfreda's decisions, he might have erupted at that moment, wanting to show Nell, Pierce, Killian, and Harley just who the real dead weight was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like Princess Alfreda is on board with our proposal," Nell said with a smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, Alfreda's smile vanished, replaced by a scowl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Agree to your terms?" You think you're worth my consideration?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you lay a hand on Osborne? Don't you know he's my friend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for trouble!" she snapped, her face darkening with rage, fists trembling as if she might unleash her fury upon them right then and there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet somehow, she reined it in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you think Osborne is such a burden, you can all leave! He's definitely coming with me into Umbra Earth! As for you... you're not worthy of joining my team! Scram!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words hit Nell, Pierce, Killian, and Harley like a shockwave, their expressions turning to incredulity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never anticipated Alfreda would become so furious over Osborne, especially for someone they considered a mere liability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbelievable was the only word that could describe their reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings, each with an impressive Class A cumulative score from the Astral Testing Arch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any exploration team would bend over backward to meet their demands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here they were, being turned away for wanting Osborne, that so-called burden, to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stunned expressions crossed their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Princess Alfreda, are you sure you're in your right mind? We're Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings, and he's just a worthless Ascension One!" Nell said, her frustration boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda chuckled darkly, "Ascension Five? Impressive, huh? Let me emphasize this: you will let go of Osborne and apologize to him right now. Otherwise, don't blame me for being less than pleasant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With an icy, threatening glare, she fixed her eyes on Nell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nell's face flickered between anger and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nell thought, "She wants us to leave? And she expects me to apologize to Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That is out of the question!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clenching her teeth, she hissed, "Fine! We get the message, Princess Alfreda! Since we're not welcome here, we'll take our leave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she released Osborne and turned to walk away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could take a few steps, Alfreda's petite figure stood in her path, her voice cutting like ice. "Did you miss my point? I told you to apologize to Osborne and leave!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who gave you the right to walk away like that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Say you're sorry&mdash;now!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
