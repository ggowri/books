  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe was stunned. As an orphan, she had never imagined she might have any family. But now, Osborne was saying that his sister, Anastasia, looked exactly like her and might be her twin sister?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Zoe was overwhelmed with emotion. It was no wonder Osborne had saved her and taken her in. It all made sense now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, where is she? I want to see her!" Zoe exclaimed excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned somber, but he managed a smile and nodded. "Come on, I'll take you to see her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa hesitated for a moment before speaking, "You two go ahead. I'll take this guy to the lab first and then catch up with you." With that, she dragged Raymond away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond was about to become her test subject, and only time would tell how long he would last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne then led Zoe to Anastasia's ward. His face was filled with a mix of tenderness and sorrow when he saw his sister lying there. Anastasia had been unconscious for several months.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe saw Anastasia for the first time and was utterly shocked. She stared at the girl on the bed who looked exactly like her, only more fragile. A strange sense of connection welled up in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body trembled as she walked to the bedside, reaching out a shaky hand to gently touch Anastasia's delicate face and hair. "Sister..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The word slipped from her lips in a whisper, surprising even herself. She had no idea why she felt compelled to call Anastasia her sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But deep inside, a powerful feeling told her that the girl lying there, who looked just like her, was indeed her sister. Her blood sister that was born from the same mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia! You are my sister!" Zoe's eyes turned red instantly, and tears streamed down her face, falling onto Anastasia's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, something happened that left Osborne utterly astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, who had been in a coma for months, suddenly fluttered her eyelashes and slowly opened her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze was confused, but when she saw Zoe, her eyes lit up, and she murmured, "Sister?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! I'm your sister!" Zoe cried out, throwing herself onto Anastasia and sobbing uncontrollably. Her cries filled the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An incredible connection surged between them, making it clear that they were the closest of kin without needing any words. Their deep bond had somehow awakened Anastasia from her long slumber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was indeed a miracle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned and rushed to the bedside, exclaiming, "Anastasia, you're awake. How do you feel? You're finally awake!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's body jolted, and she turned to look at Osborne, her face softening with affection. "Osborne! I'm alive. I can see you again. I'm so happy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She struggled to lift her hand, wanting to touch Osborne's face. Despite her weakness, she gritted her teeth and kept reaching out until Osborne took her arm and placed her hand on his cheek. Only then did she smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I missed you so much," Anastasia said, her eyes welling up with tears. She kept caressing Osborne's face as if afraid this chance would never come again. Even Zoe was forgotten by her for the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's face was filled with pure affection for Osborne, and her gaze was so intense that it seemed like it might melt him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt an overwhelming sorrow as he saw the light in Anastasia's eyes fading rapidly. She was slipping back into unconsciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly said, "Anastasia, listen to me. I've found a way to save you! I won't let you die, I promise. Even if I have to fight the whole world, even if I have to give up everything, I will save you. Believe in me, just hold on, okay? When you wake up from this dream, you'll be cured. Promise me you'll hang in there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia managed a weak smile and nodded. "Okay. I promise, Osborne. I'll hold on. I want to stay with you for as long as possible. I know I can do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And my sister..." She looked at Zoe and said. "You look just like me! Although this is our first meeting, can I ask you a favor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe was stunned but nodded without hesitation. "Anastasia, just tell me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia smiled, "Take good care of Osborne for me, okay? Even if I don't make it, you stay by his side, take care of him, and help him. When he sees your face, he might think of me. That way, even if I die, I won't be too sad. Promise me, will you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe was taken aback, her eyes reddening with tears. She glanced at Osborne, then nodded vigorously, her voice choked with emotion. "Okay. I promise, Anastasia. While you're unwell, I'll take good care of Osborne for you. But you won't die. You will get better. We'll be waiting for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia finally smiled. She nodded with difficulty, casting one last loving look at Osborne before closing her eyes.</span></p><div class="pagination">
