  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are we there yet?" Osborne's voice was tinged with unease as he sensed the looming presence of the World Tree offshoot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he scanned the surroundings with his Satan's Eye, there was nothing in sight&mdash;except for a particularly fierce spatial flux in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald pointed toward the flux. "That's it! If we enter that flux and let it carry us along, we'll reach the vicinity of the World Tree's lair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, it's quite powerful. Even a Supernal Deity King at Ascension Level Six or Seven could get torn apart if they ventured in unprotected without spatial power. My actual body is entangled with that tree, so you're our only hope here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's demeanor shifted to one of seriousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flux was indeed intimidating. Even with his spatial power, he felt a natural instinct to avoid it. While he was confident that it wouldn't harm him, it was always better to steer clear of danger when he could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would've imagined that he'd need to jump into such a treacherous flux to find the World Tree's lair?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you seriously coming with me? What if I decide to abandon you in the midst of the chaos?" Osborne asked, skepticism lacing his tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald smirked, a hint of amusement in his eyes. "You can certainly try!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a chill creep down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Does he have some hidden tricks up his sleeve?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The notion gave him pause, fueling a sense of caution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wouldn't dream of it! I'll definitely need your support! Let's move!" he insisted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne enveloped both of them in his spatial energy and propelled them into the swirling current of the flux. As he felt the violent rush of energy around them, Osborne understood he needed to channel even more powerful spatial energy to withstand the force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Being in deep space is risky, even with spatial power! If these currents get a bit stronger, I could be helpless despite my abilities!" Osborne thought as he allowed the vortex to carry them away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, he noticed that the Creation Herald wore a serious expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get ready! When I count to three, I need you to unleash your spatial power at full force and break free from the flux!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we leave too early, we might miss the World Tree. But if we're late, the current could amplify its strength tenfold, and even with your spatial power, you could end up injured&mdash;if you're lucky!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We must be careful; remember, I'm here as a mere projection, but you're risking your real self! The stakes are much higher for you if something goes wrong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, his voice firm. "Don't worry; I'm not about to risk my life needlessly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Prepare yourself!" the Creation Herald commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne felt the flux's turbulent energy intensifying, it was as if they were on a calm river suddenly plunging downhill toward a waterfall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like they were on a tiny boat, heading dangerously close to the edge. They had to time their jump perfectly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaving too early meant they'd miss their destination, but leaving too late would send them tumbling off the edge to certain doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now!" the Creation Herald shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Osborne unleashed his spatial energy, feeling an overwhelming force try to drag them down into the "waterfall."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, with his space elemental essence already at Level Nine, he managed to pull off a successful escape, liberating himself and the Creation Herald from the violent chaos of the flux.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Phew! We made it!" Osborne exhaled deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was still reeling from the sudden surge of pulling force they had just escaped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald replied coolly, "Made it? Not quite yet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're now right outside the lair of that tree! From this moment on, we could be under attack at any time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, confusion etched on his face. "What do you mean?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You said the tree is entangled with your main body. We haven't even entered its lair, and it's already going to attack us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald's expression remained unfazed. "Indeed, my main body is bound to that tree. But I have ways to act independently, and so does it! Its roots serve as its extensions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"While my main body is engaged in battle, it's constantly draining energy. Therefore, some of its roots are out here in deep space, hunting to regain strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But don't worry too much; these hunting roots are mindless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They'll see us as prey, but our job is simple: evade their grasp."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the Creation Herald stepped forward. "Now, let's see what I can do!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he finished speaking, Osborne felt a wave of unease wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a massive root erupted from the void ahead, a sight all too familiar to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the very same root that had attacked him during his first visit to deep space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a terrifying, shadowy appendage that blotted out the light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as it sensed Osborne and the Creation Herald's presence, it lashed out with ferocious intent. Even now, Osborne felt a chill run down his spine, knowing he was ill-equipped to withstand such a force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha!" the Creation Herald scoffed, a hint of disdain in his voice. "Just a bunch of mindless roots thinking they can take me down?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're asking for trouble! Shatter!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, the Creation Herald unleashed a tremendous burst of power, colliding head-on with the massive root.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the next moment, Osborne's jaw dropped in shock. The Creation Herald was sent flying backward, blood spraying from every crack in his skin, his body riddled with wounds that threatened to tear him apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The colossal root, however, was also severed, twisting violently in the void as it writhed in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!" Osborne shouted, his heart racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring the blood trickling from the corner of his mouth, the Creation Herald seized Osborne by the shoulder and propelled them forward with astonishing speed, darting through the gap created by the shattered root and plunging into another spatial flux.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Creation Herald coughed up another mouthful of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quick! Use your spatial power to shield me!" he snapped at Osborne, irritation lacing his tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing the urgency of the situation, Osborne quickly summoned his spatial energy, wrapping it around them both.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald's expression softened slightly as he swallowed a white Miracle Elixir, regaining some color as the cracks on his form began to heal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remarked coldly, "That root was much weaker than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If this had happened in the past, I'd have been obliterated! But now? It can't touch me! And next up is its lair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's where you come in. You'll have to handle things from here."</span></p><div class="pagination">
