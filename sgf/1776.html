  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne surveyed the arena, and his expression was remarkably calm amidst the chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, as the various clans clashed in a battle of challenges, it seemed that every major power had sent their representatives. Thousands of Ultimate Malevolence Airships filled the skies, accompanied by dozens of Supreme Malevolence Airships.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was quite a spectacle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, most of them were merely spectators. Only a handful of truly qualified young talents from each clan were eligible to step onto the stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Osborne had made it clear that only those at the Deity King level and above could challenge them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, over a hundred young figures emerged, representing the cream of the crop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's gaze fell upon a particular individual&mdash;a man from Glory Eagle Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were sharp and menacing, radiating arrogance as he stood at the forefront of his group, clearly commanding their respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cultivation level was impressive, a peak mid-stage Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face remained impassive as he spoke, "Quite the impressive cultivation you have there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's no wonder you're so proud. We are the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, and I am Theodore Augustine, their leader!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm Vivienne Hudson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mila!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zoe Augustine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kendra Clarkson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bryce Clarkson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana Barrymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of hesitation, Hannah said, "I'm Hannah Gellar!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The eight introduced themselves, and their voices were amplified by divine power, resonating clearly in the ears of everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, the Glory Eagle Clan man sneered, saying, "Humph! Who cares about your names?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just a bunch of pathetic humans&mdash;a dying race! No one gives a damn about who you are."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laughter erupted from his companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! A bunch of worthless humans daring to challenge our young warriors? If it weren't for the ridiculous rewards you're offering, we wouldn't even bother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To me, Human Community is nothing but trash. Don't even bring up the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings. Even the former Seven Great Deity Kings were defeated by the esteemed Lord Malevolence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Human Community is destined for enslavement. Those who refuse to submit will face annihilation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right! You lowly humans don't deserve to be compared to us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young talents from various clans sneered disdainfully at Osborne and his group, and their words dripped with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The expressions of Osborne's group darkened in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce, known for his fiery temper, exploded, "Shut your mouths! Is that all you can do&mdash;talk trash? You're just a bunch of garbage! Enough with the chatter. Let's settle this in the arena! I'll smash your mouths into pieces!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm the weakest among the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings! I'll fight first! Who among you dares to challenge me? No holds barred!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce's furious declaration and scornful gaze were met with fury from the assembled warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you calling garbage?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch your mouth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pathetic Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young warriors from various clans erupted in anger, but Bryce stood his ground, firing back with equal ferocity. The tension escalated until Osborne let out a cold snort, causing the surrounding space to tremble. The warriors felt as if a massive weight had settled upon them, and their expressions shifted to one of shock as they struggled to muster their divine power to resist, silencing their insults.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, and his tone was unyielding, "Had enough of the insults? If you're done talking, let's take it to the arena and see who comes out on top!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he retracted his spatial energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young warriors from the various clans regained their composure, though their faces were now grave, casting wary glances at Osborne, and their expressions were serious. At that moment, the man from Glory Eagle Clan broke the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph! Powerful spatial power! Spatial clones haven't been seen on Celestara in ages!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Theodore, aren't you? You're making me curious now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings aren't all washed up after all. I'll have to give it a shot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But before we start the arena battle, should we see the rewards first? At least let us know if you can actually deliver those prizes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You mentioned that the Supreme Malevolence Sword and Shield, ten thousand Celestial Crystals, and five Miracle Elixirs are up for grabs if we defeat you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I highly doubt you can come up with all that. If you can't, this battle has no point! And if you try to mess with us, we won't hesitate to swarm and take you down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ambrose's eyes flickered with malice as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne merely chuckled, "Just rewards, huh? If you want to see them, have a look!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his hand, Osborne summoned ten thousand Celestial Crystals and five Miracle Elixirs to the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dazzling light of the crystals and the ethereal glow of the elixirs instantly captured everyone's attention. Rumors buzzed through the crowd, and suddenly, even the most seasoned fighters felt their breath quicken, and their eyes flashed with greed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten thousand Celestial Crystals? That's real!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five Miracle Elixirs? Incredible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Celestial Crystals and Miracle Elixirs are hard to come by, even for us. How do these lowly members of Human Community have so much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
