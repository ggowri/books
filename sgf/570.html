  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Branch Bloodline Competition has officially come to a close!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb announced, his gaze sweeping over Lance and Osborne with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My decision was accurate. In the end, it is you two who shine, destined to become the heirs of the Augustine family. Well done!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Pausing, he fixed his eyes on Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a broad smile, Caleb said, "Osborne, I've witnessed your performance. You've excelled beyond expectations. Against all odds, you've vanquished your rivals and secured the Heir's Emblem. It's a feat most rare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I harbor great hopes that, as the prospective heir of the Augustine family, you will continue to strive. Soon, the true heir selection will commence. I anticipate your emergence among the top three. As a member of the branch bloodline, you could very well become one of the Augustine family's top three heirs."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne only offered a faint smile in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Caleb Augustine, you flatter me. It was mere luck. In the next heir selection for Augustine family, I am but a contender."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb looked surprised. "Truly? Is that what you genuinely believe?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Inwardly, Osborne felt a twinge of helplessness. His true aim was to become the Augustine family's first heir after surpassing Vincent, Matthew, and all other contenders in the heir selection until claiming the top spot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, Osborne could not voice these ambitions; he wished to maintain a low profile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Osborne sensed that Caleb seemed intent on thrusting him into the limelight, making him a target to deny him any respite.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now was the example.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb's words, though seemingly laudatory, were, in fact, stoking enmity. Not far off, Lance looked furious and fixed his eyes on Osborne in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne had no choice but to feign humility. "I'm already content to be the quasi-heir. Luck played a significant role. I'm contemplating whether to participate in the next heir selection. If it proves too perilous, I may opt to withdraw."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb studied Osborne with a knowing smile, attempting to peer into his thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne maintained a serene facade, allowing the scrutiny.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb chuckled and nodded. "It's commendable that you hold such views. The truth is, you have little chance in the upcoming heir selection. After all, it's not solely a test of personal strength and cunning but also of the might behind you, your resources, and your network of allies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In summary, you hold almost no advantage."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne felt a pang of frustration at these words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "Seeing flattery ineffective, Caleb was now resorting to disparagement, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why could he not speak plainly?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, Osborne gleaned valuable insights from Caleb's words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Augustine family's heir selection was imminent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only six prospective heirs were eligible to compete, and victory was not guaranteed to the strongest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They would also be judged by the power they wielded and the breadth of their alliances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This realization weighed heavily on Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, I shall say no more. Despite the unfavorable circumstances, I hold you in high regard. I believe in your potential for miracles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The other five heirs-to-be should be vigilant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb's smile only served to amplify the animosity directed at Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne rolled his eyes in silent exasperation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was now certain that Caleb was deliberately stirring trouble, attempting to elevate him. If Caleb's words were to spread, the other heirs would undoubtedly view Osborne with greater suspicion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With no advantage to begin with, the difficulty of completing the sixth succession trial for Osborne had just skyrocketed, which irritated him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Enough said. Hand over your emblems."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb wasted no further words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lance and Osborne promptly presented their emblems. With a wave of his hand and a tap on the emblems, Caleb returned them to their respective owners.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now, these are truly yours!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wear these emblems with pride. You are now the heirs-to-be of both the main and branch bloodlines of the Augustine family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Return and prepare diligently. The selection for the Augustine family's successor is on the horizon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Perhaps, it follows the Godfather's birthday celebration."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With these words, Osborne and Lance turned solemn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The selection for the Augustine family's successor was the true test of their mettle!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If they failed, their status as quasi-heirs would be forfeited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two donned their emblems and followed Caleb onto the helicopter, bound for the Augustine Estate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, the rankings of the Branch Bloodline Competition had been finalized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">First place: Dampston.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Second place: Yalynch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Third place: Marcelin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fourth place: Ransford.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fifth place: Norlend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ninth place: Clifford.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this competition, aside from Dampston's unexpected rise to the top, the rankings of the other branches remained unchanged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All branch bloodlines had merely shifted down one position.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Caleb announced that the branch bloodline from Dampston had secured first place, Lance's face contorted with rage. His eyes were betraying his unwillingness to accept this outcome.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Caleb Augustine, why does Dampston claim first place instead of Yalynch?" Lance protested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Caleb replied evenly, "Because Osborne eliminated the most opponents. Because every contestant from Dampston persevered until the end. However, the contestants from Yalynch, save for you, were vanquished by Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If not Osborne, then who deserves the top spot?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lance retorted, "That's only due to the rules preventing me from attacking him! Otherwise, I could have easily disposed of him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How can the branch bloodline from Dampston compare to Yalynch?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dampston is the weakest among the Augustine family's nine branch bloodlines. If we allow them to be the top-ranked branch, won't our Augustine family become a laughingstock?"</p><div class="pagination">
