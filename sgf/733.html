  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The strongest in the world!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned. "Are you saying he held an Honor Quest Ceremony more than two hundred years ago? And you think he might still be alive? Are you saying he's lived for over two hundred years?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He hasn't appeared publicly for a long time, but his rank still exists on the global Quasi-Divine Rankings, so we can only speculate that he might still be alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe only those like Godfather, who have a name on the global Quasi-Divine Rankings, know whether Helios is truly alive or not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised his eyebrows again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is this global Quasi-Divine Rankings?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma sighed in exasperation, "How do you know nothing? How have you reached your current level without knowing any of this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne awkwardly scratched his nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had only been training for a few months and had only recently entered the world of metahumans, so it made sense that he wouldn't know these things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He did know about the Forbes Rich List, though.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he now understood that truly wealthy people never appeared on the Forbes list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, tell me, what exactly is the global Quasi-Divine Rankings?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can think of the global Quasi-Divine Rankings as a ranking of all Class S Supreme Overlords. But not every Class S Supreme Overlord qualifies to be on it. Only the top one hundred can make it onto the global Quasi-Divine Rankings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They are known as the ones closest to divinity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This list is managed by the Diviner League, so no one doubts its fairness. Everyone on it is one of the world's top warriors."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Like Helios, Godfather, or the King of the Aberrants."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne asked curiously, "Then where do Godfather and the King of the Aberrants rank on the global Quasi-Divine Rankings?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma hesitated for a moment but eventually told him, "At his peak, Godfather was ranked fifty-first on the global Quasi-Divine Rankings. Now, he has fallen to seventy-fifth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the King of the Aberrants, he was once ranked eightieth, but he has since risen to sixtieth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather is only ranked seventy-fifth, but the King of the Aberrants is sixtieth? Does that mean the Diviner League considers the King of the Aberrants to be stronger than Godfather now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Though I hate to admit it, that's the Diviner League's assessment. And they're rarely wrong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face turned serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected that Godfather, considered a legend in Rosmandi, would only rank seventy-fifth on the global Quasi-Divine Rankings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That meant there were at least seventy-four people worldwide stronger than Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that was just what he could know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the shadows, there could be even more powerful individuals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath. For the first time, he felt the vastness of the world. He realized that he had been a frog at the bottom of a well, never truly understanding the world's reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get back to the topic of the Honor Quest Ceremony."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma brought the conversation back, speaking seriously. "Ever since Helios successfully held his Honor Quest Ceremony, rose rapidly, and reached the top of the global Quasi-Divine Rankings, many have believed that his incredible strength was forged by enduring the challenges of all the warriors of his generation during his Honor Quest Ceremony, defeating them all, and thereby cultivating his invincible spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As a result, others began to imitate Helios and hold Honor Quest Ceremonies. Divine Families and Ancient Families around the world would hold Honor Quest Ceremonies after appointing their heirs, inviting the world's young elites to participate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But they soon encountered setbacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hundreds have tried to hold an Honor Quest Ceremony, but none have fully succeeded! The world is vast, and there are many warriors. Being a genius is just the starting point for becoming a warrior, and being the best among geniuses is merely the threshold for participating in an Honor Quest Ceremony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In every Honor Quest Ceremony, the host faces dozens, even hundreds, of top global talents as challengers! The challenged have little time to rest or recover, so facing continuous opponents, they almost always end up defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In over two hundred years, of the nearly one thousand people who have attempted to hold an Honor Quest Ceremony, only sixty-three have managed to defeat over fifty opponents! Only nine have defeated one hundred opponents, and only three in history have ever perfectly completed an Honor Quest Ceremony, fighting until no one dared challenge them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And those three are now among the top ten warriors on the global Quasi-Divine Rankings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our Augustine family has held six Honor Quest Ceremonies over the past two hundred years. The last host was Godfather. In his Honor Quest Ceremony, Godfather defeated ninety-five challengers, just five short of surpassing one hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But in the end, even Godfather failed."</span></p><div class="pagination">
