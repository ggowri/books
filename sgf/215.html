  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, could you take a look at this ancient sword for me? I feel like there's something off about it, like I can't fully unleash its power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne handed the inheritance sword of the Chevalier family to Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa took the sword, casually inspected it, and then handed it back to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa explained, "Of course, you can't fully unleash its power. It's the inheritance sword of the Chevalier family, passed down through generations with a special ritual. It carries the essence of the Chevalier family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only descendants of the Chevalier family can fully wield its power. Being able to harness thirty percent of its power is already impressive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a bit frustrated upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there no way to solve this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The inheritance sword was incredibly powerful, surpassing any technological weapon, even the Draco Group's Class A alloy dagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Osborne always felt uncomfortable using it, unable to fully unleash its potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled, "There is a way. You just need to erase the Chevalier family's essence on it and infuse it with your own. Then, it will be as easy as pie for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know how to do it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa shrugged. "What's so difficult about it? It's just a level one ancient magic weapon. Erasing the essence is a piece of cake for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled. "Isa, then I'll trouble you with that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No trouble at all, for 100 million dollars," Isa calmly stated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was shocked. "100 million? You said it was a piece of cake. Are you charging me for this, even with our relationship?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa looked at Osborne, teasingly smiling, "To me, it's a simple task. But for those who don't understand, it's impossible. 100 million from you is a bargain. If it were someone else, I wouldn't even lift a finger for a billion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what relationship do we have? You just kissed me forcibly once and now you think of me as your woman? Haha, you've got quite the imagination!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was left speechless, his mouth agape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why bring up the kiss again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, that was my first kiss! You kissed me, and if I didn't castrate you, it would be a miracle. You still want me to work for you for free? Dream on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I asked you for 100 million back then, saying you could ask me to do anything, you refused. That chance was a one-time offer. Now, even if you offer me 10 billion, forget it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, he compromised. "Alright, alright, I'll give you 100 million. Is that okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled upon hearing this, "That'll do! Transfer the funds, and once it's in, I'll take care of it in no time. Though it's just a level one ancient magic weapon, it could fetch several billions at an auction."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne transferred the money to Isa and curiously asked, "Level one ancient magic weapon? Do these artifacts have different levels?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa replied as she operated the sword, "Of course they do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ancient magic weapons are created through a special ritual, requiring generations to consecrate it with their spirit, will, and power, shaping its unique abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The method of consecration and the strength of the one who baptizes it affect the artifact's power. Based on their power, ancient magic weapons are classified into levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The higher the level, the more terrifying the power. The most powerful ancient magic weapon can make their wielder godlike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even the weakest level one ancient magic weapons is stronger than the Draco Group's most powerful Class A technological weapons. Only ancient families possess these artifacts, and they are extremely rare and precious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne felt as if his horizons had been significantly broadened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, he had indeed been like a frog at the bottom of a well, living in the ordinary world, passing through life in a simple and unremarkable manner, never coming into contact with these extraordinary matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about divine artifacts?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought of Cain's Blood Cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine artifacts?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was taken aback for a moment, saying, "Divine artifacts are unable to be manufactured; it is said that all divine artifacts are naturally formed. Some say they are divine weapons crafted by gods, and mortals can't fully utilize their powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine artifacts are much rarer than ancient magic weapons, but their power is more formidable and terrifying. Each ancient artifact is unique, a once-in-a-lifetime find.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know why Godfather has become the ruler of the underworld in Rosmandi?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was surprised, saying, "Could it be that Godfather possesses a divine artifact?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded. "You're very clever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right. Godfather can become the ruler of the underworld not only because of his extraordinary strength but also because he wields a divine artifact. As for what it is, I have no idea. It's said to be extremely terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, stop thinking about divine artifacts. They're not something you should covet. Even if you obtained one, you wouldn't be able to keep it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright. It's done. Give it a try and see how it feels."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa handed the ancient sword to Osborne after speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took it and immediately felt the uncomfortable sensation disappear. The sword seemed to have become an extension of his arm, perfectly in tune with his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the vast power within the ancient sword, Osborne was delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This 100 million is money well spent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, you'll be known as the Death's Edge. Let's see what kind of power you possess."</span></p><div class="pagination">
