  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the battle began, everyone knew that the border competition between the Human Community and the Unity Clan was going to be brutal. People would die on the arena, no doubt about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they were all wrong about one thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one expected the competition to be this savage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't just a fight&mdash;it was a bloodbath, a battle to the death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a war for the honor and survival of entire races. There was only one way to win: wipe out every single enemy. And there was only one way to lose: fall on that arena and stay there, unable to move, until your last breath left your body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom! Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though only 20,000 Transcendent Deities were fighting here&mdash;tiny compared to the hundreds of billions in both armies&mdash;it was still a massacre. These 20,000 were practically cannon fodder on the grand stage of the war, and to the high-ranking figures watching, they were nothing more than ants. Their power, compared to the true powerhouses, seemed laughably weak, like kids throwing punches in a schoolyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when the battle actually kicked off, the air grew heavy with tension. Every face in the crowd darkened, and every eye locked onto the fighters, feeling the raw determination coming off the warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The screams, the roars, the blood...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was impossible not to clench your fists as you watched them either explode their enemies or have their own bodies shattered into pieces. The brutality of it all weighed down on every single spectator, a heavy, uncomfortable pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Imagine this fight, but ten thousand times bigger," one observer muttered. "The final showdown between the Human Community and the Unity Clan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brutal. Bloody."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all or nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom! Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the hundreds of billions in armies watching from the sidelines fell completely silent. Every eye was fixed on the viewing platform above, where a mere 20,000 warriors were fighting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And those 20,000 were rapidly dwindling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty thousand...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eighteen thousand...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fifteen thousand...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten thousand...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five thousand...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three thousand...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The viewing platform, spanning 300 miles, was more than large enough to accommodate the battle. At first, the two sides fought in clusters, but as more warriors fell, the chaos escalated. Every corner of the platform was erupting in bloody skirmishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One Human Community genius, drenched in blood, rammed his longsword deep into an enemy's chest, only to have his head severed by another enemy the very next second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of Unity Clan elites surrounded a dozen or so Human Community geniuses. Then, in an instant, the Human Community fighters chose to self-destruct, taking everyone with them in a fiery explosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom! Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood, severed limbs, heads, shattered weapons...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chaos flooded the viewing platform. Amid the roar of the battle, the fighting slowly died down. When the dust settled, fewer than 2,000 remained standing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest, nearly 18,000 warriors, were either lifeless or reduced to unrecognizable piles of ash and bone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And those 2,000 standing tall? Every single one of them was covered in blood, their bodies torn apart...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all Unity Clan elites.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, the Human Community's 10,000 Transcendent Deity geniuses had wiped out over 8,000 Unity Clan fighters&mdash;but at the cost of their entire army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Community had lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, in that moment, even the Dark Deity Legion of Unity Clan didn't cheer. They stood there, staring at the blood-soaked silhouettes of the surviving warriors on the viewing platform, their faces filled with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle between Transcendent Deities could be this intense?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before it ended, no one had dared to assume that Unity Clan would come out on top. Even after the battle was over, with the outcome clear, the Dark Deity Legion didn't celebrate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because it had been too horrific. Too brutal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they were soldiers, warriors who had fought in countless battles, most of the time, when two forces collided, it was all about getting in a few good hits and retreating if things got too rough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, on this viewing platform, only 300 miles across, there was no retreat. No one was surrendering. No one was backing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only thing on their minds was eliminating the enemy&mdash;by any means necessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if it meant biting through their own teeth. Even if it meant self-detonation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We lost the first round..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leaders of the Sanctum of Light's factions stood in stunned silence, their faces heavy with grief. Most of the Human Community warriors who had died on that platform came from their own ranks&mdash;many were their own children, nieces, nephews, and younger generations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they were all gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they hadn't brought shame to the Human Community. They fought until the bitter end, and they had a real shot at victory...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet now, all of them were dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first border competition for the Human Community... lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And for Unity Clan? It was a hollow victory. A brutal, bloody win that didn't feel like winning at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, everyone felt like their throats had closed up, their eyes starting to burn with a red haze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew that losing 10,000 Transcendent Deities wasn't the end of the world. It wasn't even that big of a deal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a thousand years, they had faced losses a hundred times, even a thousand times worse, just trying to hold their ground against the Dark Deity Legion. They'd seen unimaginable horrors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time... this time was different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, they watched with their own eyes as the 10,000 Human Community Transcendent Deities, despite pushing themselves to the absolute limit, still lost. Lost the battle. Lost their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every leader stood with a grave expression. Sure, it was just one battle, but from this one battle, it was clear: the gap between the Human Community and Unity Clan wasn't just theoretical&mdash;it was real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And what made it worse?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unity Clan hadn't even unleashed their full power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>None of the geniuses from the Paramount Supreme Clans had been deployed. In fact, even among the Upper Race, the number of elites sent to fight had been shockingly low.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, despite all that, the Human Community still lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the battle, the leaders of the various factions had been full of confidence, but now, they couldn't even muster the strength to speak. They just stood there, in heavy silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>God of Light</span><span>, your Human Community just lost the first round," Icy One's voice rang out, cold and mocking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled. "Your warriors have courage, I'll give you that. Too bad they're lacking a bit in the power department. I didn't even need to send my real geniuses from the Dark Deity Legion, and we still wiped the floor with you. According to the rules, for every round you lose, your defenses have to fall back by a million kilometers. So, we've only lost 8,000 Transcendent Deities, but we're pushing forward a million kilometers. Seems like a pretty good trade, don't you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The taunting words sent a wave of fury through every Human Community member.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light</span><span>'s lips curled into a tight sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Icy One, don't get too cocky," she shot back, her voice ice-cold. "This is just the beginning. The fight isn't over yet, and who wins and who loses is still up in the air. By the end of the day, maybe you will be the ones retreating!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha ha ha!" Icy One let out a loud, mocking laugh. "Really? If you think your Human Community has what it takes, then prove it! You want us to fall back? You think you can make that happen? You lowly Human Community scum, do you really think you stand a chance? You better hope you don't lose all eight of today's matches. If that happens, I'll be laughing my ass off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the Dark Deity Legion finally snapped out of their stunned silence, erupting into cruel, mocking laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha ha ha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha ha ha ha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pathetic Human Community, is that all your so-called geniuses are capable of? Don't embarrass yourselves any more than you already have! You actually think you're worthy of challenging us? You're just signing your own death warrant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, we're pushing forward eight million kilometers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right, we'll win all eight rounds!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their fierce shouts made every Human Community warrior's face darken. But there was nothing they could say in response; after all, they had lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough talk!" </span><span>God of Light</span><span> snapped. "Let's get back to it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next round&mdash;Celestial Deity level match!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's begin!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
