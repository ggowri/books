  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade stared at Isaac with cold eyes, and countless tiny lightning flashes appeared and disappeared in the void, making crackles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It looked terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac was sullen. Wade didn't investigate carefully but immediately suspected that he did it, which angered Isaac. He also stared at Wade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Wade, why do you think someone from my family did it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade snorted coldly, "Brad brought Yohan and Lauren to the Augustine Estate, but the two were killed not long after they left. You know very well what they went there for. If I'm not mistaken, Brad must have angered you, so you killed them, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac couldn't help laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said calmly, "You are right. Brad angered me. They actually came to my place to show off and forced me to hand over the heir of my family to him. I wanted to kill him, but I still let them go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for who killed them after they left, it has nothing to do with me. I'm a fire elemental controlling metahuman. Take a look at Yohan and Lauren's bodies and check if there are any residual fire elemental on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look around. Is there any smell of fire elemental?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Isaac finished speaking, Wade was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where's Brad?" Wade looked at Shawn and winked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn said, "When I got here, I didn't see Brad. Only Yohan and Lauren's bodies are left there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade asked, "Didn't you see Brad's body?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn shook his head. "No. I don't think Brad is dead. I sensed the fluctuations of the battle from afar. It was very intense. I guess two Class A martial masters were fighting there, and one of them must be Brad. Although he was at a disadvantage, he would not die easily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade frowned upon hearing this, "Are you sure it's two martial masters fighting?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn hesitated for a moment. He really wanted to ascribe the cause to Isaac or Emery, but he knew that there would be too many loopholes in doing so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was not the only one who had sensed the fluctuations of the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, as long as Wade checked the traces of the battle around, he could confirm that they were not left by Isaac.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn could only nod. "Maybe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade frowned deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Could it be that it really wasn't done by the Augustine family but some mysterious forces that wanted to deal with the Paltrow family? Nothing has gone well for my family during this period."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade was a little annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ghost Ship that Paltrow family had secretly built for two hundred years had been recently destroyed by a mysterious force. He investigated it but found no clues at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had suspected the Augustine family. With its strength, if they wanted to destroy the Ghost Ship, Isaac had to take action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the intelligence showed that Isaac had not left the Augustine Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, something happened to Brad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade automatically suspected the Augustine family, but the battle traces showed no marks of the fire elemental.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Based on his understanding of the Augustine family...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from Isaac, no one in the Augustine family could kill Yohan and Lauren under the protection of Brad, a Class A martial master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade thought, "So, does it really not relate to the Augustine family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who is secretly targeting the Paltrow family? I'll definitely kill the murderer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade suppressed his fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What annoyed him the most was that Brad was dead, too. Although there was no body of Brad, Wade knew that Brad was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad had a life detection system on his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, the system suddenly reported to the Paltrow family that Brad's vital signs were rapidly weakening and then disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, only Wade knew that Brad was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clenched his fists in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad was a Class A martial master. Although the Paltrow family was powerful, they only had two Class A Power Masters and three Class A martial masters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad's death was a heavy blow to the Paltrow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would probably even affect the following plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Wade was in a rage. He wanted to accuse the Augustine family directly and then take the opportunity to destroy it under the banner of revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in the end, he calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other prominent ancient families were not stupid. If Wade dared to do this, perhaps no one would help the Augustine family, but the other families would definitely be more vigilant against the Paltrow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this period, there were rumors that the Paltrow, Walker, and Luther families had formed a three-power alliance to deal with the other six ancient families in Dampston to take the lead in Dampston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no evidence, and several ancient families obviously did not believe such rumors, but they might have already been on guard against the three families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade even felt that someone was keeping an eye on the three families as if looking for evidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Damn! Who is secretly leaking the news? How did they know about the alliance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more he thought about it, the more solemn he became.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wade said coldly, "Investigate it thoroughly. I swear I will wipe out the person's family if I find out who did it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go!" He didn't want to stay here any longer, so he left some of his men to investigate and prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a young man who wore a hat behind Wade stepped forward and stopped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man said calmly, "Wade, I have some things to deal with."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, he took off his hat, revealing a feminine face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On his forehead, there was a strange lightning symbol, which was flickering slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was Alexander.</span></p><div class="pagination">
