  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that Reginald killed my twin brother?" Osborne pondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, as he delved deeper into Reginald's memories, he found no answers&mdash;only more questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He forced himself to calm down and continued to sift through the fragments of Reginald's past. The memories revealed a dark tale of his parents being taken to the Pantheon League, where they endured horrific torture. The vivid images of their suffering brought tears to Osborne's eyes, igniting a fire of rage within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was just a glimpse of the torment Reginald had inflicted; there were far worse horrors he hadn't witnessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, Osborne saw the moment his parents seized an opportunity to escape, only to be swallowed by a sudden black vortex, disappearing forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reginald hadn't been there to witness it&mdash;he had only heard rumors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, he couldn't be sure if Osborne's parents were truly alive or dead, nor could he identify the location of that mysterious vortex. With their disappearance, Reginald had moved on, never looking back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scoured every inch of Reginald's memories but found no further information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How's it going, Osborne?" Sebastian asked, noticing the storm brewing on Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With clenched jaws, Osborne replied, "I saw them! I saw my parents in Reginald's memories! I even witnessed Reginald kill one of their children."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He locked eyes with Sebastian; urgency etched on his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, do I have other twin brothers? Who did Reginald kill?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's expression shifted to one of shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Reginald killed one of their children? That can't be! You're standing right here, alive and well! And most importantly, you can't have a twin! Your mother went through countless tests while pregnant, and they confirmed without a doubt that she was only carrying you. So, you don't have a twin brother!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a jolt of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "No twin brother?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, who was the child Reginald killed? That kid had the same birthmark on his neck as me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My parents looked at him with so much love and affection; he had to be their biological child!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, if that child was me, how am I here now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His thoughts spiraled into confusion, and Osborne shook his head vigorously, desperate to make sense of it all. The only way to find clarity was to locate his parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to do that, he needed to track down the black vortex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured to himself, "Where is that black vortex?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Reginald's memories barely scratch the surface. There's no clear description, no location. The only way to find answers is to go to the Pantheon League and track down someone who actually saw my parents fall into that vortex... I have to find the Pantheon League!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glint of cold determination flashed in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, I'm gearing up to confront the Pantheon League! I need to know what happened to my parents and whether they're still alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian furrowed his brows deeply as he spoke. "I know you're bound to confront the Pantheon League, even without the issue of your parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But taking them on isn't going to be a walk in the park. For some time now, the Pantheon League has seemed to vanish. My guess is that they know we won't let them off the hook, so they've gone into hiding."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scoffed, a smirk creeping onto his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hiding? Just because others can't find the Pantheon League doesn't mean I can't! No matter where they're holed up, I'll track them down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confidence radiated from Osborne as he pieced together the puzzle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that the members of the Pantheon League must have all retreated into the Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had witnessed it with his own eyes&mdash;the enigmatic realm of the Pantheon League, and he had left behind a residue of spatial energy on its vessel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter where they tried to hide it, he could follow that energy trail directly to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fierce hatred burned in Osborne's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Memories of his parents being tortured by the Pantheon League flashed through his mind, igniting an uncontainable fury. He was ready to storm the Pantheon League's Dimensional Microcosm and wipe them all out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through gritted teeth, he said, "Grandpa, I'm setting off for the Pantheon League right now! Rest assured, they've taken my parents and tormented them, and I won't let them get away with it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as my parents are alive, I will bring them back! I also need to find out who that child was that Reginald killed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without further ado, Osborne prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he planned to go solo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the rule-incomplete Blue Planet, the highest anyone could ascend was to the Transcendent Deity level. Given Osborne's current power, slaying a Transcendent Deity was a piece of cake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saw no one who could pose a threat to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if the Pantheon League had a battalion of Transcendent Deities, he wouldn't flinch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his decision made, Osborne urged everyone to continue their training and left the Augustine Bastion.</span></p><div class="pagination">
