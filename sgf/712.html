  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't collapse; he knew the battle wasn't over yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now was not the time to lose consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Struggling to his feet, he checked on Emma and sighed in relief when he saw she had merely fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly scooped her up and laid her gently beside the others&mdash;Donna, Barlyn, Dylan, and Eugen&mdash;who were also sprawled unconscious on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Emma safely placed, Osborne turned his attention to the distant battlefield where Clarissa and Luca were locked in combat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca was clearly ramping up his assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fatebearer, it seems you really can't pull off that trick, Retribution for Fate, again! With that in mind, it's time for you to meet your end!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After wasting so much time, I'm ready to finish this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Luca swung his divine artifact, a massive axe, unleashing a terrifying force aimed straight at Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa raised her Divine and Demonic Wings to defend herself, but they were already battered from the prolonged fight. With a resounding crash, the wings shattered under Luca's onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer force struck Clarissa directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She coughed up blood, her face paling in an instant as the pain coursed through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca grinned, a chilling smile spreading across his face. "Just give up! You're the Fatebearer, so I won't kill you, but you have to come with me to meet the great King of the Aberrants!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dragging his massive axe, he advanced toward Clarissa with a playful smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa bit her lip, defiance burning in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think I'll surrender? You're not worthy of that! I haven't lost yet; we're still fighting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she suddenly stowed away the Fate Staff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In its place, a gigantic harpoon appeared in her hands, and as it manifested, the surrounding waters erupted into massive waves. The scent of blood drew sharks from the depths, and they quickly turned tail and fled in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Trident of Poseidon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca's eyes widened in surprise as he took in the sight of the Trident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Trident of Poseidon? How did you get that? It was supposed to be with Bryce of Likreia Mountain!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A serious expression crossed his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa shot him a cold glare. "What does that matter to you? Let's keep fighting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce grip on the Trident of Poseidon, she lunged at Luca, thrusting it forward with all her might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ocean trembled as an invisible force surged through the Trident, transforming her seemingly casual jab into a terrifying attack. A massive waterspout formed, spiraling toward Luca like a sea dragon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca's expression shifted to one of alarm as he swung his axe to intercept.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The axe collided with the waterspout, creating a thunderous sound that echoed across the battlefield. Luca was sent flying, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa, however, felt her own strength waning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca laughed. "Hahaha!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Trident of Poseidon? It truly lives up to its name! As long as we're at sea, its power rivals that of any top-tier divine artifact!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you can't wield it to its full potential! In your hands, the Trident can't unleash its true power! Otherwise, I'd be a goner right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca wiped the blood from his mouth and charged back into the fray, a mocking smile on his face. "Fatebearer, how many more times can you swing that Trident? Bring it on! Once you're out of juice, it'll be my turn to capture you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's expression darkened at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Luca had pointed out, her mastery of the Trident of Poseidon was lacking; it felt almost as if it were resisting her. She couldn't tap into its full strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, that recent strike, even if it hadn't been fatal to Luca, would have severely injured him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As it stood, she could manage to use the Trident of Poseidon for one more attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if that failed to take Luca down, Clarissa would be left drained and unable to retaliate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa bit her lip, torn with uncertainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that moment, she felt a faint ripple in the fabric of space behind her. A figure emerged slowly from a dimensional rift. It was Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He placed a hand on Clarissa's shoulder and spoke calmly, "Clarissa, leave the rest to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa turned around in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you won? But you're so badly injured!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Osborne's battered state, Clarissa frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, she cast divine healing on him, her magic instantly mending much of his grievous wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca, observing the scene, looked grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So you're still alive? Hmph! Even with Palmers controlling the Dark Realm, she failed to kill you? And those half-baked clones are useless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luca's eyes burned with murderous rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a pity that even if they're all dead, as long as I'm here, none of you will escape!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All of you will die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne stepped in front of Clarissa, grabbing hold of the massive Trident of Poseidon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He offered a faint smile. "Is that so? Because I have a feeling the one who will die today is you. Let's fight!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
