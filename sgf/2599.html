  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The terrifying power engulfed the entire arena. Everyone wanted to know who won.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But soon, everyone's expressions changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Above the arena, one figure stood tall like a straight spear, while the other figure sat collapsed on the arena, near the edge, almost falling off.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the one standing tall was Osborne, while the one sitting was Seraphina, blood continuously dripping from the corner of her mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, a loud uproar erupted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne won?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Princess Seraphina actually lost?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the spectators exclaimed in shock. Meanwhile, the area where the Royal Family members were seated was utterly silent, and every Royal Family member's face was extremely grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They angrily stared at Osborne and Seraphina.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina lost? Then, who can stop Osborne? Osborne will easily win the championship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Osborne calmly said, "Princess Seraphina, stand up. I know you haven't lost yet. I know you still have a trump card."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, the surroundings instantly fell silent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone looked at Osborne in surprise, then turned to Seraphina.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What did Osborne say?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina hasn't lost? Seraphina still has a trump card? How is that possible? She already unleashed the seventh arrow of her most powerful Twinkling Star Arrow. Yet, not only did she fail to seriously injure and defeat Osborne, but she also ended up with significant injuries herself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In such a situation, everyone believed Seraphina had already lost.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne, Seraphina's opponent, said she still had a trump card.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What trump card does she have?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, even the members of the Royal Family were puzzled. They also thought Seraphina had already given her all and couldn't possibly have a trump card left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Seraphina slowly stood up. She wiped the blood from the corner of her mouth with the back of her hand, her eyes showing no defeat, only coldness and anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The energy in her body erupted even more violently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation instantly filled the members of the Royal Family with great surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Has Seraphina really not lost yet? Does she truly have a trump card?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Seraphina coldly said to Osborne, "How did you find out? How did you know I still had a trump card?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile but didn't answer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, he hadn't realized it before and did believe that the seventh arrow of the Twinkling Star Arrow was Seraphina's strongest move.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Seraphina was injured, Osborne also thought he had already won.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that moment, his Satan's Eye noticed something was off.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Inside Seraphina, another force erupted, quickly merging with her Sacred Power before swiftly separating again. Then, Seraphina pretended to be seriously injured, sitting there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one else noticed the change in her energy at that moment, but Osborne saw it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Sacred Power within Seraphina wasn't formed by the fusion of three forces but by four.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Like Osborne, Seraphina had also been hiding her strength. She had actually fused with the fourth force long ago but never revealed it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn&rsquo;t explain and simply said, &ldquo;No matter what cards you have, you&rsquo;ll lose today.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Seraphina couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh and say, &ldquo;Oh? Even though you guessed I have a trump card, I&rsquo;m sure you have no idea what it is. No one can guess. I didn&rsquo;t plan on revealing it.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;But now, for my dignity, for the glory of the Glorious Divine Kingdom's Royal Family, to defeat you, and to prove that I am the strongest among those who haven&rsquo;t reached Empyrean Sacredness, I have no choice but to reveal my trump card.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, the energy within Seraphina erupted like a volcano, and the fluctuations of her Sacred Power became even more terrifying in that instant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The incredibly terrifying Sacred Power swirled around Seraphina, instantly freezing everyone watching in place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, even Frederick became extremely excited and rarely praised, &ldquo;She fused four types of power? Good! Very good!&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, everyone was utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;What? Princess Seraphina&rsquo;s Sacred Power fused four types of power? She hasn&rsquo;t even reached Empyrean Sacredness. Before reaching Empyrean Sacredness, isn&rsquo;t she only supposed to fuse up to three types of power?&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&ldquo;How can she fuse four types of power? This breaks the norm!&rdquo; someone exclaimed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the ordinary contestants also looked at Seraphina in shock, as they knew best how difficult it was to fuse four types of power before reaching Empyrean Sacredness. It could even be said to be an impossible feat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their elders had all told them that before reaching Empyrean Sacredness, they could fuse at most three types of power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They carefully sensed Seraphina's incredibly terrifying Sacred Power and discovered that she had indeed fused four different types of power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man exclaimed, "She actually did it! It's said that in the deeper parts of the universe, some prodigies can fuse four types of power before reaching Empyrean Sacredness. But on Racial Convergence Planet, such a thing has never happened before."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A woman responded, "Maybe such a thing happened before, but it was hidden and kept from everyone. It's possible..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man continued, "Anyway, fusing four different types of power before reaching Empyrean Sacredness is enough to prove that Princess Seraphina's strength is terrifying. Her Sacred Power is also stronger and more frightening."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another man sighed, "So this is her trump card. Osborne is doomed to lose. Princess Seraphina's Sacred Power now is far stronger than his. He simply can't be her match."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing these discussions, Seraphina's smile grew even brighter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said calmly, "Do you know why I confidently believe I am the strongest among those who haven't reached Empyrean Sacredness? Because I fused four types of power before reaching Empyrean Sacredness. Such a feat has never occurred in the Glorious Divine Kingdom."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My talent and strength are beyond your imagination. Previously, I fought you with Sacred Power fused from three types of power. I did lose. But unfortunately, if I had gone all out, you would have been easily defeated by me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The real fight begins now. Let's truly determine the winner. I said I would break your legs, and I absolutely will."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Seraphina reached out her hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The massive Supreme Sacred Artifact Blackstar Bow trembled violently. As Seraphina's power grew stronger, its unleashed might instantly intensified.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another terrifying, dazzling arrow appeared on the Blackstar Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, take my attack once more. This is still the seventh arrow of Twinkling Star Arrow. This time, I want to see how you'll block it," Seraphina shouted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, her powerful Sacred Power surged wildly into the Twinkling Star Arrow, making it grow stronger and stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Zorro waved his hand, setting up a stronger protective shield at the edge of the arena to prevent Seraphina's terrifying attack from harming innocent people.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne smiled and said, "Is Sacred Power fused with four types of energy that powerful? I think it's mediocre. Such a trump card isn't enough for you to defeat me. So, I will unleash the final arrow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Saying this, Osborne gripped the Bloodwrought Bow tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He originally intended to unleash the final arrow of Earth Arrow, Arrow Storm, but suddenly changed his mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Osborne's Sacred Power fused with three types of energy, Earth Arrow's Arrow Storm could block Seraphina's arrow but couldn't seriously injure her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne decided to unleash Heaven Arrow.</span></p><div class="pagination">
