  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma crouched beside Osborne, gently stroking his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lay there unresponsive, lost in his own world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma whispered, her voice barely above a murmur, "Do you know who we are? We are from the Augustine family. The power of our genes protects our memories! Anyone who dares to tamper with our memories will face the backlash!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fool!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a playful grin, she pinched his cheek. "Are you regretting your choices now? Honestly, with your strength, I thought it would be nearly impossible for me to subdue you. But look at you now&mdash;you've hurt yourself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that you can't move, don't blame me for what's about to happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you, I'm determined to unlock Satan's Eye today, and only you can help me do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce glint in her eyes, Emma suddenly stripped off her top, wrapping her arms around her chest, feeling a mix of shyness and boldness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You might be immobilized, but you can still see, right? Heh, I've got a pretty good figure, don't you think? Better than your girlfriend Clarissa, for sure!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she let her arms drop and spun around in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think? Are you feeling a little tempted?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced down at Osborne's lower body, her cheeks flushing bright red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll stop teasing you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaning down, Emma pressed her face against Osborne's chest. "Just think of this as a dream!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And with that, she kissed him softly on the lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hands began to explore Osborne's body, moving clumsily as she fumbled through the unfamiliar territory, unsure of what to do next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deciding to pause, Emma pulled out her phone and started searching for a tutorial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like an eternity, she finally found one and mustered the courage to read through it twice, her face burning with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at last, Emma understood what she needed to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Biting her lip, she leaned down and slowly pulled down Osborne's pants, closing her eyes as she grasped his member firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she lowered her head. Before long, the sound of Emma's low, joyful song filled the beach, echoing for two hours before finally culminating in a crescendo of ecstatic cries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma lay beside Osborne, wrapping her arms around his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She kissed him tenderly on the neck, then on his cheeks, and finally on his ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long while, she finally sat up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Closing her eyes, Emma waited a moment before opening them again. When she did, she found her left pupil had transformed, revealing a shimmering silver star within it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Satan's Eye!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The silver star signified that she had unlocked Satan's Eye, but it wasn't just any version; it was a mutated form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A satisfied smile crept across Emma's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne seemed to be lost in a beautiful dream where Emma had been busy pleasing him for two whole hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything felt so incredibly real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when Osborne finally awoke, his expression shifted dramatically as he checked his body, his mind racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lay there on the beach, completely naked, with Emma's unique scent and essence lingering on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? What? What did I just do?" Osborne stammered, utterly bewildered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he could recall was attempting to modify Emma's memories to prevent her from making a foolish decision. Everything had been going smoothly until he was suddenly hit by a terrifying backlash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force of that backlash had dealt a severe blow to his soul. Although his spirit was strong and had a remarkable recovery ability, healing such deep wounds would take time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, Osborne had slipped into a blissful dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, as he emerged from that dream, his soul had regained some strength, and he finally woke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Was that a dream?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or is this reality?" Osborne murmured to himself, still trying to wrap his head around the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's voice broke through his thoughts, laced with surprise. "Osborne, you're awake?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You had such severe soul damage, yet you recovered so quickly? Are you some kind of freak?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her words, Osborne quickly turned to look at her, only to freeze in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma was still without clothes, her alluring curves fully exposed to his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what really caught his attention was the sight of her left eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your Satan's Eye... You've unlocked it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's voice was tinged with disbelief and a hint of bitterness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's expression shifted to one of pride. "Absolutely! And I have you to thank for it. It seems that because of you, my Satan's Eye has mutated."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she leaned closer, allowing him to see the shimmering silver star in her left eye more clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a deep sigh, feeling a mix of emotions wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slowly, he sat up and grabbed his clothes, draping them over Emma's shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pouted. "Hey, what are you doing? We've already done the deed, and now you can't even look at me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a bit sheepish, Osborne rubbed the back of his neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not that I can't look; I just need a moment to process all of this. I still feel like I'm dreaming."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma huffed, crossing her arms, "Think it's unreal? Then let's do it again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Osborne could react, she pushed him back down, straddling him with a playful grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we do it while you're wide awake, you won't think it's a dream anymore!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
