  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rest assured, before I leave, I'll make sure to eliminate all threats and dangers on Blue Planet. I want to ensure that no forces can pose a risk to the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those who choose to stay will have the peace of mind to develop and cultivate their skills in a safe environment. But for those who decide to accompany me to </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, I can't make any guarantees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The truth is, I know next to nothing about that place. The only thing I'm certain of is that the Dark Deity forces there are incredibly powerful, and humans can only hide in the shadows. It's quite possible that I'll find myself in a perilous situation right from the start.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you lack strength, you might end up at the bottom of the food chain in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>. Honestly, it might be wiser to stay on Blue Planet, focus on your training, and consider a move to </span><span>Celestara</span><span> only after reaching the Transcendent Deity level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever you decide, I'll understand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's gaze swept over the gathered crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Now it's time for you to make your choice. Every member of the Augustine family has the right to decide their own future. I won't pressure anyone; in fact, I hope most of you will choose to stay on Blue Planet. I truly can't guarantee your safety in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words hung heavy in the silence that followed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each person was deep in thought, weighing the risks of following Osborne into the unknown against the comfort and security of remaining on Blue Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celestara</span><span> was shrouded in mystery and danger, yet it also promised greater opportunities for growth and advancement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had already proven his strength and leadership; following him could lead to a brighter future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the dangers of </span><span>Celestara</span><span> loomed large.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, staying on Blue Planet meant enjoying a safe training environment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the strongest family here, the Augustine family had the chance to live their best lives, free from threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The choice was a daunting one, and hesitation rippled through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps some had already made up their minds but were reluctant to voice their decisions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here's what we'll do: if you're willing to join me in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, step forward now. The rest should stay on Blue Planet. Our roots are here, and we need more of us to remain," Osborne said again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wherever you go, I'll follow you, no matter what!" Anastasia was the first to speak up, her resolve shining through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe quickly chimed in, "Osborne, I'm with you too! Wherever you go, we go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and affectionately ruffled their hair. "Alright, then!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Bryce stepped forward, a determined look on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra stood behind him, nodding in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce said, "My sister and I want to see </span><span>Celestara</span><span> too! I'm curious about what it's really like. If I have this opportunity and choose to stay on Blue Planet instead, I might regret it later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sounds good!" Osborne replied, nodding back at Bryce with encouragement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Sebastian spoke up, "I'll go as well!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was planning to stay behind to look after the Augustine family while you went to </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, Osborne. But the younger generation has grown strong; they might not need me as much anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to see what </span><span>Celestara</span><span> has to offer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned to Matthew, who stood among the crowd. "Matthew, once Osborne and I leave, the Augustine family will be in your hands. You may not have the best talent among the younger generation, but you're the smartest, the most level-headed, and you have the skills to manage things well. I believe in you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced back at Osborne, seeking his opinion. "What do you think, Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, feeling this decision was a wise one. Matthew's managerial prowess was indeed formidable, far surpassing Osborne's own capabilities. Osborne had always believed Matthew was the rightful heir apparent to the Augustine family's patriarchal throne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's previous prominence had overshadowed Matthew, leaving no room for him to shine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with Osborne embarking on a perilous journey to </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, the Augustine family desperately needed a cogent leader, and Matthew fit the bill perfectly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nodding, Osborne said, "I concur! I am confident Matthew can handle the reins!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew, visibly perturbed, responded, "With you all venturing to </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, I fear I might falter! But given your faith in me, I shall spare no effort to ensure the Augustine family remains unscathed in your absence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes blazed with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Excellent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the ensuing discussions, Wesson, Serena, and others stepped forward, eager to accompany Osborne to </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, but Sebastian promptly vetoed their intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian mandated their roles as assistants to Matthew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, no further volunteers emerged for the </span><span>Celestara</span><span> expedition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While some of the Augustine family's younger members harbored aspirations to set out, they were merely Junior Deities. Their presence in </span><span>Celestara</span><span> would relegate them to the bottom rung of its hierarchy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Consequently, the family's senior leaders opted to stay behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumors of the impending change spread among the common Augustine kinfolk, prompting a decision. The majority opted to remain, preferring a more secure existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Yulissa and Nathan from the </span><span>Dampston</span><span> branch bloodline pledged to accompany Osborne to </span><span>Celestara</span><span>.</span></p><div class="pagination">
