  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, </span><span>Isa</span><span> was sneaking into the Radcliffe Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, she was not there to assassinate Clarissa; she was merely 'employed' by Osborne to take a stroll around the manor's perimeter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were anyone else, they would be immediately detected upon entering the Radcliffe Manor, as it was equipped with the Draco Group's Class B warning system.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But who was </span><span>Isa</span><span> Hank?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a person under the Godfather, she was more familiar with the Draco Group's Class B warning system than anyone else and easily avoided detection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn, being the head of security, was naturally alarmed when he heard an expert had infiltrated the manor and that even the Class B warning system could not locate the person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his love for wine and the allure of Systin, he could not stay behind; he had to return immediately to protect Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, Barlyn left again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the villa, only Osborne and Austin remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin could not help but chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, it looks like the wine will be just for the two of us. When Barlyn comes back and sees the empty bottle, he might come after us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly, "He would not be back anytime soon. We can finish this bottle and let him have some tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Austin nodded eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good! I am already looking forward to it. Glacium Beauty was the best wine I have ever had. If this Systin is even better and more expensive, I have to see if it lives up to its reputation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, she poured a glass for both of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking a sip, Austin's eyes widened, her face flushed, and she began to breathe heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is so hot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So fragrant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin exclaimed. Osborne also took a sip and immediately felt a warm flame entering his mouth, accompanied by a rich, explosive aroma. His face turned red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, it is really different!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it is definitely good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and Austin drank deeply, feeling a warm flame in their stomachs, which made them both feel incredibly comfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their pores opened up as they drank more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more they drank, the hotter they felt, but they could not stop. Even after finishing a bottle, they still felt unsatisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have the last bottle in the car. Should we open it?" Osborne suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin, her rosy lips slightly parted and clearly showing signs of intoxication, brightened up at the suggestion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's more? Hurry up and open it. I want more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pouted at Osborne, as if she were acting coquettishly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her charming demeanor stirred something within Osborne, making him feel even hotter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was also somewhat drunk himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not thinking too much about it, he quickly went to the car to get the last bottle of Systin wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, they were drinking again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they downed glass after glass, their intoxication grew stronger. Neither of them was used to drinking and did not realize that such top-tier wine could easily get them drunk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had already consumed three bottles of this premium red wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin's eyes grew increasingly dazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt her body burning hotter and hotter, as if she had turned into a flame. Unable to bear it, she shed her jacket and tossed it aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, let's continue," Austin said, her speech slurred and her eyes glazed over. She was almost unable to stay upright and fell into Osborne's embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, their bodies shivered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt as if a flame had ignited in his embrace, threatening to unleash his desires. He breathed heavily and looked down at Austin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked back at him, and their eyes locked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, something seemed to ignite between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin's eyes were filled with heat, her body trembling slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Os...Osborne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were already blurred, feeling the masculine aura from Osborne and the heat of his body. She suddenly lifted her hands to wrap around Osborne's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her lips, pink and enticing, found his, and she kissed him passionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt Austin's tongue trying to pry open his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, Osborne's body reacted in kind. He held Austin tightly, letting her tongue into his mouth, and responded passionately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands roamed to her shapely hips, squeezing firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin let out a soft moan, responding even more fervently. She tore off Osborne's clothes and pushed him down onto the sofa, sitting on his lap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their breaths became increasingly heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their bodies pressed closer together until they were completely entangled, waves of pleasure crashing over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The delightful sounds continued for a long time.</span></p><div class="pagination">
