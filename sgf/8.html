  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia frowned, speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just hours ago, she thought she knew Osborne well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But now, seeing the crazed Osborne and the bodyguards on the ground, she realized he wasn&rsquo;t the same pathetic husband she once knew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why has he gone mad?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Could it be that he loves me so much? Did our divorce push him over the edge?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia suddenly thought she could use this to her advantage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Softly, she said, &ldquo;Osborne, I know you&rsquo;ve been wronged. The Wise Order made the decision to leave you with nothing, not me. I still love you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;How about this: I&rsquo;ll ask the hospital staff to leave now. You put down the bomb remote, and we can talk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Maybe we can find a better solution.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I&hellip; I never really wanted to divorce you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia&rsquo;s face was soft with emotion, but to Osborne, it looked fake and disgusting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Cut the act, Ophelia,&rdquo; Osborne sneered. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know me, but I know you too well. Your acting sucks. Get the hospital staff out of here and give me a fair divorce settlement, or we&rsquo;ll both go down together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the heir to a billion-dollar empire. I&rsquo;m just an orphan with nothing. If you go down with me, it&rsquo;s an even bigger win.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You!&rdquo; Ophelia gritted her teeth, furious and frustrated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She felt trapped. She thought she could control the situation easily, but Osborne had been in control all along.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The man she once saw as worthless now had the upper hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was standing alone against the entire Caldwell family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Commoner versus elite?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Was she really going to pay Osborne a divorce settlement?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She felt powerless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She couldn&rsquo;t risk Osborne detonating the bomb.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She didn&rsquo;t want to die.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had just become the Caldwell heiress and hadn&rsquo;t even enjoyed the wealth and power yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that thought, Ophelia finally gave in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Fine, I agree. I&rsquo;ll give you the divorce settlement,&rdquo; she spat. &ldquo;We can draft a new agreement. On behalf of the Caldwell family, I&rsquo;ll give you two million dollars.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne sighed in relief but sneered, &ldquo;Two million? Are you kidding me? I&rsquo;ve endured three years of humiliation and abuse from the Caldwell family. Two million to make me go away? Ha! I&rsquo;d rather take us all down.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, he raised the detonator, ready to press the button.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Ophelia turned pale and quickly intervened. &ldquo;How much do you want? A hundred million is out of the question. Even as the Caldwell heiress, I can&rsquo;t authorize that. The Wise Order oversees everything.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She stared at him, trying to show confidence she didn&rsquo;t feel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;If you insist on a hundred million, then go ahead and blow us up.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne paused, pretending to think it over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He knew the Caldwell family&rsquo;s situation well. Ophelia couldn&rsquo;t possibly give him a hundred million in cash. He was just aiming high to negotiate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne wasn&rsquo;t worried at all; he had the upper hand now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After some back-and-forth, they finally struck a deal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Caldwell family agreed to compensate Osborne with twenty million.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was pleased but pretended to be at a loss, demanding Ophelia draft a new divorce settlement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon after, the twenty million hit his account, and Osborne finally relaxed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He actually pulled it off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He passed the Godfather&rsquo;s heir test.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s eyes were a bit red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If not for the Godfather&rsquo;s test, he would never have dared to storm the Caldwell Manor alone. And getting the Caldwell family to cough up twenty million? That was a damn miracle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this moment, Osborne was overwhelmed by triumphant emotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just hours ago, he was beaten by Ophelia&rsquo;s bodyguards, forced to sign a divorce agreement that left him with nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But now, he got the compensation he deserved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Most importantly, he passed the Godfather&rsquo;s first test.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What would the Godfather reward him with?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What would his reward be? Wealth? Power? Or women?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The renowned Godfather, his granddad, wouldn&rsquo;t be stingy, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now, Osborne just needed to get out of the Caldwell Manor and claim his reward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne straightened up and walked towards the door. Ophelia and the others, despite their frustration, didn&rsquo;t dare to stop him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But then, everything changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A woman in the crowd glanced at her phone and suddenly gasped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ophelia, we can&rsquo;t let him leave!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been tricked! That loser, the bombs on him&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Are fake!&rdquo;</p><div class="pagination">
