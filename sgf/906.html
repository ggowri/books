  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's voice rang out icy cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it's not over, then you know what you need to do, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is Osborne's Honor Quest Ceremony, and yet here's an old fossil trying to bully him on stage?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she cast a sharp glance at Rumen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cold sweat began to bead on his forehead as Rumen looked at her, disbelief written all over his face. He even rubbed his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you are? Who are you?" Rumen stammered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa let out a mocking laugh. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't know who I am? I wondered where your eyesight was going! Who am I? I'm 'Night.'"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her words, Rumen stood frozen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cold sweat on his brow doubled, and he found himself instinctively taking steps back. Below the stage, the crowd was equally stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's Night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my god! She's the one who just skyrocketed to the top of the Godson Rankings? I thought she'd be some old powerhouse, not a young woman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, it's been ages since someone from the younger generation topped the Godson Rankings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The murmurs of disbelief spread like wildfire through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It makes sense now why Osborne insisted his Honor Quest Ceremony wasn't over. He must have known Night would show up. There seems to be something special between them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa ignored the chatter, her icy gaze locked onto Rumen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a voice only he could hear, she said, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I warned Everett from the League of Divine Descent before. Osborne is my man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>You can go after him, but only if you're in the same generation. If anyone from a </span><span>higher rank or generation dares to bully him, they'd better watch out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looks like Everett didn't fill you in, did he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tone turned even colder, causing Rumen's expression to darken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He whipped around, glaring at Everett on the platform. It was true. Everett hadn't told him about this. He hadn't mentioned that Night Witch had such a connection to Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Rumen had known that Osborne was Night Witch's man, he never would have gone after Osborne like this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett quickly turned away, pretending not to see Rumen</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>s questioning gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way he would spill that information to Rumen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last time he was in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, he had intended to challenge Sebastian but ended up getting thoroughly beaten by </span><span>&lsquo;</span><span>Miss Night</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Everett was a top-tier Class S Supreme Overlord, he still had his pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Getting beaten by Isa wasn't the most humiliating thing, but he'd prefer it if no one ever found out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen, now visibly flustered, explained in a tone only she could hear, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Night, I didn't know. Everett never told me! I had no idea Osborne was connected to you. I was wrong; I'll leave right now and won't interfere with the younger generation again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He started to back away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did I say you could leave?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's icy tone stopped him in his tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen froze, fear creeping back into his expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smirked, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you can bully my man and just walk away without paying a price? What kind of world do you live in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen's face paled. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... what should I do then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Slap yourself twice and then get out! Don't make me do it myself, because if I step in, it won't be just a couple of slaps."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Isa dismissed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their conversation had been a private exchange, and others couldn</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>t hear them. If the crowd had heard it, they would have been left utterly speechless, jaws dropped in disbelief at the reverse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was oblivious to the exchange between Isa and Rumen; all he could see was Isa's icy glare directed at Rumen, making it clear she was ready to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of concern washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, be careful! He's a top-tier Class S Supreme Overlord. He's incredibly powerful!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rushed to stand in front of her, his face filled with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling Osborne's protective presence warmed Isa's heart, and a smile broke through her earlier chill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's alright. Mr. Flores is here to keep things in check, right? With him around, Rumen won't dare to make a move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Isa turned toward Jackie, who was looking increasingly rattled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Flores, am I right?" Isa pressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackie, clearly flustered, nodded vigorously. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course! The Honor Quest Ceremony isn't over yet. Rumen is breaking the rules, and I will punish him..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Jackie's words were cut short as Rumen suddenly raised his hand and landed two hard slaps across his own face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound echoed through the arena, each slap landing with enough force to draw blood from the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen stammered, "I... I'll take responsibility!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was wrong. I'm leaving right now and promise to respect the rules of the Honor Quest Ceremony."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, Rumen hastily retreated from the stage, practically fleeing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd stood in stunned silence with all eyes wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Murmurs began to spread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumen? A top-tier Class S Supreme Overlord, ranked in the top fifty of the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just slapped himself? He's actually admitting he was wrong?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, still surprised from the surreal turn of events, turned at Jackie in shock.</span></p><div class="pagination">
