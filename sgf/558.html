  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How could David be dead? No one can kill him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The members of the Ransford branch bloodline were in utter disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam responded coldly, "If you want to know if David is dead, why don't you try contacting him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Ransford branch members hurriedly tried to reach David.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, their expressions turned grim as they realized they couldn't get in touch with David.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam's face also grew darker.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While David's death meant he had lost a formidable rival, it also revealed that Osborne's power far exceeded their expectations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">More importantly, he had lost the ability to track Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne possessed spatial power, and even though the emblem sent out a signal every fifteen minutes, catching up to him would be nearly impossible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam realized that the situation had just become a lot more complicated!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He glanced at Rodney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Noticing Rodney's calm demeanor and even a hint of satisfaction, Sam was puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney didn't seem at all concerned about failing to catch Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam had a suspicion but chose not to voice it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney then waved his hand and said, "Let's go. If even David was killed by Osborne, then Osborne is too strong. I'm giving up on the Heir's Emblem.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sam, good luck to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Rodney and his men quickly left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Watching Rodney's retreating figure, Sam sneered. "Rodney, you've already formed alliances with four other branch bloodlines. Do you expect me to believe you're really giving up on the Heir's Emblem? Ridiculous! You can't fool me so easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I'm not mistaken, you've got a way to track Osborne down. You're just pretending to withdraw because you don't want me to compete with you, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hah, how absurd!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam whispered to the man behind him, "Ronan, you're the best at concealment. Follow Rodney and report his location to me at all times!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Understood!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ronan Augustine nodded, activating his power. His body became transparent as he swiftly followed Rodney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam muttered to himself, "Rodney, I hope you really can catch Osborne. But in the end, the winner will only be me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once Rodney and his men were far enough away, Rodney activated Satan's Eye. After confirming that no one was following them, a cold smile appeared on his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, David is dead! Excellent. That's one less competitor for me!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And it seems Sam has no way to pursue Osborne! This is my chance. If I can corner Osborne, the Heir's Emblem will be mine!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He then smirked with satisfaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"First, let's pinpoint Osborne's general location, and then we can begin."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ten minutes later, Rodney received the latest coordinates.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing that Osborne was only 12.5 miles away, Rodney's eyes lit up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He activated Satan's Eye to scout ahead. However, the dense ancient trees obstructed his view, and he couldn't see Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wasn't worried, though, and sneered, "We can start now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney then took out a palm-sized disk. The disk had a square hole in the center and emitted a unique energy wave, ancient and mysterious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ancient magic weapon, Forbidden Space Disk!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney murmured, "This Forbidden Space Disk is a level five ancient magic weapon. Once activated, the space within a 30-mile radius will become incredibly stable as if frozen. Even with spatial power, Osborne won't be able to use Spatial Tearing, let alone interdimensional travel to escape!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Without his spatial power, Osborne is nothing but my prey!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Rodney activated the Forbidden Space Disk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The disk released a strange energy that merged into the air. Although the others felt no change, Rodney knew that the space within a 30-mile radius was now frozen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Unless Osborne has mastered intermediate spatial power, he won't be able to use Spatial Tearing anymore!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Everyone spread out and surround Osborne!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you see him, don't engage in a direct fight. Just stall him and wait for my support!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Rodney issued the order, his team immediately dispersed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The more than fifty people under his command quickly spread out. They split into several small teams, each responsible for a 1.5-mile area, forming a net to surround Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What Rodney didn't know was that Osborne had already activated Satan's Eye and was observing their actions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne raised an eyebrow, thinking, "What are they trying to do?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Are they really planning to trap me? Don't they realize that with just one interdimensional travel, I could easily slip past such a blockade?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne frowned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't think Rodney could be that foolish. His eyes fell on the disk in Rodney's hand, pondering its purpose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's that? Could it be Rodney's trump card against me? If he wants to deal with me, the only way would be to limit my spatial power..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that thought, Osborne suddenly frowned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He waved his hand, attempting to tear open a dimensional rift. Soon, his expression grew serious as he realized that the space around him had become as solid as steel, and his spatial power couldn't tear through it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was momentarily stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So that's it! He's frozen the space around me with some special method, preventing me from tearing open a dimensional rift and escaping!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once Osborne understood, he couldn't help but marvel at Rodney's ability.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As expected, none of these people could be underestimated. But if Rodney thinks this is enough to trap me, he's gravely mistaken!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now that they've spread out, it's my turn to start hunting!" Osborne thought.</p><div class="pagination">
