  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela had once dared to hope that Osborne would work a miracle and break into the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, she knew she'd been dead wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't just show up; he made a splash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, he took down Jared's team, who had been snugly holding the tenth spot. Jared was left badly hurt, and Osborne snatched over 300 thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne pulled out over a hundred sixth-layer tokens. His score shot up by 6.5 million, and he even helped Clara and Leroy squeeze into the top ten with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What an idiot Osborne is!" Danilo grumbled next to Angela.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was twisted in pain as he stared at the leaderboard, especially at Osborne's name sitting pretty in third place. Instead of getting excited, all he felt was a nagging sense of regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If Osborne hadn't shared those tokens with Clara and Leroy, his score could've shot up by another 10 million, hitting 17 million! He'd have more than twice what Agatha has!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought was driving him crazy. If that had happened, Osborne, a disciple of the Mystic Sirius Sect, would've had a real shot at winning the state duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His victory wouldn't just be a personal glory; it would put the Mystic Sirius Sect on the map.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bunch of young talents from the Glorious Divine Kingdom might flock to the sect because of Osborne's win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could reach new heights of power,</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, seeing Osborne splitting five hundred thousand points between Clara and Leroy, Danilo was seething with frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What on earth was he thinking?" Danilo kept muttering, shaking his head in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his eyes, it was simply unforgivable that Osborne had thrown away his shot at victory for the sake of two girls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was itching to give Osborne a piece of his mind, but with the state duel still in full swing, there was no way to get in touch with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All Danilo could do was stand there, feeling utterly helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela could sense Danilo's inner turmoil and shared his bewilderment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also thought it was a bit daft of Osborne to hand out so many points to Clara and Leroy. Those girls, no matter how much of a leg-up he gave them, didn't stand a chance of making a real mark in the zone duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The points would have been far more useful to him in securing the top spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But still, she decided to back Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela said, "Those tokens were his discovery. He can do whatever he pleases with them. Even if it means passing up the state duel championship, it's his call, and no one has the right to point fingers!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's already brought enough glory to the Mystic Sirius Sect and even put Tempest Fortress City on the map! Anyone who bad-mouths him for this... well, they'd better watch their step, because I won't hold back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Angela shot another stare at Danilo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danilo squirmed uncomfortably, realizing she was talking to him. "Ms. Olsen, you've got me all wrong! I'm not blaming Osborne. I just think it's a real pity. Like you said, he's earned respect, and the Mystic Sirius Sect owes him big-time. I'd never hold it against him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela said with a nod, appreciating Danilo's take on the situation, "That's a relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But let's keep our eyes peeled. Even though Osborne's score is pretty impressive right now, that just makes him and the girls the top targets. The real battle has just started! If they can't ward off all these tough competitors gunning for their points, they could easily drop out of the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That would be an absolute catastrophe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Angela stared at the projection screens, a sense of unease settled in her gut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She saw that a whole bunch of powerful contestants and their teams had shifted their attention to Osborne, Clara, and Leroy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious they were just waiting to pounce and snatch away the points the trio had just racked up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clenched her fists tightly and muttered under her breath, "Osborne, if you want to make a name for yourself in the state duel, the real challenge is only beginning! I really hope you can hang on to those points!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, deep inside the Arctic Maw Chasm, Osborne, Clara, and Leroy's sudden spike in scores hadn't escaped anyone's notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their rapid climb up the rankings had caught the eye of many other competitors, especially those who had been comfortably in the top positions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was impossible not to notice that their own rankings had dropped by as many as three spots as Osborne and his friends charged into the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell just happened?" a contestant blurted out in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did three people suddenly rocket into the top ten? Are the scoreboards malfunctioning?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sadly for them, the leaderboards were working just fine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they quickly glanced at their badges and saw three dazzling white dots grouped closely in one area, their eyes all lit up at the same time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne? Clara? Leroy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They were ranked ninety-sixth, one hundred-eighth, and two hundred ninety-ninth respectively! How in the world did they amass so many points? They're like sitting ducks!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we take out those three, we could scoop up almost two million points! With my current score, that'll definitely land me a spot in the top ten!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's move in and take them by surprise!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry! We've got to get there before the others! The first one to take them down gets the lion's share of the points!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go, let's go, let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those three aren't high-profile powerhouses. They can't be that tough. They must have just gotten lucky, scooped up a whole bunch of tokens, and now they're padding their scores!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've gotta take them down and snatch their points!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those lacking true mettle have no business lingering in the top ten of the scoreboard. Let's head over right away and hammer this truth into their thick skulls!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's roll!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, the top thirty contestants and their teams sprang into action. They quickly zeroed in on Osborne's location via their badges and charged towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were like a pack of ravenous wolves that had caught the scent of fresh prey, drooling over the points Osborne and his friends had just snagged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, any of those top-thirty heavyweights who took down Osborne and his mates would see their scores shoot up into the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who could resist such a golden opportunity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The powerhouses hungry for a top-ten ranking had gone completely berserk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them was Conrad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face darkened when he realized he'd dropped from ninth to twelfth place. He could hardly believe what he was seeing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Three spots just like that? How is that even freaking possible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly checked the scoreboard and saw that Osborne, Clara, and Leroy had made their way into the top ten, shoving him out. That realization sent him into a blind rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad growled, "It's that son of a gun, Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How the hell did he get so lucky? Who does he think he is, trying to boot me out of the top ten? This is crazy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not gonna let this slide! That nobody, ranked over a hundred, had the nerve to turn down my offer and now he wants to trample all over me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough is enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a steely determination, Conrad snapped, "Everyone, rally around! We're going after them, and we're going now!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
