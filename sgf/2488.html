  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana immediately asked curiously, "You say you know who the biggest slave trafficking organization is in this Stellar Region of Racial Convergence Planet, and you're confident you can find some evidence? Are you sure?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I remember correctly, you came to Racial Convergence Planet from the small life-bearing planet, Celestara Planet, just over half a year ago, right? Are you sure you're not joking with me?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded seriously. "I'm absolutely sure."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then tell me, who is this biggest slave trafficking organization you mentioned?" Adriana asked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne hesitated immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was almost certain that the biggest slave trafficking organization on Racial Convergence Planet was one of the three Top-tier Powers, the Phantom Commerce Guild. However, the Phantom Commerce Guild was too powerful. Moreover, Adriana despised slave trafficking organizations so much. If Adriana found out that the biggest slave trafficking organization was the Phantom Commerce Guild, would she impulsively go and cause trouble for them?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana was very powerful, and the Fairy Moon Sect was also strong. However, compared to the Phantom Commerce Guild and Russell, they were far inferior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne worried that revealing it would put Adriana in danger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's wrong? Can't you tell me? Or do you think they're too powerful, and you're afraid telling me will put me in danger?" Adriana said with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne asked in surprise, "How did you know?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana calmly said, "You don't think you can find out something that I can't, do you? Although I despise slave trafficking organizations, I'm not a fool. If they're too powerful for me to handle, I won't act recklessly. I just wanted you to tell me to confirm if you really know."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, Osborne gave a wry smile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana's words made sense. With her strength and status, how could she not know something that even Osborne knew?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne said, "In the Racial Convergence Planet's Stellar Region, the largest slave trafficking organization is definitely the Phantom Commerce Guild."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he looked at Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana's expression remained unchanged, utterly calm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obviously, she had known about this long ago.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt relieved, then gritted his teeth and said, "Ms. Alba, I hope you can use the power of the Fairy Moon Sect to help me investigate the Frenetic Storm Warband. My parents were sold by a slave trafficking organization under the Phantom Commerce Guild to the Frenetic Storm Warband. I don't even know if they're still alive now."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I hope to find the Frenetic Storm Warband and rescue my parents. Additionally, the Frenetic Storm Warband purchased many slaves from the Phantom Commerce Guild. We might be able to find some evidence of the Phantom Commerce Guild's slave trafficking from them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne looked at Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana smiled and said, "Although I think it's difficult to find evidence of the Phantom Commerce Guild's slave trafficking from the Frenetic Storm Warband, since this concerns your parents' lives, I will certainly help you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I will have the Fairy Moon Sect's intelligence department find a way to locate the Frenetic Storm Warband. Once we find any clues, I will contact you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing her words, Osborne felt a bit emotional.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Fairy Moon Sect is very powerful, and investigating the Frenetic Storm Warband is definitely not a difficult task. Perhaps the news will come soon. If so, Osborne will be able to rescue his parents.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sincerely said, "Ms. Alba, thank you. I owe you another favor."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana waved her hand and said with a smile, "The more favors you owe me, the happier I am. Maybe, in the near future, we will fight together against the Phantom Commerce Guild."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, before you have enough strength, don't tell anyone about this. The Phantom Commerce Guild is incredibly powerful and mysterious. Their slave trade isn't limited to the Racial Convergence Planet's Stellar Region but even extends to the surrounding Stellar Regions."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We can't act rashly. Once we take action, we must ensure we can directly eliminate the Phantom Commerce Guild."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Adriana's eyes were filled with cold killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very curious, thinking, "Why does Ms. Alba hate a slave trading organization like the Phantom Commerce Guild so much? She has a story!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne didn't ask further. Adriana treated him well, but their relationship hadn't reached the level where they could share each other's secrets, nor could they be considered friends.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the gap in strength between them was too great.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana was more like a senior who saw great potential in Osborne's future, willing to offer help and invest in him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, if there's nothing else, I'll take my leave," Adriana said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she took out something, casually tossed it to Osborne, and continued, "In the next six months, you need to be more careful."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your performance in the zone duel was too flashy. I'm afraid many people will want to find you and take you down. Make sure you don't die. If that happens, Isa will be sad. I'm leaving. Take care and stay alive."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Adriana had already disappeared in front of Osborne. He didn't even notice how she left.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked down at the item Adriana handed him at the end and froze. "Sublime Concealment Orb?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne never expected Adriana to give him a Sublime Concealment Orb. He knew very well how powerful its effects were. With the help of the Sublime Concealment Orb, he no longer had to worry about being tracked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could conceal or alter his aura at any time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne once had a Sublime Concealment Orb. But later, he gave it to Agatha. If the Sublime Concealment Orb had stayed with him, Lionel, Aaron, and the others would never have found him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I owe Ms. Alba more and more," Osborne murmured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Sublime Concealment Orb was extremely precious. Although it couldn't attack or defend, to Osborne, it was more valuable than an ordinary supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had no idea how to repay Adriana at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Forget it. With my current strength, I can't repay Adriana. I'll wait until I'm stronger to repay her. For now, I need to return to Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I need to find Agatha first, then find a quiet place to train. Once Ms. Alba locates the Frenetic Storm Warband, I'll go rescue my parents."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At</span><span> this, Osborne quickly used the Sublime Concealment Orb to alter his aura, even his appearance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, as long as Osborne didn't reveal his identity, even someone most familiar with him would find it hard to recognize him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll return to Racial Convergence Planet now." With that, Osborne tore open a dimensional rift, exited deep space, and returned to Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He immediately contacted Agatha.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After confirming that Agatha was safe and still in Tempest Fortress City, Osborne finally felt completely at ease.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, Osborne returned to Tempest Fortress City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an inn at Tempest Fortress City, Osborne found Agatha and then entered her small courtyard.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha smiled and said, "Osborne, congratulations on winning the Zone Duel championship."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everyone in Zephyr State is talking about you. You represented Zephyr State in the battle. You won the Zone Duel championship with overwhelming dominance, bringing great honor to Zephyr State."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even throughout Eastern Zone 3, you're now a celebrity."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne chatted with Agatha for a bit, then they each went into a room to start training.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't expect Adriana to be so fast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne asked her to help investigate Frenetic Storm Warband. But in less than three days, she already had news.</span></p><div class="pagination">
