  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Kurt finished speaking, the group of young men surrounding Osborne wore cold smirks on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at him, all cocky just a moment ago!" one sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who does he think he is, going against Mr. Baxter? That's just asking for trouble!" another chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't you hear what Mr. Kurt said? Beg for mercy! He's giving you a chance to live&mdash;don't be stupid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, hurry up and beg!" they all shouted at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a distance, onlookers began to gather, drawn by the commotion. But as soon as they recognized Kurt, their expressions shifted to fear, and they quickly retreated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that Kurt's reputation was well-known throughout Apocalypse City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt, however, reveled in the fear he inspired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thrived on the sight of others trembling before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what irked him was that Osborne, already surrounded, showed no signs of fear, maintaining his calm demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does he have some hidden trick up his sleeve?" Kurt thought, furrowing his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he quickly dismissed the notion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who cares if he does? No matter what he's hiding, it can't be bigger than what I've got! I'm the scion of the Baxter family, and my father is a Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the West Zone, the Baxter family is a top-tier power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only ones who can stand against us are the Sanctum of Night and the Sanctum of Light. This guy clearly isn't one of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, I don't even know him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's not included among the elite I know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that confidence, Kurt said, "So, are you going to beg for mercy or what? You really think I wouldn't dare to kill you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle, "Kurt, do you really think your little gang can take me down?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You didn't even bother to bring in more heavy hitters. I can't tell if you're overly confident or just plain stupid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm betting on the latter&mdash;you're just too foolish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt's anger flared at those words. "You're looking to die, aren't you? You think I need more help to deal with you? Do you really see yourself as a threat? I, Kurt, can crush you all by myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spoke with unshakeable confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his eyes, Osborne was just another young face in a city full of them, and among the youth in Apocalypse City, he was already at the top of the food chain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he couldn't gauge Osborne's exact level, he dismissed the idea that anyone could hide their strength from him. To someone at his level, it was easy to mask one's aura and realm. He was sure that Osborne couldn't possibly be stronger than he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a dozen guys backing him up, how could they not handle Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Is that so? Well then, let's get this party started!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you think you can kill me, I welcome you to try! But just a heads-up&mdash;if you attack, don't blame me for fighting back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I manage to capture you... well, the Baxter family will have to pay a price to get you back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt's rage boiled over. "You think you can capture me? You've got some nerve! If you want to challenge me, I'll make an example out of you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can kill you without a second thought, and no one will be able to touch me for it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Attack! Take him down! And grab his Dimensional Bag for me! He dares to steal my Miracle Elixirs. In the end, everything he has will belong to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt's arrogance was palpable, and as he issued the command, the group of young men sprang into action, their faces twisted with malicious glee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Crossing Mr. Baxter? You deserve to perish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deafening roar, the group of over a dozen charged at Osborne, their combined power radiating an overwhelming ferocity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them was no lightweight. They were all First-rate Powers' talents, each having reached the Deity King realm&mdash;super geniuses in their own right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But unfortunately for them, their opponent was Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne barely acknowledged their onslaught. His gaze locked onto Kurt with a cold smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he was engulfed by their attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt and his crew wore expressions of disdain, surprised to see Osborne not even attempt to fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He can't be this weak, can he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pathetic! I thought he'd at least put up a struggle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Turns out he's just a waste of space!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But their confidence quickly shifted to shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As their attacks dissipated, they found Osborne still standing, completely unharmed amidst the chaos around him. His clothes and hair were untouched, not even a strand out of place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight left them gaping in disbelief, and even Kurt was taken aback for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he quickly regained his composure, a menacing glint in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You little bastard! So you've got some skills! But it won't be enough to save you from me! Prepare to be defeated!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt stepped into action himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a mid-stage Deity King, he was already among the elite of Apocalypse City's younger generation. With his father being a Supernal Deity King, Kurt had been trained by the best since childhood, making him far stronger than the others in his group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, he closed the distance to Osborne, throwing a powerful punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the next heartbeat, his expression shifted dramatically&mdash;Osborne had caught his fist!</span></p><div class="pagination">
