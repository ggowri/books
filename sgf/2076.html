  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you say Ascension Five?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's voice suddenly rose. He felt utterly exasperated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued, "Do you know that among all the young cultivators under three hundred years old in Elf City, there are only a handful at Ascension Five? Out of the tens of thousands of geniuses from the World of Racial Convergence who took the test yesterday, fewer than thirty reached Ascension Five!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought Alfreda was being unrealistic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda twirled a stray lock of hair with her slender fingers. Her bright green eyes shone playfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled confidently and said, "But I am Ascension Five! My team members must be strong. Besides, your level is too low, and I must protect you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I plan to form the strongest exploration team. We will venture deep into Umbra Earth to search for treasures. Only a team composed entirely of warriors above Ascension Five gives me the confidence to break through Umbra Earth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Including anyone below Ascension Five would only slow us down. I might even have to waste energy protecting them! Of course, I am not talking about you. You are my friend. I am happy to protect you and even let you hold me back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda said this with a proud smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gaped, unable to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could not argue with her reasoning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the team size was limited, so it made sense to choose the strongest members. Yet, her plan still seemed impractical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, the truly powerful geniuses from the World of Racial Convergence would first join stronger exploration teams such as the Shadow Elf Royal Family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought it was nearly impossible to recruit any Ascension Five experts. Even those who had reached Ascension Four were hard to lure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, even the Ascension Three and Ascension Two geniuses now refused to join Alfreda's team. They did not want to risk offending the Fire Elf Royal Family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's strict requirement of Ascension Five struck Osborne as completely far-fetched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can anyone really join?" he wondered silently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine," Osborne said, "if we cannot recruit anyone else, then let it be just the two of us in Umbra Earth. You might be right. Those below Ascension Five would only drag us down..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words were partly a compromise and partly self-comfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rest assured," Alfreda whispered suddenly, "we will definitely recruit warriors at Ascension Five because I have a trump card!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What trump card?" Osborne asked, staring at her in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could not imagine what special trick she had to attract Ascension Five warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was curious, but Alfreda remained mysterious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You will know in time. Now is not the moment to worry," she said calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She waited, ignoring the growing buzz around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you hear that?" someone exclaimed. "The registration requirement here is Ascension Five?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Princess Alfreda out of her mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One voice said, "I hesitated for a long time before risking offending the Fire Elf Royal Family to join Princess Alfreda's exploration team, all for a chance to enter Umbra Earth. But when I tried to sign up, I found the requirement was Ascension Five!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another added, "She is insane! Absolutely insane!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A third shouted, "Princess Alfreda requires not only that applicants be at least Ascension Five but also that their overall score be no lower than Class B! Has she completely lost her mind?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even the Shadow Elf Royal Family only asks for Ascension Four. Anyone at Ascension Five, even with just a D-level score, can join their team!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fourth voice argued, "Here, the score must be at least Class B. What kind of outstanding genius would even consider joining Princess Alfreda's exploration team?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all shouted, "She is insane!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one like that will ever join her team!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their shouts spread quickly, and soon everyone knew Alfreda's recruitment requirements. The crowd erupted into heated chatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked at her with ridicule and disdain. Everyone thought Alfreda would never be able to recruit a single member.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Alfreda paid them no heed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched her calm demeanor and furrowed his brows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda appeared truly confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could not understand how she remained so composed amid the mocking stares and increasingly harsh remarks. He decided not to care about their words. Instead, he closed his eyes and resumed his meditation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a burst of hearty laughter rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The laughter was so familiar that Osborne opened his eyes and looked around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere grew even livelier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Princes and princesses from various Elf Royal Families began to arrive, all eager to recruit members for their own exploration teams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of them noticed Alfreda recruiting and approached out of curiosity. Among them were Desmond and Monica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they learned of Alfreda's outrageous recruitment standards, they were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Monica could not help but burst into mocking laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her laughter dripped with derision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda looked over. When her eyes met Monica's, she snorted coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you laughing at? Do you want me to beat you again?" she challenged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At her words, Monica's expression changed instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her facial wounds had long healed under Life Elf's care, but at that moment, she felt a familiar burning pain in her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grew furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you, Alfreda! How dare you act so arrogantly? If you try to mess with me again, you will end up locked away in the Dungeon of Stillness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda curled her lips in disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are such a waste. You cannot beat me and only know how to snitch. If you are so confident, then don't snitch! Come challenge me and I will give you a proper lesson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You!" Monica retorted, feeling both humiliated and enraged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Desmond stepped in and stopped her. He shook his head and said quietly, "Monica, there is no need to fight here. We will deal with her once we reach Umbra Earth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reluctantly, Monica nodded and glared fiercely at Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda returned the glare with a defiant look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desmond then positioned himself between Monica and Alfreda. He turned his cold gaze toward Osborne standing beside Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes flashed with a chilling murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said in a cold tone, "Princess Alfreda, has this Human already joined your exploration team?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda snorted and replied, "Of course. Why not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desmond laughed in disdain, "Of course, he can join! I find it utterly laughable. Princess Alfreda's criteria demand candidates be above Ascension Five with an overall score of at least Class B, yet this lowly Human is only at Ascension One Supernal Deity King! His qualifications are worlds apart from your standards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why would you let him join? Do you have a crush on this lowly Human? Otherwise, why would you bring such a waste along to explore Umbra Earth?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This lowly Human even secretly contacted Peggy yesterday, hoping she would make an exception for him. But Peggy despised him and cast him out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A waste rejected by Peggy now gets to join your exploration team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are truly tolerant, Princess Alfreda."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered, "Are you here to take in unwanted trash?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desmond's words dripped with contempt, leaving the air heavy with tension.</span></p><div class="pagination">
