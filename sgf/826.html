  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa was enveloped in Osborne's embrace. A smile played on her lips.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She said, "Not bad. It took you just a week to grasp Explosive Force. Faster than I expected! But mastering Explosive Force alone won't be enough to defeat me. Are you getting ahead of yourself?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her words quickly quelled his excitement.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He touched his nose awkwardly. "Can't I have a moment of pride first?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa cupped his face, planting a firm kiss on his lips.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Want to be proud? Perfect your Explosive Force first! Once you've mastered it, you should be able to defeat Marvin as I did.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then, you can challenge me."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's expression turned solemn.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It had taken him seven days of intense practice to finally master the cultivation of Explosive Force. How much longer would it take to perfect it?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only when he had honed his skills to perfection could he dare to stand in the same arena to challenge Isa.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The pressure mounted.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In half a month, I will master Explosive Force completely! I will defeat all challengers and then you."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne encouraged himself.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I believe in you," Isa replied. "As I've said before, once you achieve this, you can do whatever you want to me."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her words turned Osborne on.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His arms tightened around Isa as he grinned. "Let's talk about that later. Right now, I want to devour you!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His lips found hers.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa responded with fervor, allowing his hands to roam until he sought to explore her pussy. Then, as before, she kicked him away.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne held his chest, at a loss for words.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His resolve to defeat Isa in half a month only strengthened.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You take your time practicing. I must leave now," Isa announced suddenly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's mood darkened. The past seven days had been a blissful mix of training and moments with Isa. Though they hadn't crossed the final threshold of having sex, he felt utterly content and at peace.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He cherished every moment spent with Isa, who possessed a captivating duality; her strength intertwined seamlessly with a tender submissiveness. With her, his blood raced with fervor, only for her to soothe his lust, leaving him tranquil yet utterly enthralled.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The thought of parting from Isa again was unbearable.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Isa, are you going to find the woman?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa nodded. "Yes, I need to find her. She's crucial to this world, and we owe her. We must locate her as soon as possible."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's spirits sank.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa smiled, stepping closer to rest her head against his chest. She softly murmured, "Don't worry. I'll be fine. Besides, the Honor Quest Ceremony is in half a month, and I will challenge you again.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's only half a month. If you miss me too much, fuck me here. I won't resist.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yet, should you have sex with me without besting me first, you'll forever remain my lesser, my little man! You'll never seize the reins to claim the title of master over me."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After delivering her provocative challenge, Isa turned her gaze towards Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's breath hitched.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The thought of having sex with Isa right there was tempting, especially since she couldn't resist.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was indeed tempted, yet the victory over Isa still eluded him. He hadn't yet flipped the script to claim his dominance. Thus, with a resolve tinged by reluctance, he refused to have sex with Isa, and his pride was unwilling to settle for anything less than triumph.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gritting his teeth, he declared, "No! In half a month, I will defeat you with my own strength! Only then will I have sex with you!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isa's smile widened.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's the man I want. I appreciate your backbone. I'll await the day you defeat me and have sex with me."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cupping his face, she kissed his cheeks again.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I should go now!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Remember, Explosive Force is potent, but don't rely on it solely. Your path is different from mine. You must work hard to improve your extra energy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Without diversity, you'll struggle to defeat me in half a month."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Isa departed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her frequent glances back betrayed her reluctance to leave Osborne. Yet, she pressed on, vanishing from his sight.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why must it be so?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne sighed, gathering his things to return to Rosmandi.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Honor Quest Ceremony is in half a month. The Augustine family's invitations will soon reach every major superpower. I can already envision the hustle and bustle that will envelop Newport City.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In the coming days, luminaries from every global superpower will converge upon the Augustine Estate! Yet, there remains no whisper of Godfather's whereabouts. With his absence, the Augustine family hangs in jeopardy!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I must return now!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne tore open the fabric of space itself, embarking on the interdimensional travel.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Having surmounted the barriers to reaching Class AAA, Osborne had been absorbing the very essence of the star power during this time, evolving in every facet of his being. Each interdimensional travel now carried him a breathtaking ninety miles.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tethynia lay but a little over six thousand miles from the Rosmandi. In less than ten interdimensional travels, Osborne found himself back in Rosmandi.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He arrived in Skyefall.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How has Clarissa been faring? And what of the Radcliffe family?"</p><div class="pagination">
