  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's words ignited a fire in the hearts of Damian and the other Deschanel family members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they stood before the thirty-six deities of their clan, the overwhelming power radiating from those deities filled each of their hearts with pride and exhilaration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We, the Deschanel family, will give our all! Even if it costs us our lives, we will obey our ancestors' commands to conquer this new world and reign as its kings!" Damian declared, his voice brimming with fervor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph smiled, a glimmer of satisfaction in his eyes, "Now, tell me about the current state of this new world. Lay out all the potential threats that could trip us up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damian nodded eagerly, launching into a rapid-fire account of the landscape before them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbeknownst to them, just a short distance away, Osborne lurked in a parallel dimension, absorbing every arrogant word that spilled from their lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression darkened as he processed the implications of their ambitions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "This is bad news!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deschanel family has a hundred deities who have survived since the Age of Gods, and these thirty-six might just be the weakest among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stronger ones haven't awakened yet simply because they need more time to regain their strength. Soon enough, they'll rise too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence, the clan leader, was a top-tier Deity Overlord in his prime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What will happen when all one hundred Deschanel gods awaken?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer terror of it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What blows my mind is that the Deschanel Clan actually aims to dominate Blue Planet, wanting everyone and every faction to bow down to them&mdash;turning all into subjects of the Deschanel Clan, or worse, slaves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weight of this realization pressed heavily on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deschanel Clan and the Augustine family were both situated within Rosmandi. If the Deschanel Clan aimed to conquer the Blue Planet, Rosmandi would be their first target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine family in Newport City would likely be their first casualty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they took down Newport, there wouldn't be any superpowers left in Rosmandi to challenge the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All the superpowers, Ancient Families, wealthy clans, and even ordinary folks in Rosmandi will be forced to submit to the Deschanel Clan! Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne seethed, his eyes blazing with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Hearin City was still grappling with the onslaught of the Beast Tide, and the thirty-six Deschanel deities could easily quell the chaos if they chose to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, they stood idly by, allowing the innocent people of Hearin City to suffer and die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Joseph had coldly stated, the people of Hearin City were merely mortals. Their deaths were inconsequential. By letting the Dark Deities wreak havoc, the Deschanel Clan aimed to instill fear and despair. When they finally swooped in to save the day, how grateful would the mortals be? How could they not worship and submit to their new gods?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deschanel Clan was deliberately allowing the Beast Tide to claim more victims, all to establish their dominance when they finally intervened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes burned with murderous intent. He longed to strike down all thirty-six of the Deschanel family gods to put an end to their arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he knew he couldn't act on that desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his current strength, Osborne was simply outmatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weakest among the Deschanel deities possessed a Level Two Divine Body, while six of them were Superior Deities with Level Three Divine Bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leading them was Joseph, who boasted a Level Four Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was just a Junior Deity. Facing any of the Superior Deities from the Deschanel Clan was a daunting prospect, let alone taking down all thirty-six of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The odds were stacked against him, and the danger was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mind raced with urgency. "I can't just sit back and wait for the Deschanel Clan's gods to get a grip on the situation. Once they do, they'll inevitably turn their sights on the Augustine family in Newport City. With our current strength, facing off against thirty-six gods from the Deschanel Clan would mean total annihilation! I need to boost our power&mdash;fast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew it wasn't just about him; he had to strengthen not only the Blood Demon members but also the Draco Armed Services Branch and the Augustine family itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I want to stand a chance against the Deschanel Clan's thirty-six gods, I have to enhance mu power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, we'll be crushed, enslaved, and turned into mere pawns of the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right now, my own strength isn't enough to take them on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if I rallied all the Blood Demon members, we'd still be outmatched. Even if they all reached peak Class S, they'd barely hold their own against a group of Junior Deities. And sure, a few Intermediate Deities might be manageable, but a Superior Deity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's a whole different ballgame! Sure, sheer numbers can make a difference&mdash;like ants taking down an elephant&mdash;but when the power gap is that vast, it's a losing battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if all the Blood Demon members banded together, they wouldn't stand a chance against a Superior Deity. They'd be wiped out in no time! That's simply unacceptable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The best course of action right now is to buy some time. I need to divert Deschanel Clan's attention away from the Augustine family so they won't strike immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I can just hold them off long enough, I can continue to strengthen myself and my allies until we're ready to face them head-on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But how do I stall for time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne clenched his fists, determination flooding his veins.</span></p><div class="pagination">
