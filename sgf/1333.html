  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp command cut through the chaos, halting every Dark Deity soldier and the warriors of the Pantheon League and </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization in their tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd parted slowly, revealing a towering figure with a menacing visage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the leader of this malevolent army&mdash;Apocalypse Harbinger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold smile, Apocalypse Harbinger surveyed the battered remnants of Lord League and the Prophet Alliance, all that remained of their once-mighty forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord League, your time is up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your Dimensional Microcosm has been obliterated, and now only a handful of you are left. Do you really want to keep fighting? I can offer you a chance to live. Submit to the Dark Deity Legion and the great Lord Malevolence. Not only will I spare your </span><span>lives, but I can grant you land in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, along with the support of the Dark Deity Legion, to help you grow and thrive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bow down, and you won't just survive&mdash;you'll become stronger than ever before!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, Eliot, the leader of Lord League, felt his heart sink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The warriors behind him exchanged glances, their expressions shifting to one of uncertainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a voice rang out, cutting through the tension&mdash;a voice filled with rage and determination. It was Eddie from the Prophet Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! You think we'll submit to you? You're dreaming!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're the Dark Deity, and we are the divine protectors of humanity! </span><span>You're</span><span> invaders, the very enemies who seek to destroy our home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Betray our kind and bow to you? Not a chance! Even if it costs us our lives, we will never submit to you Dark Deities! We won't be your dogs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words ignited a fire in the hearts of his comrades. A dozen or so warriors from the Prophet Alliance glared defiantly at Apocalypse Harbinger, their eyes burning with resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would rather die than surrender!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apocalypse Harbinger regarded them with a chilling smile. "Ah, my dear Prophet Alliance, I'm not addressing you right now! Even if you wanted to submit, I wouldn't accept it. My question is directed solely at Lord League."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed his gaze on Eliot. "So, what's it going to be, Lord League?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you going to follow the Prophet Alliance's example and choose death over submission? If that's your decision, I'll gladly order your complete annihilation. I will wipe your lineage from existence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliot's face twisted with hesitation and turmoil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie's expression darkened at the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eliot, don't make a foolish choice! We are the protectors of humanity! How can we betray our own kind and submit to the Dark Deity who invades our world?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it means death, then so be it! We've lived for centuries&mdash;what's a little more time? If I fall, a thousand others will rise to defend humanity and drive out these cursed Dark Deities!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You cannot agree to this! If you submit, you'll be a traitor to your people! Your name, and the name of Lord League, will be forever etched on a monument of shame!" Eddie shouted, desperation lacing his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliot's face grew even more conflicted and agonized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this moment of utter despair, Apocalypse Harbinger let out a mirthless chuckle, his eyes boring into Eliot's soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eliot, you're not really buying into his nonsense, are you? Whether we're the Dark Deities or you human gods, we're all the same here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At the end of the day, we're all just beings of wisdom in this vast universe. In essence, there's not much difference. Moreover, Eddie dares to be so noble because the root of the Prophet Alliance doesn't lie here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if Eddie and his crew perish, the Prophet Alliance won't completely cease to exist. But you're different. If all of you die, Lord League will truly be no more!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a sardonic smirk, Apocalypse Harbinger continued, "Truth be told, I couldn't care less about your strength. Whether you bow or not, it makes no difference to me. I'm just giving you one last chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What choice did you make? That's entirely up to you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Surrender, and not only do you live, but you'll grow stronger than ever before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Resist, and you face extinction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll give you ten seconds to decide."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He crossed his arms, looking utterly nonchalant. "After ten seconds, if you don't choose to submit, I'll order the assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apocalypse Harbinger began to count down slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eliot's face was drained of color, his expression a tangled mess of hesitation and struggle. On one hand, he could submit to the Dark Deities, betraying humanity and becoming humanity's traitor. On the other hand, he faced death or even extinction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was he to choose?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the remaining survivors of Lord League watched Eliot with bated breath, awaiting his decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Four."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apocalypse Harbinger continued his countdown, his voice akin to a death knell, shattering whatever tenuous resolve Eliot had left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his eyes closed, Eliot finally spoke, "We of Lord League, are willing to submit."</span></p><div class="pagination">
