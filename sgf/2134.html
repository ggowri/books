  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Osborne was lost in thoughts of the Sacred Artifact-level palace, a powerful attack suddenly hurtled toward them. His Satan's Eye blared a warning, snapping him back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression hardened in an instant. Without a moment's hesitation, Osborne yanked Alfreda out of harm's way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spot where they had just been standing erupted in a blinding flash of light, leaving a massive crater behind, surrounded by charred earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne hadn't reacted as quickly as he did, they would have surely been hit, and even if they </span><span>had </span><span>survived, serious injuries would have been inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force of that attack was more than enough to annihilate most Ascension Six Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face paled as he hastily turned to scan the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chaos reigned around them. On one side was Uriel, leading a powerful exploration team with nearly a hundred members&mdash;all no weaker than Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, there were five at Ascension Six, and, of course, Uriel himself at Ascension Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing them </span><span>was</span><span> </span><span>a group of humanoid beings with blue skin, all equally formidable, all at Ascension Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the forefront, one particular challenger clashed furiously with Uriel, clearly at Ascension Seven as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two Ascension Seven Supernal Deity Kings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart sank as he locked eyes on Uriel and his opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attack that had just targeted them was incredibly powerful. It was far beyond what any Ascension Six warrior could muster. Among those present, only Uriel and his opponent had the strength to launch such a devastating strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, it had to be one of these two who had just launched a sneak attack on him and Alfreda!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't take long for Osborne to figure out the culprit. The power signatures of Uriel and his opponent were like night and day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel's attacks were imbued with a divine energy signature. He seemed like a god, enveloped in a halo of holy light as he wielded the terrifying power of light elemental, pushing his opponent firmly onto the back foot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, his opponent was struggling to hold his ground, controlling the power of </span><span>the </span><span>dark elements to fend off Uriel's onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the attack that had just hit them? It was a blast of light-elemental energy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was Uriel!" Osborne cursed, a storm of emotions twisting in his gut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was crystal clear that Uriel was the one who had launched the sneak attack on him and Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He wants us dead?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's expression mirrored his horror as realization hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shot a furious glare at Uriel. "There's no doubt! He wants to kill us!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uriel's aim is clearly this Sacred Artifact-level palace! The value of this place is astronomical; he'll never allow anyone to covet it! He wouldn't even want word of its existence getting out.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if he secures the palace for now, trouble will rain down on him if others learn of it! No matter how high-ranked he is in the Ethereal Elven Temple as the Third Oracle Heir, he won't be able to hold on to it!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, he's planning to take us out while we're distracted by the palace, ensuring we can't contest him for it or spread the news!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Alfreda laid out her thoughts, a grim understanding washed over Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hissed, his face hardening, "What a treacherous move!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> the moment we stepped inside and laid eyes on the palace, we were marked for death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda affirmed, her body tense, fingers tightening around her Arcane Staff of Nature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He won't let us leave alive! We've become his enemies simply by witnessing too much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a resounding crash echoed through the air as Uriel forcefully repelled his adversary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then turned his piercing gaze toward Osborne and Alfreda, an arrogant smile appearing on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Princess Alfreda? What a surprise to see you here! You shouldn't have come! I never intended to kill you, but now that you've seen what you shouldn't have, there's nothing </span><span>left for you but death here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, a chilling malice flickered in Uriel's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An immense pressure crashed down on Osborne and Alfreda, causing both of them to shift uncomfortably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such power!" Osborne thought, his heart racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel was an Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King, and not just any Ascension Seven. A millennium ago, he had been the First Oracle Heir of the Ethereal Elven Temple, capable of battling the geniuses of the Sacred Dragon Clan. Though he had been defeated, his talent was undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, after returning from the cycle of reincarnation, Uriel had not only regained his memories but had also become even more formidable. In less than a century, he had ascended to Ascension Seven, his strength far exceeding that of a typical warrior at this level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer force of his aura made Osborne and Alfreda feel as though they were struggling to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged glances, but there was no fear or retreat in their eyes&mdash;only a fierce determination to fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda </span><span>scoffed,</span><span> her voice icy. "Uriel, how dare you ambush us! Isn't that a bit underhanded? As the Oracle Heir of the Ethereal Elven Temple, you're attacking two who are beneath you in cultivation level? Ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She </span><span>spat,</span><span> her disdain palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel merely sneered in response. "Ambush? Hardly! I was just going to crush two insignificant ants without a second thought! But I must admit, I didn't expect you to dodge my attack while you were distracted.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your strength is... surprising. It seems you've both come into some significant fortune that boosted your power.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But even so, you'll still die!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This Sacred Artifact-level palace belongs to me! Now that you've seen it, you have to die! I can't trust you to keep quiet.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Compared to these Umbra World creatures standing in my way, you're the real threat! After all, those creatures won't spill a word!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Uriel wore a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, he swung his hand. "You should just die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his words hung in the air, a blinding beam of light erupted toward Osborne and Alfreda, moving with terrifying speed, faster and more deadly than the previous attack. In an instant, it was upon them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's heart raced with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt her body freeze, an invisible force emanating from Uriel's gaze, binding her in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gasped, panic rising, "I can't move!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Prison of Radiant Light! The Light Elf Clan's deadly forbidden technique!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's eyes widened in horror as glowing orbs floated around her, connecting and forming a prison that ensnared both her and Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Breaking free would take time&mdash;time they didn't have.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Uriel wasn't about to grant them any of that. Waves of deadly light shot toward them, intent on piercing through their defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was too fast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda could only watch in dread as the powerful beams surged toward her, a sense of impending doom flooding her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a cold grunt broke through her despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Osborne, his voice cutting through the tension like a knife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, the luminous orbs surrounding Alfreda began to shatter one by one, disintegrating into nothingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt the rush of freedom return to her limbs.</span></p><div class="pagination">
