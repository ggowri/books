It could very well be you," Valentin retorted coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took in the sight of the Viper Squad behind Apollo and felt a tightening in his chest. The aura of menace radiating from them was overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the head of Skyefall Security, he could immediately tell that the Viper Squad members were seasoned veterans, each having likely taken numerous lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their equipment was state-of-the-art, crafted by a top foreign arms manufacturer. The firepower they wielded was immense, rivaling that of the Draco Group's Class C combat suits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fortunately, we've upgraded our gear as well. Out of our thirty-man team, ten are equipped with Class B suits, and the rest have Class C gear. We definitely have the advantage in terms of equipment," Valentin thought, feeling somewhat reassured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a crucial battle for Skyefall Security, so Valentin spared no expense. Out of the thirty deployed, two were chosen by Osborne, while the rest were meticulously selected by Valentin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top brass of Skyefall Security were all in the field.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, only Valentin had Class B combat capability, with three at Class C+ and ten at Class C. The rest were all at Class D+.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was already a formidable force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, after seeing Apollo and the Viper Squad, Valentin realized that in terms of raw combat strength, Chevalier Security's team was superior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every member of the Viper Squad gave off the aura of at least a Class C fighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did he find so many top-tier fighters?" Valentin wondered, worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hope our equipment advantage can compensate for the difference in individual strength. Otherwise, our chances of winning might be less than thirty percent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin glanced at the time with growing anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why aren't they here yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, two figures appeared in the distance, a man and a woman, walking side by side. They were in basic gear but wore Skyefall Security's uniforms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin's eyes lit up, and he rushed towards them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at the man with a mixture of surprise and uncertainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine? Is that you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly and nodded. "Valentin, it's me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was wearing a mask that made him look like a middle-aged man, so even Valentin couldn't recognize him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned in and whispered, "The strength of Chevalier Security is more than I anticipated. We might be in serious trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? Is that so?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow and turned to the woman beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman took a casual glance at Apollo and his team, her face remaining utterly composed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One metahuman in Class B and four in Class C+; six martial artists in Class C+, and the rest are Class C. Their strength is indeed impressive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he could sense the general strength of Apollo's team, he couldn't assess it with such clarity. He stared at the woman, amazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, who is she?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "She is the Night Witch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Night Witch?" Valentin echoed, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The name rang a bell, but he couldn't quite place it. Ultimately, he decided not to dwell on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't elaborate further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was his ace in the hole. His confidence in betting the entire Skyefall Security against Apollo was because of her presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, even with Isa, Osborne couldn't afford to be careless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced over at Apollo and his team, activating his Satan's Eye to scrutinize them carefully, a look of surprise crossing his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong?" Valentin asked, noticing Osborne's expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned. "Many of them are cyborgs. Their bones and flesh have been extensively modified with mechanical parts. They won't be easy to deal with."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cyborgs?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin was shocked, his brow furrowing tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that cybernetic enhancements could significantly boost a person's speed, defense, and strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Class C individual upgraded this way could match a Class C+ fighter, and a Class C+ could reach Class B.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was daunting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne hadn't warned them, they might have been caught off guard. But even knowing this in advance didn't help much. They were already at a disadvantage, and the enhancements only widened the gap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne felt the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder Apollo is so confident. With such a powerful team, the outcome will only be clear after the fight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew he would have to reveal some of his true capabilities and secret weapons to stand a chance of winning this battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you ready yet?" Apollo's impatient voice called out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Valentin, since your people are all here, let's get started! The sooner I defeat you, the sooner I can take over Skyefall Security."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin took a deep breath, trying to quell his anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Cut the crap. Let's begin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo's eyes gleamed with excitement. "Finally, it's time? Let's do this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Begin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Apollo led the Viper Squad, charging swiftly into the ring-shaped canyon towards the central flag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and his team were not far behind, entering from another side of the canyon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flag-capturing battle had begun!</span></p><div class="pagination">
