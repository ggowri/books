  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne spoke indifferently to Gavin, "You claim the true master behind the Hummingbird Gang is the ancient Luther family? What evidence do you have? It seems you're trying to intimidate me with the name of the Luther family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could a family as esteemed as the Luther family support an underground gang in committing so many heinous crimes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin replied coldly, "That's the truth! Believe it or not. In fact, it's not just the Hummingbird Gang; many underground gangs are under the control of the Luther family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In every city across </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, there are underground gangs supported by the Luther family, doing the dirty work they're unwilling to do themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For instance, not long ago, a member of the Luther family was injured and needed a heart transplant. They ordered the Hummingbird Gang to kidnap a matching donor overnight, and they brutally removed his heart to replace the one in the Luther family member.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Luther family can't do such things themselves, so they rely on underground gangs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned extremely grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin, however, mistook his look for fear and sneered, "In any case, the Luther family's power in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> is absolutely beyond your imagination, and it's not something you can challenge! If you dare to harm me, the Luther family will not let you off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said coldly, "Very well! Make a call to the Luther family. I want to ask them if they really supported the Hummingbird Gang in committing such outrageous acts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin was taken aback. "Aren't you afraid of death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said indifferently, "I said make the call! Right now. Otherwise, you can die right here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin's face darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, fine! You're asking for it. I hope you won't regret it when the Luther family arrives!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he made the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His demeanor was extremely respectful and cautious, even ingratiating. From his conversation, Osborne deduced that he was speaking to Wallace, the heir of the Luther family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wallace berated Gavin over the phone for not being able to handle such a trivial matter and having to involve him personally, scolding Gavin until he was sweating profusely and could only keep apologizing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, Wallace promised to come as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin let out a long sigh of relief and looked at Osborne coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You wait. Mr. Wallace Luther, the heir of the Luther family, will be here in person soon! When he arrives, you're done for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mocked, "Kevin said the same thing earlier. He said once you arrived, I would be the one finished. But in the end, it was you who was finished."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin's face flushed with embarrassment and anger, and he snorted coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's different this time! Mr. Luther is a true big shot, one of the future masters of </span><span>Dampston</span><span>. Among the younger generation, only Alexander Paltrow could match his strength. He could break through into Class A at any time. In short, you're as good as dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Only Alexander could compare to Wallace among the younger generation? Why did I hear that Alexander had been killed? And even the Paltrow family has been wiped out. What does that make Wallace?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin's face changed, looking at Osborne in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're well-informed, knowing that Alexander was killed. But Alexander was killed by Osborne, the heir of the Augustine family. What does that have to do with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gavin looked proud. "Mr. Wallace Luther may not be as good as Osborne, but teaching you a lesson will be like a game!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged. "Really? Then let's see if Wallace can teach me a lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, he ignored Gavin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pondered for a moment and made a call to Nathan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what do you need from me?" Nathan was very excited, his voice full of fervor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nathan, I want you to investigate all the underground gangs in </span><span>Dampston</span><span> for me. Find out their backgrounds, who they rely on, and the crimes they've committed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan asked in confusion, "Osborne, why are you investigating these underground gangs? Did they offend you? These gangs dare not appear openly. They shouldn't have offended </span><span>you,</span><span> I think."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said coldly, "You don't need to care about that. Just investigate as quickly as possible, especially those forcing women into prostitution, human trafficking, and trading in human organs. Each must be investigated thoroughly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sensing Osborne's seriousness, Nathan immediately became severe as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'll get on it! There are at least several hundred underground gangs of some scale in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>. It might take me some time to investigate them all thoroughly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get it done in three days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Osborne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hung up the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't avoid Gavin while making the call. At this moment, Gavin's face was full of uncertainty and fear as he looked at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who were you just talking to on the phone? Nathan? Which Nathan? You're going to investigate all the underground gangs in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>? What do you want to do? Do you want to wipe out all the underground gangs? Who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Want to know who I am? Don't worry. You'll find out soon enough! As for whether I want to wipe out all the underground gangs, that depends on how much evil they've done!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they've done little, I might spare them. If they've done a lot... then they'll have to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne finished coldly, then looked at the little girl selling flowers, ignoring the terrified Gavin.</span></p><div class="pagination">
