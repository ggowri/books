  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, Osborne had viewed both the God of Night and Lord Malevolence as untouchable figures, far beyond his reach. He couldn't even summon the will to fight against them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, that feeling had vanished completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having ascended to the rank of Supernal Deity King, even if he was just at Ascension One, he stood at the same cultivation level as the God of Night and Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all Supernal Deity Kings, after all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, the God of Night and Lord Malevolence might be at Ascension Seven or even Ascension Eight, but to Osborne, they no longer seemed so lofty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had just taken down Icy Nine, an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he continued to grow stronger, it wouldn't be long before he stood shoulder to shoulder with the God of Night and Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I might not be able to defeat Lord Malevolence! I might not be inferior to the God of Night!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these thoughts igniting a fire within him, Osborne felt an overwhelming urge to prove to everyone that he, too, could save the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he knew he wasn't quite there yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Buying time, huh? Perfect! I need that time to keep growing! Just give me a little while longer, and it won't matter if it's the Dark Deity Legion, the Paramount Supreme Clan, or even the God of Night... I'll crush them all beneath my feet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glint of determination flashed in Osborne's eyes. He said nothing more, diving into the memories of Bram and Trevor, quickly sifting through them to uncover evidence of the Baxter family's betrayal of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't take long before Osborne found what he was looking for, his eyes lighting up with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So that's it! I've got the evidence now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured to himself before rapidly scanning through both of their memories once more, then finally paused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro watched him intently, a spark of anticipation in his gaze. "Did you figure it out? Did you find proof of the Baxter family's betrayal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded with a smile. "I found it! And it's not just the Baxter family; the Faulkner family is involved too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Faulkner family?!" Jethro's face shifted, shock washing over him. "I can't believe the Faulkner family has betrayed the Human Community as well! What did they do? Is the evidence solid?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, you should see for yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sealed the organized memories directly into Jethro's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his eyes closed, Jethro quickly reviewed the information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he opened them again, they blazed with fury and murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro gritted his teeth, rage boiling within him. "The Baxter family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Faulkner family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They deserve to die! They conspired to kill the esteemed God of Light! Thank goodness she was cautious and never gave them a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could they be so vile? If it weren't for the esteemed God of Light protecting the Human Community in the West Zone for all these years, we would have been enslaved by the Paramount Supreme Clan long ago, reduced to mere lowly slaves!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And they dared to plot against her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, the accomplishments they claimed on the battlefield were all a sham!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They were in cahoots with the Dark Deity Legion, putting on a show for us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those warriors who supposedly died on the border battlefield didn't actually perish! They were just pretending! Can you believe it? There are nearly a hundred warriors from both families who faked their deaths, and they're still hiding in the West Zone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes gleamed with cold resolve. "I can't wait any longer! I need to see the esteemed God of Light right now! I'm going to urge her to take action and eliminate them all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly stepped in front of Jethro, urgency in his voice. "Grandpa, there's no need to involve the God of Light in this. Let me handle it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro's expression shifted instantly, concern etched on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You? Are you out of your mind? That's way too dangerous! There are nearly a hundred Supernal Deity Kings from the Baxter and Faulkner families over there! They've had years to gather resources from the Paramount Supreme Clan and have all become Supernal Deity Kings themselves&mdash;there's even one at Ascension Four and more than five at Ascension Three! Who besides the God of Light could take them on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly, confidence radiating from him, "But Grandpa, the Hudson family has that kind of power now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro paused, taken aback. "We have that kind of power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied, his enthusiasm growing, "Absolutely! While you've been at the Sanctum of Light for just a few days, time has accelerated two hundredfold in Hudson Valley. Years have passed! The Hudson family's strength has transformed completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We now have nearly two hundred Supernal Deity Kings, and our Deity Kings at the peak level have surpassed 50 thousand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And that number keeps climbing! The Hudson family is fully capable of wiping out the Baxter and Faulkner families! Since we've confirmed their betrayal against the Human Community, why should we rely on the God of Light to deal with them? We can handle this ourselves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro's eyes lit up at Osborne's words. "So you're suggesting that we, the Hudson family, take care of the Human Community traitors ourselves?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded firmly. "Exactly! What's more, the God of Light has a lot on her plate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no need for her to shoulder every burden!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Hudson family has the strength to take on more responsibility. Before the full-scale war begins, it's our duty to deal with traitors like the Baxter and Faulkner families!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro's excitement was palpable now. "You're right, Osborne! In the past, we didn't have the strength to confront the Baxter and Faulkner families, even when we discovered their betrayal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We had to rely on the esteemed God of Light to handle them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now, we have that power. There's no need to trouble her anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We, the Hudson family, will personally eliminate the traitors of the Human Community! Let's go back right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, "Aren't you going to report this good news to the God of Light?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro grinned. "This is urgent! With Bram dead, those traitors might get suspicious and relocate immediately! We can't let them escape, especially not the Baxter and Faulkner families!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once I've taken care of those two traitors, I'll report back to the esteemed God of Light. By then, we'll have even more evidence, and no one will be able to argue with us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With adrenaline pumping, Jethro was ready for action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro had long been irritated by the Baxter and Faulkner families, and now that they had concrete proof of their betrayal, he couldn't hold back any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Osborne led Jethro back to Hudson Valley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gather all the Supernal Deity Kings of the Hudson family for an emergency meeting!" Jethro commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, nearly two hundred Supernal Deity Kings from the Hudson family filled the conference room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro quickly recounted how Bram had ambushed him and explained the situation regarding the Baxter and Faulkner families' betrayal of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room erupted with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro declared, "Now, we need to act immediately! We must eliminate every last one of those hidden powerhouses from the Baxter and Faulkner families!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And we need to send teams to corner them&mdash;there's no way any traitor gets away!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
