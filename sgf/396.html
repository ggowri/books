  <div class="container"><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander couldn&#x27;t help but frown when he heard it, &quot;The Aberrants asked us to send the masters to cooperate with them in their attack on the Maritime Auction of the Draco Group, right? Well, that wasn&#x27;t what they said when they agreed to cooperate with us at first!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;We had promised to cooperate with them when they made a big push into Skyefall and Dampston, but now they want us to attack in advance.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;In case we are exposed, the Paltrow family will be screwed.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Our Paltrow family won&#x27;t do nothing without benefit.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander looked upset.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Wade also looked annoyed. &quot;We&#x27;ll truly have a risk of being exposed, but as long as we&#x27;re careful, we&#x27;ll be fine. After all, the Aberrants are the main force, and we&#x27;re just sending a few people to assist them.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Besides, it&#x27;s not entirely unhelpful to us.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander raised his eyebrows. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;If the Aberrants destroy the Maritime Auction of the Draco Group this time, they will destroy the reputation of the Draco Group and accelerate the return of the Aberrants to Rosmandi. We are in partnership with the Aberrants, so as soon as the Aberrants return to Rosmandi, we will gain a lot of benefits by following them.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;As long as the Aberrants defeat the Draco Group and become the king of the underworld in Rosmandi again, the Paltrow family will definitely be the most favored ancient family. At that time, the Paltrow family will become one of the most powerful ancient families in Rosmandi.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Speaking of which, Wade looked incredibly excited and expectant.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He looked at Alexander. &quot;Alexander, you are planning to ask the Paltrow family, the Luther family, and the Walker family to join hands to eliminate the other six ancient families in Dampston first. Then, we will team up to handle the Luther family, the Walker family, so that the Paltrow family will dominate all the interests in Dampston and become the hegemon of the Dampston.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander nodded with a proud look on his face.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The plan was indeed proposed by Alexander, and he was promoting to carry it out.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was his ambition to make the Paltrow family the dominant force in Dampston.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Wade continued, &quot;Alexander, you&#x27;re still young, but you&#x27;re too short-sighted. Are you just satisfied with making the Paltrow family the dominant force in Dampston?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;There are fifty provinces in Rosmandi!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Although Dampston is not the most backward province, it is definitely not at the top of the list. It&#x27;s just a bit better than Skyefall, which is on the border of Rosmandi.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Are you just satisfied with us becoming the dominant power in Dampston? You can be more ambitious. The Paltrow family will belong to you anyway, so you should lead us out of Dampston to conquer a wider area!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;We could even become the most powerful ancient family in Rosmandi like the Augustine family in Newport City, spreading our influence throughout the fifty provinces of Rosmandi!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;The Augustine family in Newport City could do it because they had Godfather, but we have Alexander. Why can&#x27;t you be the next Godfather?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;It&#x27;s dangerous to work with the Aberrants, but the more dangerous it is, the greater the benefits. If we handle it well, the Aberrants can also be a weapon in our hands, clearing the way for us.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Therefore, we must cooperate with the Aberrants.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">When Wade finished speaking, Alexander opened his mouth slightly, looking shocked.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He had thought he was being ambitious enough.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Unexpectedly, Wade was more ambitious than Alexander was. Wade was going to use the Aberrants as a weapon in his hands, clearing the way for the Paltrow family to become the most powerful ancient family in Rosmandi, while Alexander...</p><p style="text-align:left;">Would he be the next Godfather?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Did Wade want him to be the Godfather?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander admitted that even though he had been confident since he was a little boy, he had never dared to think such a thing, but now that Wade had said it, he was suddenly breathing quickly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Who wouldn&#x27;t want to be the Godfather?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Who wouldn&#x27;t want to be as powerful as Godfather?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander wanted it the same!</p><p style="text-align:left;">He burst into hot tears and said excitedly, &quot;Wade, can we really do this? I think the power of the Paltrow family is still too weak.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Wade sneered, &quot;It&#x27;s true that we are weak now, but we won&#x27;t be later. Back then, Godfather also rose from his weakest point, so why can&#x27;t you do what he could do? If he could have a meteoric rise, why can&#x27;t you?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Don&#x27;t forget that you&#x27;ve got a chance to rise quickly now!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander was stunned and said suddenly, &quot;Wade, are you talking about Clarissa? Is it the fate power from Clarissa?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Wade nodded. &quot;That&#x27;s right!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;The fate power from Clarissa is your chance to rise quickly. As long as you can withstand her fate power and endure her attacks, according to that great prophet&#x27;s prediction, you will surely have a meteoric rise!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;By then, the Aberrants and the Draco Group will both lose, and we&#x27;ll gather our power in secret, so we&#x27;re bound to defeat them in the end.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;When the time comes, you&#x27;ll be the next Godfather!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander&#x27;s breathing became more rapid, his eyes filled with eager anticipation.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Wade, I know what I have to do.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You&#x27;re right. If Godfather can rise from his weakest, why can&#x27;t I? I can&#x27;t wait to marry Clarissa and suffer the pain from the fate power in her!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I will definitely be the next Godfather!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Seeing that Alexander was excited, Wade couldn&#x27;t help but nod in satisfaction.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Great, it&#x27;s nice that you have that confidence.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;But it&#x27;s not the right time for you to marry Clarissa. You can&#x27;t marry her until you&#x27;ve adjusted your state to the best and enhanced your power to the peak, so as not to be avenged by the fate power.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You just have to wait for eighteen days!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;It will be your chance to change in eighteen days!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Now all we have to do is assist the Aberrants to disrupt the Maritime Auction by the Draco Group in cooperation with the Augustine family.&quot;</p><div class="pagination">
