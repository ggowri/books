  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The massive voice echoed in Osborne's mind, leaving him dizzy and disoriented. His Soul Current Ocean rippled violently, even slowing </span><span>his </span><span>speed</span><span> to</span><span> react, allowing the opponent to close the gap further.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's face looked grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This person claimed that as long as Osborne handed over the Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, he wouldn't kill him. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In reality, he launched a Soul Attack on Osborne. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne's Soul Current Ocean </span><span>were not</span><span> strong and stable enough, with the Primordial and Warfare Ancient Tree fused within, holding the fort, he might have already fallen for it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This person never intended to let him live!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clenched his teeth, quickly thinking of a </span><span>way out</span><span>, his heart filled with urgency.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because Osborne knew that the person w</span><span>as not entirely wrong</span><span>. He had indeed burned his blood essence, doubling his speed. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this rate, within a dozen </span><span>second</span><span>s, th</span><span>at person</span><span> really could catch up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What to do?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't think of a solution for the moment. If he were caught by this Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, he'd be in big trouble. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With his current strength, even with Flash, he was definitely no match for the opponent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if he summoned Drum and all of Drum's pets, they might still not be a match.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne wasn't particularly anxious at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because he still had his final trump card &mdash; Drum of Empress Kira!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Empress Kira said that as long as I take good care of Drum, she will ensure my safety! If it really comes down to a life-and-death situation, Empress Kira should appear to save me! And with Empress Kira's strength...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A mere Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection</span><span> </span><span>should </span><span>mean nothing to her</span><span>, right? But Empress Kira almost exhausted all her strength to nurture Drum and </span><span>was</span><span> now in slumber... </span><span>Unless </span><span>necessary, it's better not to disturb her!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I must find a way to solve it myself!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne continu</span><span>ed</span><span> to run desperately, but he could clearly feel the person behind him getting closer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, that person's voice echoed in Osborne's mind again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kid, it seems you're unwilling to surrender! In that case, don't blame me for being ruthless! Once I catch you, I'll make you regret being alive! </span><span>You made me</span><span> burn </span><span>my </span><span>blood essence, you're dead for sure!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, the person</span><span> sped up</span><span> once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt even more pressure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, Osborne suddenly felt that </span><span>there was something unusual in the environment.</span><span> </span><span>It felt</span><span> much stickier, </span><span>as if</span><span> a strange force </span><span>was </span><span>pulling </span><span>at him</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Huh? What's going on?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very surprised and immediately looked in the direction of the pulling force. Then, his mouth dropped open, his face full of shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What did he see?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He saw a surging, rolling river rushing into the distance. The river was so immense that its width and length were impossible to discern, like a massive, radiant ribbon spanning across the deep space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And everything around seemed to be drawn to it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those small Chrono-Spatial Turbulences, originally heading in different directions, were now drawn to it, eventually converging </span><span>into a single flow</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>An immensely massive Chrono-Spatial Turbulence!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>A</span><span> Chrono-Spatial Turbulence</span><span> this </span><span>massive?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned. He had been to deep space many times and spent quite a while there, but he had never seen such a massive and terrifying Chrono-Spatial Turbulence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the Chrono-Spatial Turbulence where the Warfare Ancient Tree was discovered wasn't one-tenth the size of this one.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It might not even be one percent!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at this Chrono-Spatial Turbulence, Osborne actually felt a sense of dread. Even with his spatial power, he was terrified of those frightening temporal-spatial waves.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kid! I advise you not to go over there!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Primordial spoke, "This Chrono-Spatial Turbulence is not something you can enter! If you go in, you might be torn apart instantly! If I'm not mistaken, this is... a Chrono-Spatial Turbulence leading to the depths of the universe!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It is called&mdash;the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was instantly shocked upon hearing this. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A Chrono-Spatial Turbulence leading to the depths of the universe? Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign? Are you sure?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial nodded solemnly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm sure! You </span><span>already</span><span> know this cosmos is vast and immense, and it's still expanding every moment. Even the strongest beings find it nearly impossible to traverse the cosmos, from its edge to its depths... because it's just too far!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Crossing the cosmos to reach the depths of the universe is indeed nearly impossible! But isn't there the Cosmic Translocator? With a powerful Cosmic Translocator, </span><span>we</span><span> can directly teleport to the depths of the universe."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial sneered upon hearing this, "Cosmic Translocator? It&rsquo;s indeed an option, but </span><span>till </span><span>too difficult! The Cosmic Translocator requires energy to operate! The farther the distance, the greater the energy needed! The deeper into the universe you teleport, the more immense the energy required..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you know how much energy it takes to teleport from the Racial Convergence Planet to the depths of the universe?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How much?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was curious; he truly didn&rsquo;t know and guessed randomly, "Could it be a hundred million Sacred Crystals? Or more? A billion? Ten billion?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt that his guess was already quite </span><span>outrageous</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Primordial sneered, "A hundred million? A billion? Ten billion? You're too naive! With ten billion Sacred Crystals, you can't even teleport out of the outer edge of the universe! You can't even reach the mid-layer of the universe..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"To teleport to the mid-layer of the universe... even if you burn the entire Racial Convergence Planet to ashes, turning it all into power... and then burn countless surrounding medium, small, and even tiny life-bearing planets and resource-bearing planets into energy... it still might not be enough!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And to use the Cosmic Translocator to teleport to the depths of the universe... you'd need to burn </span><span>all the matter</span><span> in dozens of Stellar Regions at the very least to possibly succeed! </span><span>You</span><span> might even r</span><span>need to burn all the matter</span><span> in hundreds of Stellar Regions!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even so, </span><span>only</span><span> one person </span><span>could be sent </span><span>into the depths of the universe! Under such circumstances, do you think you can use the Cosmic Translocator to reach the depths of the universe?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon hearing this</span><span>, Osborne was completely stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Burning all the matter on the Racial Convergence Planet and even the surrounding planets </span><span>just to </span><span>teleport to the mid-layer of the universe? </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Burning the matter of dozens, or even hundreds, of Stellar Regions just to teleport one person to the depths of the universe?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>T</span><span>his </span><span>was </span><span>too </span><span>insane</span><span>!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But thinking about the vastness of the universe, Osborne suddenly felt that perhaps this isn't </span><span>an exaggeration</span><span> but a fact!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If not for the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign, almost no one could enter the depths of the universe from its outskirts! But fortunately, in deep space, there is the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Entering the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign gives a chance to move directly from the outskirts of the universe to the mid-layer, or even to its deepest parts! </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>But </span><span>it's only a possibility because... the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign is incredibly dangerous, and those without sufficient strength will undoubtedly die inside!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And the reason it's called the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign... is because only Imperial Empyrean Sacredness warriors can enter and survive within the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"With your current strength, </span><span>and your</span><span> spatial power and time powers, </span><span>you are as good as dead if you </span><span>recklessly enter </span><span>it</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, stay away from the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign immediately!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Primordial finished speaking, Osborne's face turned extremely grim. Hearing </span><span>this</span><span>, Osborne became deeply fearful of the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign, and he had no desire to </span><span>get an closer to </span><span>it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection warrior behind him </span><span>would soon catch</span><span> up! </span><span>His </span><span>terrifying killing intent had completely enveloped Osborne...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What to do?!</span></p><div class="pagination">
