  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the Abyssal Planet was discovered, explorers only conducted some basic exploration and gathered some data.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The items on the list in Osborne's hand had all been discovered before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Dark Mandala grows deep within the volcano.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's just that there are too many volcanoes here. Even with Satan's Eye, Osborne searched hundreds of volcanoes in a row but still found nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation is obviously odd.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but stop.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Could it be that the outer areas of the volcanic region don't have the Dark Mandala, and they all grow in the center of the volcanic region? The temperature there is higher, and the environment is harsher. Even warriors with Empyrean Sacredness would struggle to survive there without fire-resistance methods."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, I'm not afraid! But Abyssal Planet not only has a harsh environment but also some dangerous native creatures. Just because I haven't encountered them yet doesn't mean they don't exist in the depths of the volcanic region.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Whatever, I'll head to the central area first and see!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne decided to abandon the step-by-step search method and go straight to the center of the volcanic region to look for the Dark Mandala.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he still couldn't find it, Osborne would have to consider changing his target. Although the Dark Mandala is highly valuable, if it's too scarce, searching for it wouldn't be worth the effort.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, Osborne didn't use spatial power. The dense volcanic ash and smoke in the depths of the volcanic region made it impossible for his Satan's Eye to see far. Using interdimensional travel under such conditions could easily lead to teleporting directly into the volcano or other dangerous environments.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's Sacred Power surged, shielding his body as he swiftly charged into the dense volcanic ash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The temperature rose rapidly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne realized he had underestimated the temperature of the volcanic region. The dense volcanic ash and smoke trapped the heat of the erupting lava, preventing it from dissipating and causing the temperature to keep rising.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Osborne noticed his Sacred Power starting to sizzle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The terrifying temperature caused his Sacred Power defense to waver.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Good thing my Sacred Power is fused with fire power. Plus, I've ignited the Dark Phoenix Flame. No matter how high the temperature gets, it can't hurt me. If it were someone else, they probably couldn't withstand it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought to himself as Satan's Eye casually scanned a volcano below. Then his body froze, and a look of surprise appeared on his face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Is that the Dark Mandala?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, in Osborne's vision, within the magma pool of the volcano, a flower burning with purple-black flames floated amidst the magma. It appeared incredibly fragile, with extremely delicate branches and leaves, yet the terrifying heat and magma around it had no effect on it whatsoever.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On its petals, there were beautiful patterns, like twinkling stars.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "That's the Dark Mandala!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt extremely surprised. Previously, he had carefully searched through hundreds of volcanoes but found nothing, not a single Dark Mandala. Yet now, with just a casual glance, he had discovered a Dark Mandala.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just this one could be exchanged for a million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was very happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> could be exchanged for a million Sacred Crystals anywhere. The zone duel had just begun, and he had already earned a million Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn&rsquo;t hesitate. The ocular energy of Satan's Eye instantly enveloped the Dark Mandala deep within the volcano, aiming to absorb it into Satan's Eye's internal space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the next second, Osborne showed a surprised expression, sensing the resistance of the Dark Mandala.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He failed to absorb the Dark Mandala.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Satan's Eye's ocular energy not only failed to absorb the Dark Mandala, but the Dark Mandala, as if frightened, instantly dove into the magma, quickly fleeing deeper into the volcano.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "It's alive! It can resist my ocular energy power! I can't use ocular energy to absorb it; I have to personally enter the depths of the volcano and pull it out!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was a bit surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he didn't waste any time. The Dark Mandala was quickly diving deeper into the volcano, and if he didn't catch up soon, even Satan's Eye would lose its trace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Chase!" Osborne immediately rushed into the volcano, Sacred Power enveloping his body, without hesitation diving into the scorching magma, quickly pursuing the Dark Mandala.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, the Dark Mandala's escape speed wasn't fast.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, Osborne felt he could give up searching for the Dark Mandala because even if he found it, he might not be able to catch it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's body swiftly pursued within the magma.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, he reached a spot not far from the Dark Mandala. At this moment, he was closer to the Dark Mandala, and Osborne could clearly feel the intense power fluctuations emanating from it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I need to be careful. This Dark Mandala is highly toxic, and it might have other abilities! I can't fall here."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne finished thinking and took out the Warfare Shield.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Warfare Mist erupted, enveloping Osborne completely. Only then did Osborne quickly approach the Dark Mandala, reaching out to grab it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that moment, the Dark Mandala erupted completely, unleashing immense power that forcefully knocked Osborne's hand back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Such powerful strength!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No wonder this plant is worth a million Sacred Crystals. An ordinary Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King probably wouldn't be your match! Unfortunately, you've encountered me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stay with me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne reached out again, Sacred Power surging in his palm, instantly grabbing the Dark Mandala.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment he touched the Dark Mandala, it stopped moving, its power quickly retracting, turning into an ordinary-looking black flower.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? It's dead?" Osborne was extremely surprised but remained cautious. The Warfare Mist still protected him, allowing him to carefully observe the Dark Mandala. "What kind of creature is this?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dark Mandala is a specialty of Abyssal Planet. Before Abyssal Planet was discovered, no one on the entire Racial Convergence Planet had ever seen a Dark Mandala. Even its name was given temporarily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Osborne didn&rsquo;t know the characteristics of the Dark Mandala, nor did he know its purpose.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Primordial, do you recognize this Dark Mandala?" Osborne couldn't help but ask Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial woke up at the sound, quickly transforming into a small </span><span>treant</span><span>, appearing in front of Osborne and carefully examining the Dark Mandala in Osborne's hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Primordial showed a look of surprise, instantly snatching the Dark Mandala from Osborne's hand and examining it thoroughly from all angles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There's hope! Primordial might recognize it!" Osborne looked at Primordial with anticipation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After more than ten minutes, Primordial finally stopped and handed the Dark Mandala back to Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You didn't recognize it?" Osborne asked, puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial shook his head. "Of course, I recognize it! I'm one of the offshoots of the World Tree! In this cosmos, there's hardly anything I don't know!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Primordial looked proud.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes and asked, "Then tell me, what exactly is this!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
