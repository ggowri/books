  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the arena, fairness was always relative; absolute fairness was but a pipe dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> when Leroy whipped out the legendary Inferno Drake Lance, a Sacred Artifact, no one in the crowd batted an eye. After all, having a top-notch weapon was just part and parcel of a fighter's prowess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If one couldn't get his hands on one, tough luck!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't bothered by Leroy's edge, either. In fact, finding out she was wielding such a beast of a weapon only got his blood pumping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without missing a beat, he let loose a volley of ten Sacred Power arrows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrows zipped through the air like lightning bolts, their speed so blinding it seemed they might just rip a hole in the very fabric of existence as they streaked towards Leroy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Leroy stood her ground, radiating unwavering confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Osborne had already shown just how powerful his Sacred Power arrows were, Leroy didn't flinch. As the arrows closed in, she thrust the Inferno Drake Lance forward. A fearsome fire dragon burst forth from the spear, coiling and contorting until it took the shape of a real, menacing flame-breathing dragon. With a gaping maw, it gobbled up all ten of Osborne's arrows in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thunderous blast reverberated through the air as the arrows hit the fire dragon head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flames went flying in all directions, but the arrows simply disappeared into thin air!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like that, in a flash, Leroy had completely nullified Osborne's attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This jaw-dropping scene sent shockwaves through the crowd from Azure Haven Academy. They went wild, cheering and whooping with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you so! I always knew Leroy was a force to be reckoned with!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne's Sacred Power arrows were pretty cool, but they didn't stand a chance against Leroy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leroy's victory is in the bag!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's on an absolute tear!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the Azure Haven Academy folks were in full-on celebration mode, the supporters from Mystic Sirius Sect were left speechless. Their faces were blank with disbelief as they stared at Leroy and her Inferno Drake Lance, unable to look away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> freaking strong! It was mind-bogglingly powerful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the stuff of legends&mdash;the raw might of a Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way Osborne's ten Sacred Power arrows got wiped out in one fell swoop left the Mystic Sirius Sect supporters feeling utterly hopeless. How could they possibly keep fighting against such an unstoppable force? They might as well just call it quits!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But despite the gloomy mood among his sect's supporters, Osborne wasn't about to be discouraged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, the sheer power of the Inferno Drake Lance had caught him off guard, but his fighting spirit was like a blazing inferno.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stayed as cool as a cucumber. If one plan didn't work, he'd simply roll up his sleeves and try something else!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fired up with determination, he quickly readied his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow for another shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Osborne channeled all his energy into a single Sacred Power arrow, but this one was no ordinary arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It glowed with a brilliance ten times brighter than before, as Osborne poured his Divine Ascendance Technique into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That arrow became the very essence of his Spatial Oblivion Slash!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arrow shot off like a bullet, instantly shattering into a gazillion arrow shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They came raining down on Leroy like a never-ending onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cheering crowd from Azure Haven Academy suddenly went dead silent. Their excitement screeched to a halt, like a car slamming on the brakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? A new move?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Leroy raised an eyebrow, a flash of surprise crossing her face. But she didn't bat an eyelash. With a powerful swing of the Inferno Drake Lance, gushing flames shot out from its tip. They swirled around her like a tornado, quickly tearing apart the incoming arrow shadows. None of them could get anywhere near her. The blazing shield of fire from her Sacred Artifact stopped them all cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, the arrow shadows vanished into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd from Azure Haven Academy burst into cheers anew, but they missed the slight frown that crossed Leroy's face. Her hand on the Inferno Drake Lance started to quiver ever so slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She let out a scoff. "After firing off two such bone-crushing attacks in quick succession, your Sacred Power must be on its last legs. You're no Empyrean Sacredness warrior; you're just an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King! I bet your Sacred Power won't hold out much longer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a soft chuckle at Leroy's jibe. "Is that so</span><span>?</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What went unnoticed by everyone was the invisible roots sprouting from Osborne. They bored deep into the void around them, sucking up energy like a vacuum to refill his rapidly dwindling Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy wasn't completely off the mark; he wasn't a full-fledged Empyrean Sacredness warrior. He was just an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King. Even though he could tap into Sacred Power, his reserves weren't exactly bottomless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His attacks were taking a huge toll on his energy stores.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, Osborne would quickly run out of Sacred Power and his strength would take a nosedive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had an ace up his sleeve&mdash;the Chaotic Spiritual Root.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This incredible ability was like the might of the World Tree, enabling him to suck energy out of the void whenever he wanted. So, he never had to fret about running out of steam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go for round two!" Osborne announced, pulling back the string of his </span><span>Bloodwrought</span><span> Bow again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he placed a single arrow on it that looked like a strange dark ball.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the Dimensional Maw!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once his most devastating attack, it had taken Osborne ages and a whole lot of mental sweat to incorporate it into his archery skills. If it weren't for his extraordinary talent, he'd never have pulled it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with this technique imbued in the arrow, its power was off the charts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weird arrow zipped forward and appeared right in front of Leroy in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, it unleashed a terrifying gravitational pull that made Leroy stumble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her confidence wavered as a sense of impending doom washed over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Inferno Drake Lance! Break it!" she roared, her expression turning grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting her teeth, she poured her Sacred Power into the spear and thrust it forward with all her might, aiming to smash that menacing arrow to bits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clash of the two forces sent shockwaves rippling through the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The void around them shattered like delicate glass. The sheer might of the impact was catastrophic, causing everything in its path to collapse and crumble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, Leroy felt the Inferno Drake Lance being yanked towards the arrow, as if it had been caught in a powerful whirlpool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how hard she struggled, she couldn't move the spear. The overwhelming force was closing in on her, threatening to swallow her whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!" Leroy gasped, panic flashing across her face for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She summoned every ounce of her strength in a desperate bid to resist, but it was all in vain. Blood spurted from her mouth as she was violently hurled backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy's body crashed onto the arena floor, creating a huge crater on impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?! This can't be real!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that split-second, the top-brass from Azure Haven Academy shot up from their seats. The shock was clearly written all over their faces as they watched Leroy go down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd below, which had been a sea of passionate supporters just moments ago, fell into stunned silence, their faces contorted in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Leroy? Defeated?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't wrap their heads around it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How could she, armed with the Sacred Artifact Inferno Drake Lance, possibly lose? She </span><span style="font-style: italic;">was</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">supposed to steamroll Osborne easily, overwhelming him with brute force and clinching the championship without a shadow of a doubt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, they were seeing the unthinkable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the Inferno Drake Lance burst into fearsome flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A blazing dragon took shape, sweeping away the collapsing energy around it and charging straight towards the crater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, a blood-smeared arm reached out from the pit and firmly grasped the Inferno Drake Lance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with a ferocious roar, Leroy rocketed out of the crater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flames danced around her body, and her eyes blazed with unbridled fury. "You son of a bitch! How dare you make me look like such a loser! I'll never forgive you for this! You're </span><span>gonna</span><span> pay the price!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Inferno Drake Lance, annihilate!"</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
