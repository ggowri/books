  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Angelo was in a state of desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had poured all his strength into the fight, hoping to take down Deathborn King before the army arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was proving impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deathborn King matched him blow for blow, and no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't gain the upper hand. Edison and the others were utterly useless in this situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed Deathborn King had figured out Angelo's plan. Instead of engaging him directly, he danced around Angelo, dodging and entangling Angelo, clearly intent on stalling until his army could arrive to swarm Angelo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This tactic only heightened Angelo's anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deathborn King was like a slippery shadow. His true form was a soaring eagle, moving with blinding speed and refusing to engage in a straight fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hitting the King was proving to be a monumental challenge, and every time Angelo attempted to escape, the King would leap forward to keep him tethered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo's expression darkened. The swift approach of Deathborn King indicated that Deathborn Kingdom wasn't far away, and the army would soon be upon them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If things didn't change, he was done for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, something caught Angelo's eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned his head to the side, spotting a figure shrouded in dark mist racing toward their battlefield at an astonishing speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo exclaimed with surprise, "Wait, who is that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A peak Deity Overlord? Is he crazy for getting so close to the fight between me and Deathborn King?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could ponder further, the figure's speed surged, multiplying in an instant, and within the blink of an eye, it was right in front of Deathborn King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift slash of a sword, a dark blade of energy cut through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deathborn King seemed taken aback, clearly unprepared for an outsider to attack him, especially one at the peak of Deity Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden increase in speed caught him off guard, and before he could react, the black sword light struck him, tearing through his defenses and leaving a gruesome gash across his body. Blood sprayed as he was sent flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In one move, Deathborn King was injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The figure was none other than Osborne, harnessing dark power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything happened so fast that even Angelo was momentarily stunned by Osborne's explosive entrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, a look of delight spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Supreme Malevolence Sword! You're a genius from the Paramount Supreme Clan, aren't you?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the dark mist dissipated around Osborne, he revealed a face that bore a striking resemblance to Tobey, right down to the arrogant expression etched on his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo's heart raced with certainty. Osborne was indeed a prodigy from the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a dismissive smirk, Osborne quipped, "As a Deity King, you can't even handle a single Deathborn King without my help? Pathetic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo stiffened at the comment, and embarrassment crept into his tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh, what should I call you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne casually fabricated a name, replying coolly, "I'm Christopher Bowman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since I previously swiped three Miracle Elixirs from you, I'll lend you a hand this time. But let's hurry and take down this Deathborn King. Once his army arrives, I won't be responsible for your fate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo's heart sank at the urgency in Osborne's voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "So the one who swiped my Miracle Elixirs was indeed a genius from the Paramount Supreme Clan. Christopher, huh? I haven't heard that name before, but anyone brave enough to venture into Divine Peak Nine alone and manage to injure a Deathborn King with a single strike must be incredibly formidable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even within the Paramount Supreme Clan, he's likely one of the top-tier super talents. He might have even been personally trained by the esteemed Lord Malevolence himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, not many people know his name, but he's bound to amaze everyone soon enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I could just befriend him..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought racing through his mind, Angelo felt a surge of excitement. He quickly composed himself and declared, "I'll follow your lead, Mr. Bowman. Let's take down this Deathborn King together!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without missing a beat, Angelo launched his next attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wanting to impress Osborne, he decided to pull out all the stops, unleashing his most powerful technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mind Control Shackles!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a colossal chain formed from swirling tendrils of mind control power shot through the air like a colossal dragon, coiling and snapping like a whip as it surged toward Deathborn King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deathborn King desperately tried to evade, but the injury from Osborne's strike had already slowed him down. He managed to dodge a few times, but ultimately, he couldn't escape the grasp of Angelo's mind control chains, which ensnared him with brutal force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo's face paled as he struggled to maintain the hold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted to Osborne, "Mr. Bowman. Hurry up! My Mind Control Shackles won't hold him for long. Finish him off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up at the opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a chance! Eclipse of Eternity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overwhelming darkness enveloped the trapped Deathborn King, cutting him off from the outside world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the dark power radiating from Osborne erupted violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Abyssal Spear!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive black spear materialized in the air, crackling with energy, ready to strike.</span></p><div class="pagination">
