  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone turned their attention to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne spoke up, "Diana! She's at the early stage of Deity Overlord and is currently absorbing the power of the Miracle Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once she fully harnesses its properties, she should advance to the mid-stage of Deity Overlord, significantly increasing her potential! With enough Celestial Crystals, she'll soon reach the peak of Deity Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Most importantly, she has incredible talent and strength."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne finished, everyone couldn't help but picture Diana in their minds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had all seen her on Divine Peak Nine and nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think it's a great idea!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Me too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With her on our side, we'll resemble the Seven Great Deity Kings of the Human Community even more! They have two men and five women, just like us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! We'll definitely remind the various races under Lord Malevolence of the power and terror of the Seven Great Deity Kings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like that, their plan was set in motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah wanted to join in, but she wasn't part of the Human Community, which made her presence unsuitable. It would tarnish the reputation of the "Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, her future seemed bleak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah didn't know how much longer she could survive, and she still feared that the Bowman family would relentlessly pursue her. The thought of escape felt impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she had been born and raised in Celestara, and she understood the formidable power of the Paramount Supreme Clan all too well. Unlike Osborne, Bryce, and the others, she couldn't afford to be indifferent to the clan's might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Hannah could only watch as they discussed their plans for fame in Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden thought sparked in Hannah's mind as she looked at Osborne. "They're definitely going to succeed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was he who had given her this newfound confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne turned to Hannah. "Hannah, can you continue to help us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah was taken aback but quickly replied, "Of course! What can I do to help? I'll do everything I can! I just worry that my strength isn't enough to make a significant difference."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt uncertain about her abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled gently, "What you're going to do is incredibly important for us! You're the only one among us who truly understands Celestara! We can't make a name for ourselves here without you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah felt her cheeks flush at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I'm... I'm not that important!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne insisted, "You are vital! To make a name for ourselves in Celestara, the first step is to showcase our strength and talent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And to do that, we need to challenge the most talented and famous young people from various races!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But we know nothing about them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've hidden your identity and challenged their geniuses, so you must be familiar with the top talents in Celestara, right? I need you to help us compile a list of those super geniuses!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah was momentarily stunned by his request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, she regained her composure and nodded. "No problem! I can help with that! In fact, I've already prepared a list. I was just waiting until I reached a higher level before challenging them one by one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Osborne's eyes lit up with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah continued, "If you want to make a name for yourselves, you don't need to challenge the talents of ordinary races. Sure, they're strong, but their fame is limited, and defeating them won't attract much attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Instead, focus on taking down the top ten Upper Races and the young powerhouses from the Paramount Supreme Clan! Each person on this list is a super genius renowned in their regions, nearly unbeatable among their peers at the same level. If you can defeat them, your reputation will skyrocket!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least in one region, that's a guarantee! As you conquer more regional talents, your fame will naturally grow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Hannah pulled out a neatly prepared list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are 250 names on this list! I selected ten of the most famous and powerful young talents from each of the top ten Upper Races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Additionally, there are 50 young geniuses from the Paramount Supreme Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, they're all below the Deity King level."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up with excitement as he glanced at the list. He quickly realized how thorough Hannah had been. Each entry included not just the name but also the race, faction, location, strength level, Divine Body, power attributes, elemental essence level, and even their preferred techniques and past achievements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, it was an incredibly comprehensive list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone who made it onto this list was undoubtedly a super genius, a standout among their peers, and had already made a name for themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others leaned in with curiosity, eager to see the names.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, these guys are seriously strong!" one of them exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at those battle records! Their Divine Bodies and power levels are right up there with us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can we really take them on?" another voice chimed in, uncertainty creeping in.</span></p><div class="pagination">
