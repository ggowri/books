  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad's eyes blazed with fury as he barreled towards Osborne's position, his blood boiling with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he got closer, he spotted a cluster of white dots closing in on Osborne as well. A sneering smirk appeared on his face, oozing with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">You think a high score means jack if you can't back it up? You're like a toddler clutching a fortune, surrounded by a pack of hungry wolves. That so-called 'treasure' of yours will only get you devoured in the end!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Ha! This is going to be a real show!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad guffawed, picking up the pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, first come, first served when it came to that juicy prize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Benson stared at the latest scoreboard and scowled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell? I dropped another spot?" he muttered, shocked to find himself slipping from fourth to fifth place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sarcastic smile appeared on his face. "Well, this state duel is full of surprises.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides Agatha, Horace, and Broderick, it seems I've got some new worthy opponents. Let's see how you measure up against me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, Benson made his way towards Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As an elite disciple of a First-rate Power, he'd recently merged a third type of energy, confident he could steamroll his competition and clinch the state duel championship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when he reached Frost Peak City, Benson quickly realized there were three others who'd also combined three powers, each one a force to be reckoned with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson'd busted his butt to rack up points, and landing in fourth place had left him seething. His plan was to take on these three and steal their points to claim the championship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he was about to make his move, Osborne had suddenly shot up to third place, throwing a wrench in his plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson was fuming. He couldn't just sit back and watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He made up his mind to take on Osborne, Clara, and Leroy and grab their points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he pulled it off, Broderick would be well within his sights, and who knew, maybe even Horace and Agatha wouldn't be out of reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Broderick was equally ticked off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being pushed out of third place by someone who'd been way down the ranks really rubbed him the wrong way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A low growl rumbled from his throat, and his eyes flashed with pure, unadulterated malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Think you can steal my third-place spot? You're just asking for a good thrashing! I'm coming for you, and I'll snatch your points and send you straight back to the gutter where you belong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Broderick surrounded himself with a menacing aura of flames and took off like a shot towards Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Horace was scowling too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Osborne's points hadn't overtaken his, he could feel the heat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of thought, he got to his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I can take out all three of those top-ten guys, I'll score two million points! Then I can finally overtake Agatha!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get cracking!" Horace said with determination and quickly made his way towards Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But amidst all this chaos, there was one person who remained as cool as a cucumber&mdash;Agatha.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd seen this coming from a mile away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Agatha saw Osborne's points and ranking skyrocket, she took a deep breath, and her competitive spirit flared up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She murmured excitedly, "You're finally back in the game!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never thought you'd catch up to me so fast! But if your points still fall short by the end, winning this championship won't feel as sweet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, looks like we're in this race together now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see who comes out on top in our final showdown!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Agatha got to her feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that you're here, there's no point waiting until the end to deal with the others. It's time to take them out first..." Agatha said, eyeing her badge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she watched a bunch of white dots quickly closing in on Osborne's position, a cold smile spread across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To the inexperienced, those eager contestants looked like ravenous wolves closing in on their prey, ready to rip Osborne to shreds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to Agatha, they were like moths mindlessly flying into a fire, marching straight to their demise!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly focused on three especially bright dots and recognized them right away&mdash;Horace, Broderick, and Benson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Broderick and Benson want to cause trouble for Osborne too? How pathetic! But you won't get the chance. I'll be the one to knock you out first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Agatha vanished in a blur and shot forward like a bullet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Frost Peak City, the crowd of onlookers caught the change on the projection screens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air crackled with excitement as they realized that nearly all the heavy-hitters were zeroing in on Osborne, Clara, and Leroy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Check it out! They're all on the move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Every single one of the top thirty is heading straight for Osborne and his gang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! This is the end for them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, they've got high scores right now, but with so many gunning for them, there's no way they can hold their ground. They'll get knocked down over and over, losing points until they're out of the top ten!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! There's no way they can wiggle out of this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The top thirty are like a pack of starved wolves going in for the kill. I almost feel bad for Osborne and his mates!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why feel sorry? If you're not strong enough, those high scores won't save your bacon. Making it into the top ten is all about skill, not luck!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look! Broderick, Benson, and Horace are on the move too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad they're so far away. By the time they reach Osborne, those three might have already had their points snatched away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, is Agatha moving as well?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold up! She doesn't seem to be going after Osborne. Her target looks like Benson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Agatha's going for Benson! Is she trying to kick off the final showdown early and take on Benson, Broderick, and Horace before it's all said and done?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is getting juicy! We're in for a real treat now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd in Frost Peak City was abuzz with excitement, eagerly awaiting the clash between Osborne and the group ganging up on him and Agatha's daring move towards Benson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The upcoming battle in the Arctic Maw Chasm was shaping up to be an absolute fireworks show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that tense atmosphere, Agatha swiftly got in front of Benson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sensed her approach and instinctively tried to dodge around Agatha, but no matter how he darted, she stuck to him like glue, the fierce energy she radiated sending a chill down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without further ado, Benson made up his mind to face her head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Benson squared off against Agatha, the fire of battle blazed in his eyes. "So, Agatha, you're up for a fight with me right now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha looked him in the eye with a cool smile. "You bet! Let's get this party started! I was gonna save you for last, but truth be told, I don't see any point in waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I'm gonna take you down."</span></p><div class="pagination">
