  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body trembled with exhilaration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have news about my parents?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are they?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are they still alive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice quivered, a mix of hope and anxious anticipation. Osborne had been an orphan since he could remember. Images of his parents were mere shadows in his memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the blood bond was undeniable, a connection that could never be severed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Part of the reason Osborne had pushed himself to grow stronger was the desire to find them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with news finally in reach, his excitement soared, tempered only by the dread of hearing they were no longer alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed his gaze on Sebastian, waiting with bated breath for an answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian's eyes smoldered with rage as he replied, "Reginald took your parents and brought them back to the Pantheon League. They endured unimaginable torment there. The League intended to use your parents to coerce me into selling Rosmandi's rare metal mines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their true goal was the Crystal of Life, as it would allow their deities to recover their powers at an astonishing rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But your parents refused to comply! Eventually, they found a moment to escape, vanishing into a dark vortex and never returning..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the words sank in, cold fury ignited within Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So it was the Pantheon League all along!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They abducted my parents just to exploit the rare metal mines for the Crystals of Life?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was all for their deity ancestors?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Reginald still alive? I need to know if he lied to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian nodded grimly. "He's still breathing... for now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a shared understanding, they made their way to the dungeon of the Augustine Bastion. There, in the deepest recesses, they found a wretched figure huddled in the corner&mdash;Reginald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spotted Sebastian and Osborne approach, Reginald's voice emerged weakly. "Sebastian! I've already told you everything! You can't just leave me in here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm with the Pantheon League! All the deities are awake now! Their power is beyond your imagination!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have to let me go, or the Pantheon League will unleash hell on you and the Augustine family! With just a breath, they could wipe you all out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't respond but looked over at Osborne. "What's your plan for interrogating him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked coldly. "Interrogation? Not needed! Just kill him. As long as I preserve his memories, I can unearth everything I want to know!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he raised a hand, channeling divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Reginald's form shattered into a crimson mist, dead before he hit the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne activated his Satan's Eye, instantly capturing Reginald's memories and constructing a memory palace within his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He delved deep into the fragments of Reginald's past, seeking the truth about his parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian watched in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though his own Satan's Eye had reached Level Seven, allowing him to manipulate memories, he couldn't do what Osborne just had&mdash;capture another's memories with such ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't vocalize his thoughts. Instead, he remained quiet, waiting patiently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Osborne was sifting through Reginald's memories and stumbled upon the long-sought images of his parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood frozen, his heart racing as he witnessed something he had never seen before&mdash;his parents, albeit through Reginald's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His father was strikingly handsome, exuding an air of sophistication, while his mother radiated beauty and warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together, they strolled down a street in Skyefall, pushing a baby carriage, an idyllic scene that felt almost surreal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, everything changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched as Reginald, a top-tier Class S warrior over twenty years ago, sprang into action. His parents, one a Class AAA and the other a Class AA, stood no chance against him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a matter of moments, they were overpowered, taken without a sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before leaving, Reginald unleashed a devastating blast of power, striking the baby carriage with a force that sent it soaring through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's breath caught in his throat as he saw the carriage explode, splintering into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight was horrific; the child inside&mdash;the child that was him&mdash;was obliterated by that overwhelming force, reduced to nothing but a gruesome mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stunned, Osborne's mind raced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell just happened?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The child in that carriage was undeniably me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can see the small birthmark on the child's neck, identical to my own&mdash;there is no mistaking it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But according to Reginald's memories, I've been 'killed' over twenty years ago, my body blown apart. How can I possibly be alive now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What the hell is happening?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is this a glitch in Reginald's memory, or have I somehow&mdash;against all odds&mdash;come back to life?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it really possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he continued to sift through Reginald's memories, Osborne's thoughts spiraled into chaos, each revelation only deepening the mystery of his existence.</span></p><div class="pagination">
