  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this all the power you've got? You dare to challenge me?" Osborne scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, purple lightning crackled around him. To avoid revealing his true identity too soon, he chose to use his rarely seen Thunder Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This also served as a setup for later when he would acquire the Hammer of Thor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer force of his Level Eight peak lightning elemental essence unleashed a terrifying wave of energy, shattering Kurt's divine power defenses in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, a brilliant light erupted around Kurt, blocking Osborne's lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? A defensive suit?" Osborne's eyes lit up in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected Kurt to be wearing an outfit with such formidable protective capabilities. While it wasn't as strong as Caesar's Supreme Sovereign's Armor, it was still impressive&mdash;definitely comparable to an Ultimate defensive divine artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it wasn't as robust as Supreme Sovereign's Armor, breaking through it wouldn't be easy for Osborne unless he was willing to reveal more of his own cards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly calculated his next move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Kurt had regained his composure. "You little punk! I didn't realize you were also a mid-stage Deity King! No wonder you're so cocky! Your lightning elemental essence is impressive, but it won't be enough to take me down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got Ultimate Luminous Armor, which is stronger than your average Ultimate defensive divine artifact! It's only second to Sanctum Level Luminous Armor! With my strength powering it, I can withstand several attacks from even a peak Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You might be a mid-stage Deity King like me, but you won't be able to touch me! I'm practically invincible. You're done for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt's eyes were icy with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted, "So it's Ultimate Luminous Armor! Nice! Well, it'll soon belong to me! Oh, and I forgot to mention&mdash;I'm also a psychic power or soul power wielder! I hope your soul power is strong enough to withstand a few soul attacks!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a glint of determination flashed in Osborne's eyes as he unleashed a soul strike on Kurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The soul strike was a basic and straightforward method of soul power attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to Zoe's "Soul Melody", Osborne's soul strike was much weaker, but his vast reserves of soul power made even this simplest technique more than sufficient to deal with a mid-stage Deity King like Kurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both the Supreme Sovereign's Armor and Luminous Armor could only defend against energy and physical attacks. They were utterly ineffective against soul-based assaults.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's soul power pierced through the defenses of the Luminous Armor like a needle, driving straight into Kurt's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, Kurt let out a blood-curdling scream, his eyes bulging as he felt his Soul Current Ocean violently convulsing, teetering on the brink of collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne wasn't done with him yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep going! Soul strike!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne unleashed three consecutive soul strikes, each one shattering Kurt's Soul Current Ocean, plunging him into a state of unconsciousness before finally stopping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, frustration creeping in, "I need to figure out a way to acquire a soul power attack technique! My soul power is at least a hundred times greater than Kurt's! With such overwhelming soul power, it took me multiple attacks to knock him out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Zoe were here, she could probably obliterate Kurt's Soul Current Ocean in one strike!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but shake his head at the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finding a soul power technique was incredibly rare, and even if he wanted to search for one, he had no idea where to start.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For now, Osborne pushed the thought aside and glanced around, a cold smile on his face as he hoisted the unconscious Kurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group of young men who had followed Kurt were frozen in shock and fear, their bodies trembling as they witnessed their leader being effortlessly carried by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them, mustering up some courage, shouted at Osborne, "Let... let Mr. Baxter go! He's the heir of the Baxter family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His father is Trevor Baxter, a Supernal Deity King! The Baxter family is a Dukedom Level Power, one of the ten great families of the Human Community, the true rulers of Apocalypse City! How dare you harm Mr. Baxter?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Release him at once, or you'll pay for it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted dismissively, "A bunch of useless fools trying to scare me with the Baxter family? I'm so terrified! But you know what? I couldn't care less about the Baxter family! All I know is that Kurt tried to take me down, and now he's in my grasp!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You pathetic losers aren't worth my time. Just get out of here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go back and tell Trevor that his son is with me! If he wants to get his boy back, he better bring ten sets of Luminous Armor and three Ultimate divine artifacts related to lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be waiting at Astral Wolf Peak this time tomorrow!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I don't see those items, the Baxter family can start preparing for Kurt's funeral! Oh, and make sure to tell them that only you pathetic weaklings are allowed to deliver the goods to Astral Wolf Peak! If any other strong members of the Baxter family try to approach... well, they can join Kurt in the afterlife!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne took off like a bolt of lightning, clutching Kurt tightly as he vanished from sight.</span></p><div class="pagination">
