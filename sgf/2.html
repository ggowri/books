  <div class="container"><p style="text-align:left;">As Osborne stared at them, he once again questioned if he was dreaming. Perhaps he was still on the floor, either dead or beaten unconscious. A sense of shock overwhelmed him. </p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;The Godfather wants to see me?&quot; he asked, confused. &quot;Which one?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mr. Augustine, with respect, there&#x27;s only one Godfather in Rosmandi,&quot; the leader replied.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne&#x27;s eyes widened.</p><p style="text-align:left;"><em>The Godfather? The ruler of Rosmandi&#x27;s underworld? Why would someone so powerful want to see me? And why are they kneeling?</em></p><p style="text-align:left;">His mind raced with questions, but before he could inquire further, the man simply opened the car door.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Mr. Augustine, please, get in. All will be explained in time. The Godfather is waiting for you.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne hesitated for a moment, but figuring he had nothing to lose and nowhere else to go, got in the car.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The moment he took his seat, a screen turned on, showing the shadowy silhouette of a burly man, sitting in a large chair with a black cat in his lap.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne squinted through bruised and battered eyes, trying to get a better look at the imposing man before him. From what Osborne could discern, the man had slicked-back hair, a black suit, and a bowtie. He exuded wealth and prestige.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne squinted harder, but he still couldn&#x27;t make out the man&#x27;s face. All he could see were two piercing eyes cutting through the shadows.</p><p style="text-align:left;"><em>Is he the Godfather? </em></p><p style="text-align:left;">Even through the screen, his power was obvious.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Suddenly, the man shooed the black cat from his lap. He stood up, leaning on a cane as he approached the camera. </p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne recoiled as the man came into focus.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You... how?&quot; As hard as he tried, he couldn&#x27;t break eye contact with the shadowy figure. His gaze… It couldn&#x27;t be.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The man smiled, pointing to his left eye as he leaned closer to the camera. &quot;You&#x27;re wondering why my left eye has double pupils like yours, aren&#x27;t you? Well, to most I&#x27;m the Godfather. But you can call me Grandfather. &quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;What?&quot; Osborne&#x27;s eyes widened, revealing double pupils in his reflection.  </p><p style="text-align:left;">He was stunned into silence.</p><p style="text-align:left;">An orphan all his life, he never knew his family.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Now, out of nowhere, the Godfather showed up and claimed to be his grandfather?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Was it a prank arranged by Ophelia? Was it brain damage from the beating he took?</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Kid, I know it&#x27;s hard to believe, but it&#x27;s true. There&#x27;s a DNA test on your right, middle seat. Take a look,&quot; the Godfather said.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne picked up the sealed manilla envelope and tore it open, a sense of bewilderment washing over him as he leafed through the report. </p><p style="text-align:left;">There, in bold print, were the results confirming their relationship.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Could this man really be his grandfather? With the Godfather&#x27;s status, faking it seemed unnecessary. Still, despite the report, Osborne had his doubts. After the morning he&#x27;d had, he wasn&#x27;t about to believe a damn thing without definitive proof.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;We share The Eye of Satan, a signature trait of the Augustine family&#x27;s bloodline. It activates the first time you sleep with a woman after coming of age.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Hearing this, Osborne was <em>almost</em> convinced. It seemed too specific to be fake. His eye mutation was his secret, unknown even to his ex-wife Ophelia—and the timing of the mutation&#x27;s first occurrence aligned perfectly with what the Godfather described.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;The Eye of Satan, huh?&quot; Osborne whispered, seeking further confirmation. &quot;Anything special about it? Can it do anything?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;It&#x27;s powerful beyond imagination. From the looks of it, yours is still level one, which means it enhances daytime vision, grants night vision, and slows your perception of time,&quot; the Godfather explained.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne stifled a gasp. His vision <em>had</em> become incredibly sharp, even at night, and he could see fast-moving objects in slow motion.</p><p style="text-align:left;"><em>Everything</em> matched. </p><p style="text-align:left;">Tears welled in his eyes.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Have you always known about me? Why wait until now? And why did my parents abandon me?&quot; </p><p style="text-align:left;">He remembered living under bridges with his sister, fighting for scraps, thinking he was nothing more than a street kid.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Now, he had a legacy. He had a family. His grandfather was the Godfather—a billionaire several times over. </p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Sorry, kid. You may be my grandson, but you&#x27;re not getting answers to those questions just yet. Not unless you become my official heir,&quot; the Godfather said coolly.  </p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Heir?&quot; </p><p style="text-align:left;">The Godfather nodded. &quot;What can I say? I&#x27;m not getting any younger. I need to preserve my legacy. As my grandson, you have the right to inherit everything—assuming you want it. So, what&#x27;s it going to be? Do you want to become the new Godfather?&quot;</p><div class="pagination">
