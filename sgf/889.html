  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the Realm of powers, when two entities with the same attributes collided in the same space, they inevitably repelled each other, resulting in a violent clash where only one could prevail.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's Spatial Domain was stronger than Felicity's.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, as their Realms collided, Felicity's Spatial Domain began to shatter, cracking with a sound like splintering glass before exploding outward in a violent burst.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Felicity's Realm crumbled, and she felt a sharp backlash to her mind, causing her to spit out a mouthful of blood.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Felicity's face turned pale as she stared at Osborne, disbelief etched across her features.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How is this possible?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just over two weeks ago, you disguised yourself as Axell and participated in Cuthbert's Honor Quest Ceremony. At that time, your Spatial Domain was barely grasped; it was still in the Primary Realm! How could you have advanced so dramatically in just a matter of weeks?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not only have you reached Level Two Realm, but you're also teetering on the brink of Level Three!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It can't be!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Felicity was genuinely stunned. Her confidence in defeating Osborne stemmed not only from her own prowess but also from her belief that Osborne's Spatial Domain was inferior to hers.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, faced with the reality of his rapid advancement, she realized her miscalculation.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smirked, an air of calm confidence surrounding him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During the last half month of seclusion, he had relentlessly consumed star power, honing his space elemental essence, lightning elemental essence, and mental essence, which had propelled his Spatial Domain to new heights.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He replied coolly, his gaze steady on Felicity, "Nothing is impossible. Your disbelief is a testament to your limited perspective. Did you really think you could defeat me and stop my winning streak? How absurd!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He took deliberate steps toward her, his presence imposing. "Over forty years ago, your father managed to defeat Godfather, but only because Godfather was exhausted. Still, he did defeat Godfather. Today, I'll make sure to avenge Godfather!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Osborne moved in a flash, appearing right in front of Felicity.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her eyes widened in horror as she instinctively tried to flee.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But within Osborne's Spatial Domain, escape was an illusion. He swiftly blocked her path again.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, with a powerful kick, he struck.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The force of his attack shattered Felicity's defenses, exploding within her body.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She coughed up blood, but her resilience shone through; the pain only fueled her determination.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew that to escape, she had to break Osborne's Spatial Domain.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But alas, Felicity's attempts were futile.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite her strength, Osborne's Spatial Domain, now so close to Level Three, was not something she could easily shatter.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, Osborne was stronger.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once more, Osborne sent Felicity flying with a brutal kick, the impact wreaking havoc on her internal organs, causing her to vomit blood uncontrollably.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Panic and despair flooded her eyes.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Felicity's confidence evaporated.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Felicity had thought this would be her destined battle against Osborne, that she could emulate her father and put an end to his streak, leaving it at 95 victories.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she had gravely misjudged Osborne's power.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Within the confines of his Spatial Domain, he was a god. Unable to breach his defenses, she could do nothing but endure his relentless onslaught and humiliation. If it weren't for the Honor Quest Ceremony's rules preventing him from killing her, she would have surely met her end by now!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her dire state, Felicity found herself tossed around like a ragdoll. Osborne treated her as if she were nothing more than a ball in a game, relentlessly kicking her around within his Spatial Domain.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Each strike sent her spiraling, blood spilling from her lips, yet she was trapped, unable to escape the arena.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stop it!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A sharp voice cut through the chaos, and a figure cloaked in a similar garment rose to his feet.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, if you still have any semblance of a man left in you, let her go! I'm the third disciple of the King of the Aberrants! If you have the guts, come at me instead!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that declaration, he threw back his hood, revealing a face etched with cold fury, his eyes locked onto Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A wave of gasps rippled through the crowd.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's Bradley!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Bradley, the third disciple of the King of the Aberrants? He's ranked 46th on the rankings! Among the younger generation, only Marlon and Cuthbert rank higher than him!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The spectators were in awe.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne paused, his grip tightening around Felicity's throat as he turned to glare at Bradley.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're the third disciple of the King of the Aberrants? Bradley, huh?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't get too hasty. You'll have your turn soon enough! But first, I need to deal with her."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a brutal motion, Osborne slammed Felicity's battered body down onto the arena floor, the impact echoing like thunder.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bradley's gaze turned icy, a chilling intent radiating from him as he watched Felicity's suffering unfold.</p><div class="pagination">
