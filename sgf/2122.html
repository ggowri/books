They wouldn't have lost so many team members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But regret came too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Osborne," Joanna and Chuck said in unison, bowing slightly in gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joanna continued, her tone earnest, "Osborne, you've saved our lives. We don't know how to repay you, but from now on, you are the greatest friend of the Sylvan Elf Clan's Royal Family.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever difficulties you face in the future, come to us, and we will do everything in our power to help!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's the promise of the Sylvan Elf Clan's Royal Family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chuck added, nodding firmly, "What my sister has promised, I promise as well.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We may not have anything to repay you with, but we offer you our friendship and our word."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up at their words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had rushed to save Joanna and the others simply because Joanna had once helped him, never expecting anything in return. Now, to gain the friendship of the Sylvan Elf Clan's Royal Family, along with the promises of Joanna and Chuck, was an unexpected but welcome reward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the heart of Elf City, the Sylvan Elf Clan's Royal Family held much greater power than that of the Nature Elf Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the various factions in Elf City, the Sylvan Elf Clan ranked just behind the Light Elf Clan and Shadow Elf Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, they were the third strongest among the nine major Elven Clans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Princess Joanna, Prince Chuck, no need to be so formal! When I first arrived in Elf City, you, Princess Joanna, were incredibly helpful to me! </span><span>And</span><span>, I would never turn away from the friendship of the Sylvan Elf Clan's Royal Family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Joanna's face lit up with joy, a bright smile breaking across her features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Letitia approached with an excited glint in her eyes, accompanied by the peculiar-looking Jaden and Renata.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Letitia exclaimed, her gaze sparkling, "Osborne!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't believe how amazing you are!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you so much! You saved our lives!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, the thirty surviving members of the exploration teams gathered around Osborne to show their gratitude. Their conversations turned to the formidable Mud Golems they had encountered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chuck spoke up, "Osborne, those creatures are called Mud Golems. They're symbiotic beings formed from the deep mud of the Corrosive Marsh and a special crystal. They have a humanoid outline and possess incredible attack and defense capabilities.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their energy source comes from a pale blue crystal at their chests! This crystal, known as Azure Ore, contains energy that is even purer and more potent than Sacred Crystals. While it doesn't elevate one's cultivation level, it can be infused into divine artifacts to enhance their power!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you have enough Azure Ore and use special methods to fuse it with a divine artifact, you could even cause the divine artifact to transform into a Sacred Artifact infused with Sacred Power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Infusing it into divine artifacts can boost their power? And even allow them to evolve into Sacred Artifacts with their own Sacred Power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His breathing quickened at the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Is that Azure Ore?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Alfreda gasped as she looked at Osborne, her expression filled with envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, she had heard of Azure Ore but had never laid eyes on it before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne reached into his Dimensional Space and pulled out a shimmering piece of Azure Ore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel the immense energy radiating from it, the energy that could enhance divine artifacts but couldn't be absorbed for personal gain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then produced the Bloodwrought Bow from his belongings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can I infuse this Azure Ore into a divine artifact?" he asked earnestly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joanna and Chuck exchanged glances before Chuck replied, "Only a handful of the most elite factions know the method to enhance divine artifacts using Azure Ore, but we have such records within the Sylvan Elf Clan's Royal Family.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Though it's a closely guarded secret, you saved our lives. As one of Sylvan Elf Clan's finest friends, I'll share this knowledge with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without further ado, Osborne felt a psychic wave connect with him, and he did not resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, a stream of information flooded his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Grimoire of Sacred Artifact Forging?" he murmured, quickly skimming the details.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face paled in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a complete guide to forging Sacred Artifacts by hand! The method for infusing Azure Ore into divine artifacts was just a piece of this vast knowledge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Grimoire of Sacred Artifact Forging in his possession, as long as he fully grasped it and had enough rare materials, Osborne could craft an entire set of Apex Sacred Artifacts tailored just for him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The value of this Grimoire was beyond measure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Puzzled, Osborne looked up at Chuck.</span></p><div class="pagination">
