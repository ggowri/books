  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared in shock, unable to believe what he'd just heard. Walter, Lachlan's grandfather, wanted him to marry into the Mystic Feather Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The very idea of being tethered to them left him uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He certainly didn't want to become a part of that family, no matter how influential the Mystic Feather Clan was or how much power they held over Wild Flame City from their floating mountain strongholds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furrowing his brow, he felt the weight of the situation bear down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda shot him a glance, wearing a mocking smirk. "What's the matter? You're not pleased? This is the Mystic Feather Clan we're talking about! Trust me, you don't get a say in this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We may be the strongest force of the Human Community in Wild Flame City, but our position isn't exactly enviable. The other races look down on us. If we want to thrive and avoid their oppression, we have to play the game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marrying into one of the upper-race families is part of Grandpa's strategy! As a core member of the Swift family with solid strength and talent, you're one of the most likely candidates to attract attention from an upper race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So you need to be ready to sacrifice. If you marry that noble lady from the Mystic Feather Clan, not only will you reap huge rewards, but the entire Swift family will benefit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember, the Mystic Feather Clan is one of the few that doesn't actively discriminate against the Human Community! They don't look down on us, which gives you a genuine shot at winning that lady's heart. Of course, she has some health issues; otherwise, you probably wouldn't even be in the running.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, even with her physical shortcomings, you have a plethora of rivals. But don't worry, Grandpa will handle everything for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda rattled on, oblivious to the growing discomfort evident on Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each of her words, Osborne felt his desire to abandon Lachlan's identity intensify.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he took a moment to compose himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "I'll wait and see how things play out. If it comes down to it, I can always let go of the Lachlan identity. Besides, there's no guarantee that the Mystic Feather Clan's noble lady would even look my way. I might not have to marry into the Mystic Feather Clan after all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne replied calmly, "I'll go along with whatever Grandpa decides."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Images of the Mystic Feather Clan flashed through his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were certainly one of the upper races in Wild Flame City, residing in the stunning floating mountains to the east. Their members were known for their beauty and gentle nature, aligning with human standards of attractiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Remarkably, the Mystic Feather Clan was the only upper race among the ten brought in by Lord Malevolence that didn't hold prejudice against the native Human Community. In fact, they were the only race that seemed to genuinely care for the well-being of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were stories about how the Mystic Feather Clan had once proposed equal standing for the Human Community alongside the other races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had even advocated for the release of human miners, pushing for better treatment, greater freedom, and a safer working environment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, their proposals were met with rejection from the other races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nonetheless, it was undeniable that the Mystic Feather Clan had consistently sought to uplift the Human Community, demonstrating a willingness to intermarry with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was precisely why the Swift family believed entering into an alliance with the Mystic Feather Clan could elevate their own status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mystic Feather Clan&hellip;" Osborne pondered, newfound curiosity piquing within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, the Mystic Feather Clan seemed far more appealing than the Swift family, whose members looked down upon human miners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, the Mystic Feather Clan was actively striving to support those very same miners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder who the noble lady from the Mystic Feather Clan is that I'm supposed to marry as 'Lachlan,'" Osborne murmured to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here we are!" Belinda suddenly announced as she brought the vehicle to a halt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peering out, Osborne took in the bustling heart of Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before him lay a breathtaking garden, as if plucked from the pages of a fairytale, dotted with luxurious buildings that seemed to shimmer in the light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It struck him instantly&mdash;this was the Swift Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Belinda parked the car, they stepped out and ambled toward the heart of the Swift Manor. As they walked, numerous servants bowed respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Greetings, Ms. Belinda Swift!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Greetings, Mr. Lachlan Swift!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne observed the bowing servants, a frown creased his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These were all members of the Human Community, and their position within the Swift family was that of enslaved individuals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Belinda appeared oblivious to their servile greetings, walking with her head held high and a proud stride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, Osborne lifted his hand to signal the servants to stand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They passed hundreds of such Human Community slaves, and with each passing moment, Osborne's discomfort deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, there was little he could do to change the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, they arrived at the central area of the Swift Manor, standing before an enormous building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the residence of Walter, the current head of the Swift family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne and Belinda were set to pay their respects to their grandfather, Walter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The anticipation of meeting him weighed heavily on Osborne, creating a palpable tension in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Walter is a Deity Overlord warrior! This is my first time meeting a real Deity Overlord! I just hope my disguise holds up under scrutiny!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
