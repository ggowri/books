  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie paused, clearly taken aback by Osborne's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he chuckled, saying, "No wonder the Grand Elder of the Prophet Alliance advised me to treat you with respect, just like I would treat him. I was skeptical at first&mdash;after all, you are just a rising talent, not unlike many others during the Age of Gods. But now I see why the Grand Elder made that decision."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Eddie bowed politely to Osborne once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you already know the source of this calamity, we can rest easy and save our breath. However, I'm still in the dark about its origin&mdash;would you mind enlightening me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was a bit surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "The Grand Elder of the Prophet Alliance told Eddie to be courteous to me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could he have predicted something?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it seems the Prophet Alliance aims to be friends rather than foes, so there's no need to be overly cautious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded and said, "Of course, let's discuss this further in a more comfortable setting at the Augustine Bastion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his hand, Osborne opened a dimensional portal leading directly to Augustine Bastion's guest chamber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Pike, please."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie smiled, seemingly unfazed, and stepped through the portal with his entourage, showing no fear of any potential harm from Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, they found themselves in the guest chamber of the Augustine Bastion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie couldn't hide his astonishment. "Such dense energy! It must be a hundred times more potent here than outside. This place is truly a paradise for cultivation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Prophet Alliance were equally impressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them was an acquaintance of Osborne's&mdash;Jackie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had presided over Cuthbert's Honor Quest Ceremony and Osborne's own, lending a helping hand in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackie, who had since ascended to deity status, was also part of Eddie's delegation, likely as a gesture of goodwill to reassure Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it turned out to be unnecessary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing quietly at the back, Jackie watched as Osborne and Eddie exchanged pleasantries. He marveled at how even Eddie showed such respect to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but reflect, "How much has changed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than a year, Osborne has reached this level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Cuthbert's Honor Quest Ceremony, Osborne was just a Class A warrior, a mere junior in my eyes. If not for my intervention, he might have been taken down by a Class S warrior from the Williamson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Osborne's power is unfathomable to me, reaching heights I can hardly imagine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Jackie noticed Osborne looking his way and quickly bowed to show respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, caught a bit off guard, sidestepped and said, "Mr. Flores, you're being far too generous. You're my senior and have helped me before. I can't possibly accept such formalities from you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackie was taken aback, and a wave of gratitude washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hadn't forgotten his kindness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackie replied earnestly, "It's only right! The Grand Elder of the Prophet Alliance has instructed us that you're to be treated as our most honored guest and friend. As merely a junior member in the Alliance, it's my duty to show you respect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was once again surprised, thinking, "What exactly has the Grand Elder of the Prophet Alliance foreseen to issue such instructions, treating me as their most honored guest and friend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though puzzled, Osborne knew this could only be beneficial for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "I'm humbled by the Grand Elder's high regard. I must visit and thank him in person when the opportunity arises."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After personally pouring Jackie a glass of water, Osborne turned his attention back to Eddie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Pike, let's discuss business. Before I reveal the source of the calamity, may I ask about the Prophet Alliance's strength? How many Transcendent Deity warriors can you deploy? How about Superior Deity warriors?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eddie hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, the strength of the Prophet Alliance was a tightly guarded secret. Revealing such information could be risky, leaving them vulnerable if Osborne ever turned against them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, recalling the Grand Elder's words to treat Osborne like their most honored guest, even as respectfully as the Elder himself, Eddie decided to be forthcoming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather, without awakening our elders who exceed Transcendent Deity status, the Prophet Alliance can currently field about twenty Transcendent Deity warriors and fifty Superior Deity warriors."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pride flickered in Eddie's eyes as he spoke, echoed by the expressions on the faces of the other members of the Prophet Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their view, such strength was more than capable of impressing Osborne.</span></p><div class="pagination">
