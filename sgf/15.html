  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was truly a witch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But there was definitely a scheme.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne calmed himself and said, &ldquo;Isa, please be serious. I&rsquo;m not that kind of man. Besides, I need to go to the hospital now to pick up my sister.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, Osborne was ready to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Isa glared at him and said irritably, &ldquo;I was just teasing you. I told you to come to my place because your sister was there.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne sighed in relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He almost thought that Isa&rsquo;s invitation was genuinely about getting intimate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luckily, he sensed something was off in time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was like a siren and known as the Night Witch for a reason. He never knew which of her words were true and which were a lie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With this thought, Osborne quickly got on the motorcycle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Isa said gruffly, &ldquo;Hold onto my waist tight. Don&rsquo;t fall. When did my charm become so ineffective? All this effort to seduce you, and you don&rsquo;t take the bait?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne gave an awkward smile and asked, &ldquo;What would happen if I did bite?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;If you bit, I&rsquo;d castrate you,&rdquo; Isa responded coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne felt a chill down below and dared not speak any further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Isa smiled smugly, and the motorcycle roared to life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon, they arrived at a small building in the suburbs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne let go of Isa&rsquo;s waist, looked up at the building, which was very old and covered in lush greenery, and noticed an even more ancient signboard hanging on the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Institute of Human Research.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Human research?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s brow furrowed deeply as he stared at Isa&rsquo;s back, full of suspicion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Was this woman really a legitimate doctor?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Despite his doubts, Osborne followed her inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although the building&rsquo;s exterior was ancient, its interior was beautifully and delicately decorated. Only a few janitors were sweeping, and there was seemingly no one else around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon, they reached a ward deep inside the building.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Your sister is here.&rdquo; Isa opened the door. &ldquo;Her illness is quite peculiar. I can&rsquo;t cure it right now.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne nodded, his gaze fixed on the frail, pale figure on the hospital bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That was his sister, Anastasia Augustine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was not his biological sister. He had found her near a garbage dump when he was ten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At the time, Anastasia was nearly starved to death. Osborne gave her the last half of a piece of bread. From then on, he had a sister. Ten-year-old Osborne and five-year-old Anastasia started their days of wandering together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They slept under bridges when tired, rummaged through garbage bins when hungry, and even fought with stray dogs for food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was a year later when they were finally taken to an orphanage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Whenever someone bullied Anastasia, Osborne would fiercely protect her, and every time Osborne was bullied, Anastasia, like a furious lioness, would fight desperately for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They were not real siblings, but they were closer than many who were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Osborne was admitted to university and left the orphanage, thirteen-year-old Anastasia didn&rsquo;t hesitate to leave with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne juggled his studies and part-time jobs to take care of her. Though it was hard, he felt happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In Osborne&rsquo;s heart, Anastasia was more important than anyone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Unfortunately, misfortune always struck at the weakest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Not long after, Anastasia fell ill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was a strange illness that could not be diagnosed, rapidly draining Anastasia&rsquo;s vitality and requiring a significant amount of money to keep her alive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A large part of the reason Osborne had accepted Ophelia&rsquo;s advances was to finance Anastasia&rsquo;s medical treatment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That treatment lasted seven years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Anastasia&rsquo;s condition worsened, her lucid moments dwindled, and not long ago, the hospital had issued a critical condition notice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;How long can my sister live?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s voice was somewhat hoarse and choked up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Isa calmly said, &ldquo;Without specific medication, she can only survive for seven more days.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Seven days?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne staggered, feeling as if his heart was being squeezed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He couldn&rsquo;t bear the thought of losing Anastasia in just a week.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But he quickly regained his composure. Shocked, he asked, &ldquo;Are you saying that with special medication, my sister could live longer?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Isa replied lightly. &ldquo;I am a top doctor. Don&rsquo;t doubt my judgment. Ordinary medicine no longer works on her, but those ancient remedies that are over a hundred years old can prolong her life. With enough longevity herb, she could live at least another year.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was overjoyed. &ldquo;A whole year?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Just a year, why the excitement?&rdquo; Isa shrugged. &ldquo;Prolonging life isn&rsquo;t curing. If you want to cure her, you&rsquo;d better complete the six challenges of inheritance within a year to upgrade your access to six stars. Only then can you send her to the Godfather&rsquo;s medical research lab. They have the most advanced medicine in the world, and that&rsquo;s the only place she might be cured.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What? You said cure?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s eyes widened as he grasped Isa&rsquo;s shoulders.</p><div class="pagination">
