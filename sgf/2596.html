  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone exclaimed, "Their battle has begun!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Seraphina launched the first attack, everyone became serious. When they felt the terrifying power of the arrow on the Blackstar Bow, many people's expressions changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man sighed, "Is this really the power someone below Empyrean Sacredness can unleash? Even a warrior at advanced Empyrean Sacredness might not be able to withstand it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A woman said in shock, "Her arrows are terrifying! My earlier thoughts were wrong. I used to think Osborne could withstand Princess Seraphina's three arrows if he gave it his all. But now, I realize I underestimated Princess Seraphina. I&rsquo;m starting to doubt if Osborne can even block a single arrow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another man agreed, "If someone with the same cultivation level as Princess Seraphina can block one arrow, it would already be something to be proud of."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina's attack had yet to fully unleash, but it had already shocked everyone. It's not that her attack power was truly overwhelming, but with Seraphina's cultivation level, such an attack could only be described as absurd.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A person at Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King can unleash a powerful attack that even someone at advanced Empyrean Sacredness finds hard to withstand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They could never have imagined this before. If they hadn't seen it with their own eyes, they wouldn't have believed it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, they all looked at Osborne with eyes full of pity, believing he was destined to lose. It wasn&rsquo;t because Osborne wasn&rsquo;t strong, but because Seraphina was too powerful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, at this moment, Osborne remained completely calm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt the power of Seraphina's arrow most clearly. It was indeed incredibly strong. If he had faced such a terrifying arrow from Seraphina during the zone duel, he might truly have struggled to withstand it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gave a faint smile and said, "You want to compete with me in archery, right? Then bring it on."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne drew the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A Sacred Power Arrow quickly formed on the Bloodwrought Bow, but it seemed far inferior to Seraphina's massive arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina sneered, "Osborne, I forgot to tell you something. My Blackstar Bow is the most powerful Supreme Sacred Artifact bow in the treasury of the Glorious Divine Kingdom. The combat technique I practice is also the most powerful archery in the Glorious Divine Kingdom, Twinkling Star Arrow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When the Blackstar Bow is paired with the Twinkling Star Arrow, their power doubles. The Twinkling Star Arrow consists of seven arrows, each stronger than the last. I hope you can hold on a bit longer so I can unleash the Twinkling Star Arrow a few more times."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Seraphina's expression turned serious. "The first arrow of Twinkling Star Arrow! Twinkle!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina released the Blackstar Bow's string. Instantly, the massive arrow shot out, swiftly heading toward Osborne on the other side of the arena. Like a twinkling star, its speed increased with every flicker.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the blink of an eye, it was close to Osborne, and Osborne began his attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Twinkling Star Arrow? Then let's see whether your Twinkling Star Arrow is stronger or my self-created Solar Sacred Arrow. Solar Sacred Arrow, Human Arrow, Single-Arrow Launch!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, he released the string of the Bloodwrought Bow. A Sacred Power Arrow shot out, its speed surpassing Seraphina's Twinkling Star Arrow. After all, Osborne possessed spatial power. By integrating it into the Sacred Power, his Sacred Power attacks could also traverse space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, speed doesn't mean greater power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina let out a cold laugh, completely indifferent, as if she could already see her Twinkling Star Arrow piercing through Osborne's Sacred Power Arrow, striking Osborne's body, and severely injuring him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "A championship battle? He wants to compete with me for the championship? How ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Seraphina was extremely confident. However, her confident expression quickly disappeared as her Twinkling Star Arrow collided with Osborne's Sacred Power Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Compared to the massive Twinkling Star Arrow, Osborne's Sacred Power Arrow seemed tiny, as if it couldn't withstand a single blow. However, the moment they collided, it was like two volcanoes crashing together at incredible speed, triggering a terrifying explosion instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Amid the deafening roar, Seraphina's Twinkling Star Arrow and Osborne's Sacred Power Arrow exploded simultaneously. The overflowing energy surged in all directions, creating an apocalyptic scene on the arena.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But soon, the energy dissipated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina's Twinkling Star Arrow and Osborne's Sacred Power Arrow failed to shatter each other and exploded simultaneously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation left everyone utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina's Twinkling Star Arrow, which even an advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior could barely withstand, ended up exploding simultaneously with Osborne's weak Sacred Power Arrow!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This indicates that Osborne's Sacred Power Arrow is about as powerful as Seraphina's Twinkling Star Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many people found it hard to believe, including Seraphina. She thought, "How is this possible? Osborne actually managed to withstand my Twinkling Star Arrow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Although this is only the first shot of the Twinkling Star Arrow, it was unleashed using the Blackstar Bow, a Supreme Sacred Artifact. Yet it was actually blocked by a shot from Osborne using the Bloodwrought Bow, a Superior Sacred Artifact?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina snorted coldly and said, "You do have some skill. Yunus and Matthew indeed couldn't defeat you. But unfortunately, you were still defeated by me in the end."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I just unleashed only the first shot of the Twinkling Star Arrow. The first shot is the weakest. Next, my Twinkling Star Arrow will grow stronger and stronger. I want to see how many shots you can withstand."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Seraphina launched another attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A massive black arrow reappeared on her Blackstar Bow, shimmering like a twinkling star, and shot toward Osborne once again, faster and more powerful than the previous shot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered, "You just used the first shot of the Twinkling Star Arrow, which is also the weakest. Coincidentally, I also used the weakest shot of the Solar Sacred Arrow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then let's see whose archery is stronger. Solar Sacred Arrow, Human Arrow, Three-Arrow Volley!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three Sacred Power Arrows quickly formed on the Bloodwrought Bow and shot out. They collided with Seraphina's second Twinkling Star Arrow, producing a terrifying sound and explosion before vanishing simultaneously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Osborne let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina's Twinkling Star Arrow is indeed powerful. Even its weakest first shot can threaten an ordinary advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the past, if Osborne wanted to unleash an attack of the same power and threaten an advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior, he needed to use the second form of the Solar Sacred Arrow, Earth Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the Phantomagic Realm of Stellar Region M72, when Osborne wanted to kill an advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior, he had to use Earth Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the situation is different now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After leaving Stellar Region M72, Osborne used twenty drops of Legendary Dragon Elixir and Perfect Dragon Elixir. His strength had already increased significantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His space, darkness, thunder, and fire elemental essence all broke through from primary Sacredness Level to advanced Sacredness Level. His body transformed to a level even he found monstrous, with strength great enough to clash head-on with Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even his soul power became so strong that it shocked Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under such circumstances, even though Osborne had not reached Empyrean Sacredness, his strength had already reached a level even he couldn't comprehend.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, he could now use the weakest Single-Arrow Launch of the Human Arrow from the Solar Sacred Arrow to kill an ordinary advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior without fully unleashing his Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he wasn't using his full strength, only the Sacred Power fused from space, thunder, and fire, though he had fused a total of six powers.</span></p><div class="pagination">
