  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gunshots rang out, and a vast sound exploded in Evelyn's ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could even smell the gunpowder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this death? There is no pain at all..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn thought to herself and couldn't help but open her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She saw that, right in front of her, a bullet was hovering there, strangely enough, less than one inch away from her forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bullet should have pierced her head, but now it stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn was not the only one who was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley was also taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gaped at the bullet, which was halting mid-air after being fired, then turned to Evelyn, blinking in disbelief and rubbing his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, the bullet still hovered there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley shouted and pulled the trigger again, aiming at Evelyn's head, emptying the magazine in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A couple of bangs were heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A total of seven bullets were fired, but each one stopped instantly as soon as it left the gun, as if there was an invisible wall of air in front of Evelyn, blocking all the bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, everyone was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the sound of crutches hitting the ground suddenly rang out from outside the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, an older woman with a cane walked in slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Wesley with a sneer on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the territory of the Draco Group. Boy, did you ask for my consent before you fired here? Also, a brat asked me to save them, so don't waste your energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With me here, even if you bring all the munitions from the Mayby City arsenal, you won't be able to hurt them at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the old lady finished speaking, the surroundings became extremely quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Serena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, deciding to help and recognizing he couldn't intercept Wesley's harm to Ophelia in time, promptly messaged Serena for assistance in rescuing them and stabilizing the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Serena appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gazing at Serena, Wesley experienced a shiver throughout his body. His status prevented him from reaching Serena's level. Hence, he was unaware of her identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But somehow, Wesley felt frightened when confronting her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His madness and anger disappeared in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you? Did you do this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley looked at the bullet hovering in the air, his voice trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena smiled faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then waved her hand, and all the bullets flew into her hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley was utterly dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So was Evelyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought she was doomed, but then an older woman appeared and saved her using strange and horrible means that she couldn't understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was this old woman a human or a god?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just stand where you are and wait for that brat to come. I'm old, and don't want to kill anyone anymore, let alone a group of ordinary people. Don't force me to do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena said so calmly, her eyes sweeping over the group of bodyguards from the Ashford family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group of people suddenly froze and dared not move anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene became extremely quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia trotted to Evelyn and looked at the slap mark on her face with a worried look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Evelyn, are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn nodded, trying to comfort her. "Ophelia, I'm fine! Are you okay too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia nodded, too, and asked in confusion, "Evelyn, who is she? Who asked her to save us? If it weren't for her, we would be screwed today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn tried to say something but didn't answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just looked at Serena and said in a trembling voice, "Madam, could you tell me who asked you to save us? Is... Is it him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's figure appeared in Evelyn's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sought help from Osborne alone, and it appeared that only Osborne might save them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Evelyn was not sure, afraid that she had misunderstood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena glanced at Evelyn, then stared at her belly for a while and said calmly, "Who asked me to save you? When he comes, you will know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn wanted to ask for an answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But seeing that Serena didn't want to say more, she didn't dare to speak again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was just looking forward to it vaguely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley had calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bowed to Serena and said politely, "Madam, I am Wesley from the Ashford family. What happened today is a feud between me and the Caldwell family. Please do me a favor and leave it alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Afterward, my family will show our gratitude."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, Serena smiled faintly, "Do you a favor? Who do you think you are? And </span><span>who do you think the Ashford family is? Are you worthy of my favor?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just stand there and don't move. I don't want to hear any more nonsense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley's face turned dark, but in the end, he didn't dare to say anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a little panicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know who asked this scary old woman to rescue Evelyn and Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What should he do if it was directed at him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten minutes passed quickly while Wesley was worried about the outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, footsteps were heard outside the door again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Steady, powerful footsteps drew everyone's curious gaze. Ophelia, Evelyn, Wesley, and others peered outside the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, a tall and slender figure appeared in their sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As </span><span>expected</span><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne!</span></p><div class="pagination">
