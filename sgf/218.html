  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news of Orion coming to propose caught Clarissa and Donna off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want to see him, get him out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa bit her lip, her face cold as she spoke, preparing to head back to her room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna, however, grabbed her with a wry smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, hold on a moment. I know what you're thinking, but Orion's status is not simple, and the Lark family is even more complex. Among the Skyefall's seven ancient families, the Lark family is the most mysterious and has the oldest lineage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And Orion, as the heir of the Lark family in this generation, displayed remarkable strength the other day on the viewing platform. He directly intervened to stop Derek's attack, showing power comparable to, if not stronger than, Apollo's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's here to propose to you. You can refuse, but if you don't even let him in, you might offend the Lark family. Moreover, even if you don't let him in, what's to stop him from going to your grandfather? As long as your grandfather agrees, whether you like him or not becomes irrelevant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, let's have him come in, see what he has to say. If we can convince him to give up, that would be ideal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa clenched her lips and eventually nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, let him in! But no matter what he says, I will absolutely not agree!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Clarissa took out her phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She murmured, "Osborne, where are you? Why haven't you returned yet? Someone has come to propose to me, aren't you worried at all?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, at Isa's Institute of Human Research, Osborne sat quietly in his room, surrounded by a rich orange glow that fluctuated continuously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each fluctuation, Osborne's face grew somewhat pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, the orange glow began to transform, becoming incredibly bright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned into a dazzling golden hue!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne opened his eyes, filled with excitement, exhilaration, and a hint of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I finally did it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The process was so dangerous, especially when merging the lightning elemental essence. The exploding elements nearly tore my body apart! Luckily, my Satan's Eye intervened in time, stabilizing the fusion process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I've successfully merged four elemental essences to form a brand new level three yellow Devil's Light!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Level three Devil's Light... so powerful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the power of the Devil's Light within him, Osborne couldn't help but feel exhilarated. Despite the risks during the fusion process, his gains were immense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Level three Devil's Light... even in the Augustine family's thousands of years of heritage, not many have possessed level three Devil's Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But I have achieved it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, I feel this isn't my limit. I can continue to merge other elemental essences to create an even more potent Devil's Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps surpassing the mightiest ancestors and forging a level four or even five Devil's Light isn't impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, I've run out of elemental essence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing up, Osborne realized that his level three Devil's Light was at least ten times more potent than his level one Devil's Light. Without needing to test it, Osborne knew that he could easily defeat a Class B metahuman now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he unleashed all his cards, even defeating a Class B+ metahuman became possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pondered, "I need to break through to the next realm as soon as possible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent, Vincent, Owen, and Emma from the Augustine family are all power masters, while I'm not even at Class B. My level is too low.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a Class B realm, coupled with my level three Devil's Light, I would likely be able to handle anyone below a power master. It would provide me with some self-defense capabilities. I just don't know how the soul of powers would take shape."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only then that Osborne picked up his phone, realizing he had numerous missed calls and messages, most of them from Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two whole days to merge with elemental essences? And Clarissa has been calling me non-stop. What on earth is going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hurriedly checked his messages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face darkened as he read through the updates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Orion?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I finally killed Apollo, and now a guy named Orion is showing up? He's gone to the estate to propose to Clarissa? This is madness!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, wait for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly gathered his things and, after a moment of thought, placed the Death's Edge into a wooden box. He stashed it in the trunk of his car and drove towards the Radcliffe Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Radcliffe Manor, Orion finally met Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sight of the aloof and majestic beauty before him, Orion's eyes lit up, and a smirk appeared on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was renowned as the most beautiful woman in Skyefall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if she wasn't the Fatebearer of the Radcliffe family, suitors were constantly lining up to win her favor. Not even someone like Orion, heir to an ancient family, could resist her allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He licked his lips, his resolve strengthening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "This woman! I must have her! Not only will her fate power help propel me to new heights, but I also will make her my personal slave in bed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these thoughts in his mind, Orion's face was filled with a confident grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Donna Radcliffe, Ms. Radcliffe, I hope you'll excuse the intrusion. I won't beat around the bush&mdash;I'm here to propose to Ms. Radcliffe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then waved his hand, and a dimensional rift opened in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the rift, a massive iron chest emerged, clanking as it settled onto the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These are the gifts I've prepared for the proposal."</span></p><div class="pagination">
