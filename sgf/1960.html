  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The grand and commanding voice echoed throughout the Supreme Sovereign City, resonating with every single member of the Paramount Supreme Clan. An electrifying wave of excitement surged through the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In one month, we will initiate a full-scale attack on the West Zone's Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Within three months, we must seize control of the West Zone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone who dares to resist will be mercilessly slaughtered!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the voice of their great leader, the esteemed Lord Malevolence! He had finally reappeared and issued precise, unyielding orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Countless warriors from the Paramount Supreme Clan rushed out of their residences, their eyes blazing with fervor as they gazed up at the towering spire in the heart of the Supreme Sovereign City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, seven powerful figures emerged at the base of the tower, their presence a testament to strength and dedication.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They bowed their heads in reverence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Icy One!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Icy Two!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Icy Three!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Icy Four!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Icy Five!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Icy Eight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Icy Nine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together, they proclaimed, "We greet you, esteemed Lord Malevolence, and congratulate our lord on your recovery!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These seven were all members of the Nine Dark Sovereigns under Lord Malevolence. The absent Icy Six and Icy Seven remained on the battlefield at the border of the West Zone, leading the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a calm yet authoritative tone, Lord Malevolence called out, "Rise. Enter and speak."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, the seven entered the tower. Lord Malevolence sat upon an enormous throne, its ebony surface swirling with a faint mist, exuding an aura of mystery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was shrouded in thick, dark fog, with only his piercingly sharp eyes visible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scanned the group below, his gaze settling on Icy Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Icy Nine, you bear injuries?" Lord Malevolence inquired coolly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine shuddered, then replied with the utmost respect, "Esteemed Lord Malevolence, I had ventured into Epochal Divine Peak with my men to request some Miracle Elixirs from a clone of Creation Herald, hoping it would help expedite your recovery. Much to my dismay, this Creation Herald clone refused my request. When I pressed the issue, I initially managed to suppress him with Osric's assistance. However, just when I was about to secure victory, a mysterious individual launched a surprise attack on Osric, seriously injuring him. Unable to fend off the Creation Herald any longer, I too was wounded in the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osric, along with over 20 of our Paramount Supreme Clan warriors, fell to the Creation Herald's hand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My lord, it's my fault! Please bestow your punishment upon me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bowing low, Icy Nine felt a wave of trepidation wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King, he felt as small and helpless as a child seeking forgiveness before Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence stared at him, his silence growing heavy and oppressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chilling atmosphere settled in the hall, freezing the breath of everyone present, including Icy One, Icy Two, and the others, who trembled under the weight of their leader's gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hastily prostrated themselves on the floor, fear coursing through their veins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long silence, Lord Malevolence finally spoke, his voice echoing with authority, "Rise. Icy Nine, you've made a grave mistake!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You deserve punishment for this! The Creation Herald is a being even I fear! If it weren't for him being entangled with that tree, who knows who would have controlled this Celestara? Even now, with only his clone able to act, you had no business provoking him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How reckless to pressure him for Miracle Elixirs. It's practically a death wish! Thankfully, the Creation Herald spared my dignity, or you wouldn't have made it back alive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because of your foolishness, Osric and the others died in vain. You truly deserve a severe penalty! But since you acted to aid my recovery, I won't punish you further this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just remember this lesson. Moreover, I command you to avenge Osric!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished speaking, a menacing glint flickered in Lord Malevolence's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osric was a Supernal Deity King with life power. Had it not been for his efforts, my recovery wouldn't have been so swift! Now he has fallen to an ambush. You must avenge him! Have you discovered the identity of that mysterious attacker?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine quickly replied, "While we can't confirm it yet, we have some leads! That mysterious individual used a Divine Ascendance Technique resembling the Gale of Netherworld from Jethro, the head of the Hudson family, which is the Dukedom Level Power of the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, this mysterious person can wield spatial power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We also received intel that the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings are hiding with the Hudson family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I'm almost certain that the one who ambushed Osric is likely the leader of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings, Theodore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Lord Malevolence fell momentarily silent, his brow furrowed in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings? Theodore? What's going on? Explain!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine hastily laid out the details.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, Lord Malevolence said, "Fascinating! The indigenous Human Community of Celestara is far from dead. They've got quite the luck!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems a few super geniuses have emerged. If given the time, they might just become a thorn in my side like the former Human Community's Seven Great Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I won't allow them the time to grow!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Icy Nine, I order you to head to the West Zone immediately. Before the full-scale war begins, find a way to eliminate the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can't locate them, then wipe out the Hudson family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Nine's eyes lit up with excitement. "Yes! I'll head to the West Zone right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Icy Nine swiftly departed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence turned his gaze to the other six, his tone calm yet commanding. "Prepare yourselves. Soon, you'll be heading to the West Zone to oversee the full-scale war!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The six exchanged glances, their bodies tense with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your Majesty, aren't you going to lead the charge in the West Zone yourself?" one asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence replied coolly, "Even without my direct intervention, you all are more than enough! With the God of Night absent, the God of Light alone won't be able to stop you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The God of Night suffered worse injuries than I did. I've only just recovered, and he's likely still not at full strength. I need to focus on regaining my peak condition for our final confrontation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He once said that when we meet again, it would be the true moment of life and death for us both. He intends to settle the disputes of Celestara once and for all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The God of Night is the only opponent worthy of my recognition in Celestara, and to win this battle, I must be at my absolute best!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Lord Malevolence spoke, Icy One and the others exchanged glances, their surprise evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't expected the God of Night to command such serious attention from the esteemed Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they held their tongues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rest assured, my lord! We will achieve victory in the war against the Human Community! We will personally breach the West Zone and take down the Sanctum of Light..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, Lord Malevolence smiled, "After breaching the Sanctum of Light, make sure not to kill the God of Light! I find her quite intriguing..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One and the others quickly exited the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence moved to the window, murmuring to himself, "God of Night, I can hardly wait for this final battle! Where are you now?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
