  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hah, let's see just how tough you really are!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George sneered, noticing Osborne's determination to keep silent even under intense pain. Anger flashed across George's face, and he intensified his torment, pushing Osborne to his limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the God Binding Rope had suppressed Osborne's powers, his body remained remarkably strong. He could endure pain far beyond what an ordinary person could handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what George did to him, Osborne clenched his teeth and remained silent, eventually shutting his eyes altogether.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if the one being tortured wasn't him at all, which only fueled George's rage further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Osborne's body bore the marks of brutal punishment, bruises, and cuts marring his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George's expression shifted from anger to concern; he feared he might push Osborne too far and end up killing Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a frustrated huff, he finally relented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George said, his voice dripping with disdain, "Stubborn, are we?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, we'll take our time. Since you're in my clutches, I have plenty of ways to make you suffer! I'll spread the word first, and then I'll come back to deal with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, George strode out, leaving Osborne alone in the dim light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once George's figure disappeared, Osborne slowly opened his eyes, the pain coursing through his body, igniting fury in his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He muttered under his breath, "George, huh?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'd better pray I never escape, or I'll repay this torment tenfold!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He began to assess his injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain was nothing he couldn't handle; none of the wounds were life-threatening. Even with his powers sealed, Osborne's body's resilience meant he would heal quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The real challenge was figuring out how to break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo was using him as bait to lure Sebastian, and Osborne knew that once Sebastian got wind of his predicament, Sebastian would rush to his rescue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he was Sebastian's grandson, the last direct descendant of the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Sebastian was still recovering from his injuries. If he showed up here, he'd be no match for Gerardo and could easily end up dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that happened, everything would be over&mdash;the Augustine family, the Draco Group, and Osborne's own value would vanish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The best outcome would be his own death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to find a way out of this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt the God Binding Rope tightening around him, suppressing his powers completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could sense its presence, a divine artifact capable of restraining even deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his Class AAA strength, breaking free was utterly impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without any power, Osborne couldn't fight back&mdash;not even against the iron cage that held him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What am I going to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He forced himself to calm down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo had mentioned he would wait five days. If Sebastian didn't show up by then, he would turn Osborne into a war puppet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, Osborne would never submit, so he had to devise a plan to escape within that timeframe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe the Blood Cross can help me!" Osborne whispered, focusing on the Blood Cross within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This divine artifact had fused with his very being, yet it too was suppressed by the God Binding Rope. While he could sense its presence, he couldn't activate it or harness its power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne refused to give up. He concentrated, trying to establish a connection with the Blood Cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time seemed to stretch on as he focused, and just when Osborne felt like he was reaching a breaking point, he sensed a flicker of movement from the Blood Cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, joy surged through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It really works! While I can't connect with Blood Cross completely yet, I can feel its reaction. If I can establish that link, there's no way I can't escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pressed on desperately, his determination ignited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, at the Campbell headquarters, the massive conference room was enveloped in heavy silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone sat frozen as they processed the fact that Gerardo had forcibly taken Osborne right before their eyes, leaving them powerless to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Wesson's projection flickered to life in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are we going to do, Wesson?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne's been taken by Gerardo! We have to rescue him!" Serena </span><span>exclaimed,</span><span> her voice tinged with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson's expression was grim. "Believe me, I want to. But how do we rescue him? Do you even know where he is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena fell silent, her resolve shaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then we'll storm the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' den&mdash;wipe them out, every last one of them!" First's voice cut through the tension, cold and resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, every Blood Demon member stood up, a fierce hunger for vengeance burning in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had all been transformed into vampires by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The upside is that their strength surged rapidly, with virtually no barriers to their power. However, the downside is that their lives were now intricately linked to Osborne's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne died, they would follow him into the grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was their king!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First continued, his voice unwavering, "Think it over if you want. But we're Blood Demon&mdash;all of us are heading straight for the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>, ready to fight to the last breath. It's either they die, or we do!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
