  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne became serious. The Ascending Sacred Sanctum ultimately couldn't hold on. Its shield completely collapsed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For the current Ascending Sacred Sanctum, being able to withstand three attacks from Isidore, an advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior, was already impressive, unless the Warfare Ancient Tree could completely repair it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, even though the Warfare Ancient Tree is extraordinary, completely repairing the Ascending Sacred Sanctum would require a significant amount of time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, it's already too late.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What should I do?" Osborne quickly turned his head to glance at Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could clearly feel that the auras of the three had already merged significantly with the aura of the Elven Mother Tree, but complete fusion would still take some time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Isidore clearly wouldn't give them that time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's not worry about the Ascending Sacred Sanctum for now. We must kill Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood first. We absolutely cannot let them merge with the Elven Mother Tree," Isidore roared angrily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, he charged straight at the three of them, his eyes filled with killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't stop him at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The defensive shield of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum had completely collapsed. Osborne needed time to reopen the shield. But that amount of time was enough for Isidore to kill Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood ten times over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne bit his lower lip, feeling extremely anxious and furious, thinking, "What should I do?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood were killed by Isidore, it wouldn't matter. After all, Osborne had already copied their life essences and could revive them later.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the key issue is, if they die, they won't be able to merge with the Elven Mother Tree, nor can they harness its power to create a passage out of Elf City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that case, Osborne wouldn't be able to leave Elf City and might even be captured and killed by Isidore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And if he dies, who will revive Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was extremely anxious at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go to hell!" Isidore's expression was extremely ferocious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His attack had already reached near Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood. As long as he struck them, he could immediately stop them from merging with the Elven Mother Tree, or even seriously injure them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, something else happened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a buzzing sound, an incredibly massive and peculiar tree suddenly appeared near Uriah. Immediately, a dense fog emerged, enveloping Uriah and Osborne along with the others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That tree was the Warfare Ancient Tree! And the fog was the Warfare Mist!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At such a critical moment, the Warfare Ancient Tree actually left Osborne's Soul Current Ocean, then came outside and released the Warfare Mist to protect Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a boom, Isidore's attack was blocked by the Warfare Mist. The Warfare Mist began to shake violently but did not break; instead, it completely absorbed Isidore's attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?" Isidore was utterly shocked. "What is this thing? Damn it! Whatever you are, you won't stop me from killing them. Let's attack together and break this damn mist."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isidore's temper was fully exposed. His expression was extremely anxious. He could feel that the fusion between Uriah, Hilaria, Sherwood, and the Elven Mother Tree had reached the most critical moment. If he couldn't break through the mist and stop their fusion in time, it would be even more impossible for him to obtain the Elven Mother Tree in the future.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Isidore attacked the Warfare Mist frantically. However, the Warfare Mist at this moment was personally cast by the Warfare Ancient Tree, almost as powerful as the defensive shield of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Isidore and the attacks of over a dozen warriors at Empyrean Sacredness could make the Warfare Mist tremble, they couldn't break it in a short time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation instantly made Osborne very happy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ultimately, you still need me to save you." At this moment, Primordial, transformed into a little </span><span>treant</span><span>, flew in front of Osborne and said, "I was the one who brought out the Warfare Ancient Tree. If not for the Warfare Ancient Tree, the fusion of those three with the Elven Mother Tree would have already been disrupted. So, you should thank me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately looked at Primordial with gratitude. This time, Primordial had indeed helped him a lot by actually bringing out the Warfare Ancient Tree to fight for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This shouldn't have any impact on the Warfare Ancient Tree, right?" Osborne asked with some concern.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial smiled and said, "Of course, it has an impact. Now, the Warfare Ancient Tree has merged with you, and all its energy comes from you. But since it hasn't been long since the fusion, the power it's consuming now is all from its previous reserves. Once this power is used up, it won't replenish."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This will weaken the Warfare Ancient Tree. So, unless it's absolutely critical, we can't let the Warfare Ancient Tree come out to fight. Unless you become stronger and can provide more power to the Warfare Ancient Tree."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne breathed a sigh of relief, thinking, "The Warfare Ancient Tree only consumed some power this time. In the future, I need to work harder to help it replenish quickly. As long as the foundation of the Warfare Ancient Tree isn't affected, it's fine."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Isidore was frantically attacking the Warfare Mist. Dozens of Elf Race warriors at the Empyrean Sacredness level appeared, coordinating with Isidore in a relentless assault.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne could clearly feel the power of the Warfare Ancient Tree depleting rapidly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne felt a bit worried again, thinking, "If even the Warfare Ancient Tree can't withstand their attacks, and the Warfare Mist gets broken, then we're really in trouble. You all must hurry up!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Uriah, Hilaria, and Sherwood, Osborne could only hope they would quickly complete their fusion with the Elven Mother Tree. Otherwise, they would all die here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the relentless attacks of Isidore and dozens of warriors at the Empyrean Sacredness level, the Warfare Mist of the Warfare Ancient Tree finally couldn't hold on. It was gradually breaking and about to collapse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth and activated the Ascending Sacred Sanctum again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the defensive shield of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum was restored. Working together with the Warfare Ancient Tree, it finally managed to withstand the attacks of Isidore and the other warriors once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, at this rate, they would not be able to hold out for long.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Osborne's Sacred Crystal was running low.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>During the city duel, he won 1.3 million Sacred Crystals from the casino. Over this period, he had already consumed hundreds of thousands to power the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne discovered that there were only over 400,000 Sacred Crystals left in the internal space of Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And each attack from Isidore and the other warriors forced the Ascending Sacred Sanctum to burn at least 50,000 Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After withstanding at most eight more attacks, Osborne's Sacred Crystals would be depleted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, without the support of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, the Warfare Ancient Tree would be unable to withstand the attacks of Isidore and so many other warriors at the Empyrean Sacredness level on its own.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression turned grave. He had done his best, but it seemed he still couldn't manage it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "No matter what, my cultivation level and strength are too low. If I were at the Empyrean Sacredness level now, with the Ascending Sacred Sanctum and Warfare Ancient Tree, even if I still couldn't defeat Isidore, a warrior at advanced Empyrean Sacredness, I could hold out for a long time. My strength is too weak."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne craved power immensely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, the entire Elf City shook violently, and the energy between heaven and earth instantly became incredibly chaotic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The massive Elven Mother Tree was violently shaking its branches. Then, a bright green energy shot out instantly, targeting Isidore.</span></p><div class="pagination">
