  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Louisa said, pointing to the tallest peak in the center, "That mountain is called Mount Celestial Reach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's where the Godfather lives. Unless you have the Godfather's direct order, no one is allowed near that mountain&mdash;not even members of the main bloodline of the Augustine family. It's a complete no-go zone, so please don't try to approach it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne nodded as he looked at the imposing peak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mount Celestial Reach, huh?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Surrounding Mount Celestial Reach were six slightly shorter peaks, forming a ring around the central mountain. Each of these peaks was about miles apart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Louisa pointed to the six peaks and explained, "These six mountains are numbered from one to six, starting from the closest to Mount Celestial Reach. They are all residences for members of the main bloodline of the Augustine family. The peak at the far end, number one, is where members of the Wise Order reside. It's also considered a restricted area, accessible only to those with special permissions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mounts Two through Six are for the main bloodline members. The Augustine family's main bloodline currently has over four thousand members, most of whom live on these five mountains."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Louisa then pointed to the remaining five peaks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Among these, one stands out: the farthest one, known as Challenge Peak. It's where disputes among Augustine family members are settled. Challenges are held there, and it's also where any other ancient families or factions that come to challenge the Augustine family would compete.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Finally, we have Mounts Seven through Eleven, which are guest accommodation areas. Mount Ten is for the staff, while Mount Seven is reserved specifically for branch bloodline members of the Augustine family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll be taking you to Mount Seven now. You'll be staying in one of the luxury residences there for the duration of your visit."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Louisa's words gave Osborne a solid grasp of the Augustine family's setup in Newport City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His overall impression of the Augustine family's domain could be summed up in one word. Immense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Twelve peaks radiated out from the central Mount Celestial Reach, spanning several miles, creating a realm within a realm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mount Celestial Reach was the residence of the Godfather.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne had video-called the Godfather twice, and the dimly lit room he had seen was likely located on this very mountain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Estates on Mount One through Six were the main residences of the Augustine family's main bloodline.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mount Seven was designated for the branch bloodline members.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mount Eight and Nine were reserved for other guests, while Mount Ten housed those staff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne quickly absorbed the layout of the Augustine family's territory as Louisa guided him to the base of Mount Seven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The grandeur of Mount Seven was apparent&mdash;it was massive but not particularly steep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From the midway point up, a series of opulent estates were built, each with multiple luxury homes capable of accommodating hundreds of people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne counted ten such estates from halfway up to the summit, with those nearer the top being progressively larger and more luxurious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are we the first branch bloodline family to arrive in Newport City?" Osborne asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Louisa smiled and shook her head, saying, "Not quite. In fact, you're the last to arrive. Members of the other eight branch bloodline families are always here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Each branch bloodline family gets their own estate, with enough room for several hundred people. Your assigned residence is the Ninth Estate."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Louisa pointed to the mid-slope area.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne raised an eyebrow. "Ninth Estate? Can't we stay at the top?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Louisa looked slightly uncomfortable. "The First Estate at the top is already occupied. It's not impossible to arrange a stay there, but you would need to negotiate with the current occupants. The First Estate is home to the Yalynch Augustine family, who are very powerful and likely to refuse."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled faintly, saying, "The Yalynch Augustine family? They must be the strongest among the nine branch bloodlines, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Louisa nodded. "Exactly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, the branch bloodline in the Second Estate would be the second strongest, correct?" Osborne continued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Louisa nodded again. "Yes. The Second Estate is occupied by the Marcelin Augustine family. The Third Estate is home to the Ransford Augustine family. Both of these families have been growing rapidly abroad in recent years, almost rivaling the main bloodline in power."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Louisa's explanation made it clear that the estates were indeed ranked by the strength of their branch bloodlines.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne nodded, saying, "So, staying at the Ninth Estate means our Dampston Augustine family is the weakest among the nine branch bloodlines?" Osborne asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Louisa confirmed with a nod, saying, "For now, that's the case."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne sighed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even here, there were clear hierarchical distinctions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The nine branch bloodlines of the Augustine family were ranked by power, and the competition among them was fierce.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Perhaps it's this very competition that has kept the Augustine family so formidable and enduring, making it the oldest family in Rosmandi," Osborne thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As their convoy finally came to a stop at the mid-slope, the Ninth Estate lay ahead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Osborne stepped out of the vehicle, he immediately felt the weight of numerous gazes upon him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He remained composed, casually surveying his surroundings. He noticed that people from the nearby Eighth and Seventh Estates were watching them closely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ignoring the attention for now, Osborne led his group into the Ninth Estate to get settled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With the sixth heir test ahead, he knew he would be in Newport City for a while. There would be plenty of time to interact with the other eight branch bloodlines and even the main bloodline members in the future.</p><div class="pagination">
