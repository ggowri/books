  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The white tiger let out a thunderous roar that seemed to tear through the air and shake the very ground beneath their feet. Its overwhelming aura was so intense that an ordinary person would have been seized by panic, their legs quivering uncontrollably and their faces drained of all color.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne simply flashed a confident smile and nonchalantly waved at the colossal creature.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey there, little tiger! I just knew you'd swing by again!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Little tiger?!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The white tiger came to an abrupt halt, its eyes ablaze with a deadly combination of rage and bloodlust.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You audacious human anomaly! You're practically begging for death! I am Prince Atticus Connery of the White Tiger Tribe within the Sacred Tiger Clan! How dare you address me as a 'little tiger'? Originally, I planned to end you swiftly. But now, I'm going to savor the pleasure of shattering every bone in your body, pulverizing your flesh into fine dust, and making you endure the most excruciating agony imaginable before you finally breathe your last!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having uttered those menacing words, Atticus took a menacing step forward, his every movement exuding a palpable and chilling killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, wore a broad smile, seemingly unfazed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, he was cautious, having activated Satan's Eye to scrutinize Atticus closely.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, he let out a quiet sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Phew! This guy is just a projection! His power level is still at Supernal Deity King, and he lacks any Sacred Power. Nothing to fear, then.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a calm demeanor, he replied, "So, you're named Atticus? You think you can crush my bones? I doubt you have it in you! Last time, you wanted to kill me, but you ended up running away with your tail between your legs. This time... I suspect it'll end the same way."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atticus' anger flared even more at Osborne's words. "You're too arrogant for your own good! The only reason I didn't kill you last time was that I underestimated your strength and wasn't prepared. But this time, I've come fully equipped to end you!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't belong in this world! In just a few months, you've jumped from Ascension One to Ascension Four. The Order of the Celestial Way won't allow you to continue rising! So prepare to die!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a roar, Atticus lunged, his massive claws slashing toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrifying claw marks came crashing down on Osborne like a hailstorm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer brute force behind the attack was so intense that it felt even more powerful than what an ordinary Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King could muster.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atticus' power is at least on par with an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King. Heck, it might even be on the level of an Ascension Nine one!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned grim.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne hadn't merged with the fragment of the World Tree, he'd be in a real bind. He'd have no choice but to rely on an absolute forbidden zone to bring Atticus' cultivation level down a notch. Then, Osborne'd have to go all-out just in the hopes of getting the upper hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But thanks to the World Tree fragment, things were a whole lot simpler now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No need for all those convoluted tactics!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne simply smiled and raised his hand, casually saying, "Little tiger, what are you trying to do here? Want to give me a high-five?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How polite of you! Come on, let's do this!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a massive palm print surged forth, meeting Atticus' claws head-on.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment their attacks collided, it sounded like a thunderclap.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atticus' claws shattered instantly, and Osborne's palm print, undiminished in power, continued its relentless advance toward Atticus.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atticus' expression hardened dramatically. "How is this possible?!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, he hadn't anticipated that Osborne could so easily shatter his attack.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught off guard, he barely had time to react before Osborne's palm print slammed into his enormous head.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thunderous impact, Atticus' massive head was nearly crushed, sending his enormous body hurtling backward.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He crashed onto the Ascension Stairway, lying there for several moments, unable to rise.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, little </span><span>tiger</span><span>! What's going on? I hardly broke a sweat, and you're already flat on your face! You're not the big bad beast you claim to be, are you? Is this seriously the best the mighty Sacred Tiger Clan can do? Pathetic. I'm so underwhelmed. I mean, come on! When you stack up against the Sacred Dragon Clan, your so-called Sacred Tiger Clan looks like a bunch of kittens playing at being tigers. You guys are all bark and no bite."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's taunting words echoed in Atticus' ears, igniting his fury.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thunderous roar that split the air, Atticus bounded back up onto his paws. His eyes blazed like two pools of searing crimson, brimming with a murderous intent that locked onto Osborne like a heat-seeking missile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you, human anomaly! You're dead man!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you sling insults at the mighty Sacred Tiger Clan? Do you really think our clan is a pushover compared to the Sacred Dragon Clan?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to tear you to shreds! Mark my words!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fury coursed through Atticus' veins, propelling him forward in a wild, reckless charge towards Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne had sized up Atticus' capabilities from the get-go and remained completely unfazed. As Atticus barreled towards him like a freight train, Osborne simply let out a hearty laugh and calmly raised his hand once again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey there, little furball! You're not being very polite. Always going on about killing me. Well, let me tell you, I've got a short fuse! If your real body was here, I'd pluck you clean as a whistle and throw you on the barbecue. You'd make a delicious meal!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With a body as big as yours, I could stuff my face for a solid ten days!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his taunts echoed through the air, Osborne brought his palm crashing down once more.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It easily shattered Atticus' attack and landed square on the tiger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atticus went flying through the air like a ragdoll.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His once-proud form was now a mess, all disheveled and battered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a split second, the fierce determination in his eyes was replaced by a look of pure shock and confusion.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a powerful warrior of the Sacred Tiger Clan, a prince of the White Tiger Tribe!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even among his kin, he was considered a genius&mdash;young, yet stronger than many Empyrean Sacredness warriors.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he wasn't here in his true form, he had projected as much power as he could muster. Atticus was confident he could handle an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King, and he felt assured against even an Ascension Seven, Eight, or Nine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here he was, getting brutally beaten by a mere Ascension Four human!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't wrap his head around it, and the humiliation and rage surged within him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! I'll kill you! You filthy anomaly! You must die for insulting the great Sacred Tiger Clan! You have to die!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atticus launched himself forward once more, his body wreathed in an otherworldly, flickering glow. But he couldn't have cared less about that glow or anything else; all that burned in his mind was the fierce desire to rip Osborne to pieces.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a scornful sneer. "Who gives a damn about your precious Sacred Tiger Clan? You're itching to kill me? Well, I'll trash-talk you as much as I please! Enough of this yapping; you'd better hightail it out of here!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Osborne let loose another thunderous palm strike.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he put every ounce of his might into it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strike crashed down on Atticus like a meteor, shattering what little remained of his already pummeled form.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atticus let out a scream that was a blend of excruciating pain and unwavering defiance, the sound ringing out through the air.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You anomaly from the Human Community! Just you bide your time! I, Atticus, will be back! Next time, it'll be your end! You'd better steel yourself because I'll flatten you like a pancake!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll track you down, and when I do, I'll come in my true form and wipe you off the face of the earth!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahh!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
