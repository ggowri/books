She was like an unfathomable abyss, capable of handling any opponent with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remained indifferent to everything as if nothing could truly capture her attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she was so young.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought that even the most outstanding talents among the younger generation of Newport City's Augustine family couldn't compare to Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wondered, "Who exactly is Isa?</span><span> </span><span>Is she really just a trusted aide of the Godfather?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra kept insisting that she was the sister of Bryce, the pirate leader in Likreia Mountain. At first, Osborne thought she was lying, but over time, he began to believe it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra also mentioned that Bryce greatly admired Night Witch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Night Witch was Isa!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra's brother Bryce was the dominant force in these seas, commanding 8,000 elite pirates capable of standing toe-to-toe with Rosmandi's fleet. Even when surrounded by the fleets of neighboring countries, he emerged unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce was incredibly powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't know Bryce's exact level of strength, but he was certain Bryce was a Class A master and not just an ordinary one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, he couldn't have become the ruler of the seas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pondered, "Bryce is so powerful, yet he greatly admires Isa?</span><span> </span><span>Who exactly is Isa? What did she do to make Bryce hold her in such high regard?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't figure it out, nor did he dare to think too deeply about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he glanced at Isa's profile, he increasingly felt that she was unfathomable. He wondered, "Why would someone as enigmatic as Isa come to my side? And why is she treating me so well?</span><span> </span><span>Isa once said she had great expectations for me, but why?</span><span> </span><span>What exactly is the relationship between us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Osborne pondered, the more confused he became.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was curious about Isa's true identity but didn't dare ask her directly. So, he turned </span><span>to Kendra for answers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kendra, is your brother really Bryce?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra answered without hesitation, a proud look on her face, "Yes, my brother is Bryce! Everyone in Likreia Mountain knows this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra didn't seem </span><span>to be </span><span>lying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pressed on. "Do you know his level of strength?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, Kendra hesitated slightly. "I don't know my brother's exact strength. He's never told me, and I've never asked</span><span> about it</span><span>. But I know he's incredibly powerful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she smiled at Osborne. "Osborne, why are you asking about this? Don't worry. You saved my life, and my brother would never trouble you. He'd only be grateful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled wryly, thinking, "Bryce's sister was actually kidnapped by pirates and almost violated?</span><span> </span><span>If it gets out, it might become a joke, and Bryce himself might feel ashamed.</span><span> </span><span>And I just happened to save Bryce's sister while wiping out some pirates?</span><span> </span><span>Am I really that lucky?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shook his head and continued asking, "So, how old is your brother? You must know that, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I do! We're half-siblings, so he's much older than me. He's already forty-two this year, but he still looks like he's in his twenties."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne then casually probed for more details about Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, Osborne began to form a clearer picture of Bryce in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that Bryce was a powerful, serious man who treated his family well and was ruthless toward his enemies. Bryce was a true tyrant of the seas</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, when Osborne tried to learn more about Bryce and the Night Witch, he found out that Kendra didn't know anything more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Osborne noticed that Isa's gaze had grown colder as she looked at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly stopped, not daring to probe further into Isa's secrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, this way!</span><span> </span><span>I can feel that we're not far from that ancient ship, no more than ten miles away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Kendra spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne became excited, but when he saw the coastline ten miles away, his expression turned cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>T</span><span>hey had returned to Dampston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten miles ahead was Yougster of Dampston, a small town less than fifty miles from Pinchide City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The ones on the Ghost Ship aren't true pirates after all!</span><span> </span><span>There's definitely a powerful force from Dampston behind the Ghost Ship!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, his face grew stern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they approached within three miles, Kendra's sensing became clearer. She pointed in a direction ahead, speaking quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I can feel it!</span><span> </span><span>The person steering the ancient ship is right there! And there are more than a dozen powerful auras around him, four of which are particularly strong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Kendra looked ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There, she saw a private port.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the Paltrow family's port</span><span>.</span></p><div class="pagination">
