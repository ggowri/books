  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really have a good idea."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather nodded and said approvingly, "However, the cost of launching a full-scale war is too high, and it is easy for other superpowers to take advantage of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, I will follow your idea and try to find a solution."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coldness flashed in Godfather's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, "Godfather, are you going to do it yourself? Go to the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' territory alone and snatch the Divine Bone Crystal and the corpse of the ancient god?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather was surprised and said, "You are smart!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled and said, "You're as smart as your mother. You are right. I have decided to take action myself to snatch the Divine Bone Crystal and the corpse of the ancient god."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't this too risky?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned tightly, "The King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> will probably guess that you are going to do this, and will definitely be prepared, and even set traps. You are the pillar of the Augustine family. If you go to the enemy's territory alone, what if something unexpected happens? What about the Augustine family? What about the Draco Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Godfather smiled faintly, "If it were before, I wouldn't take such a risk. Like you said, I can't let go of the Augustine family and the Draco Group. But now, I don't care about taking risks anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?" Osborne wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather said seriously, "To be honest, you performed better than I thought. You have grown up. Even if something happens to me, I believe you can take good care of the Augustine family and the Draco Group!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Godfather patted Osborne on the shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, if I don't return, you won't have to continue the rest of the successor test! You will directly become the new godfather and take my place!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I believe you can do better than me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body trembled when he heard this, and he had a bad feeling in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather seemed to be telling him about his final affairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gritted his teeth and said, "Godfather, I still think it's better to launch a full-scale war against the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>! But it's too dangerous for you to go alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather continued to shake his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A war will lead to many deaths! This matter has been settled. Don't try to persuade me anymore. I will set out immediately after I have made all the arrangements."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only you know about this. Don't tell anyone else. Otherwise, other superpowers will know I am not in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> and take action against the Augustine family and the Draco Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, just continue doing your job, and leave everything else to Grandpa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa will pave the way for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm leaving!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Godfather stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> have obtained enough Divine Bone Crystals. Although they have withdrawn from the rare metal mining area, the war is not over yet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep working hard and grow up quickly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Godfather's body flashed and disappeared from Osborne's sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned tightly, looking worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still felt that it was too risky for Godfather to go to the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' territory alone to snatch the Divine Bone Crystal and the corpse of the ancient god.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he had no way to persuade or help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His current strength was still too weak!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Godfather and the King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> were Class S Supreme Overlords. Even though he was now strong enough to kill Class AAA warriors easily, he could not intervene in the battles between Class S Supreme Overlords.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Class S Supreme Overlord could kill him easily!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Strength! My strength is still not enough! I must improve my strength as soon as possible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gritted his teeth and muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Clarissa took Osborne's arm and comforted him, "Osborne, don't worry too much! Godfather is a legend in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>! He, a strong man, will not get into trouble easily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt relieved after hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, a legendary strong man like Godfather would not easily get into trouble! In this world, few people can make him get into trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe I'm too pessimistic."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly. He turned around, held Clarissa's hands, and stared into her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa, there is something I have never confessed to you. In fact, I am not an orphan. My parents disappeared shortly after I was born. My father's name is Theodore, and my mother's is Vivienne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And Godfather, </span><span>he's</span><span> my grandfather!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, Clarissa's body suddenly shook.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had sensed something unusual a long time ago. From Godfather's special attitude towards Osborne, she already knew that the relationship between Osborne and Godfather was not simple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when Osborne personally admitted that Godfather was his biological grandfather, Clarissa was still shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened her mouth slightly and didn't come back to her senses for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather was a legend of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, the boss of Draco Group, and the king of </span><span>Rosmandi's</span><span> underground world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was his grandson!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he was the only grandson!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Godfather grew old, Osborne would inevitably take his place and become the new Godfather!</span></p><div class="pagination">
