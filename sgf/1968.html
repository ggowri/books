  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had always been deeply concerned about the safety of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings. Unless he was confident of their victory, he usually kept them out of battles, fully aware of the risks involved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, combat risked everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they encountered a formidable opponent and he couldn't reach them in time to help, the guilt of losing them would weigh heavily on his conscience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had even toyed with the idea of transforming them into Blood Clan members, reasoning that once they became part of the Blood Clan, they would gain the immortality granted by the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But ultimately, Osborne restrained himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, however, his worries were eased. He no longer needed to force Anastasia, Zoe, and the others into such drastic changes. All Osborne had to do was replicate their life essence, and they could enjoy the blessing of immortality without any of the risks. What a relief!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolute guardianship!" he exclaimed, excitement bubbling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The third ability of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was indeed powerful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that was just part of the story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity had a total of five abilities, and without needing any urging, Osborne launched right into his explanations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The fourth ability is called&mdash;absolute forbidden zone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity can expend energy to designate an area as an absolute forbidden zone! Within this zone, no one can exert power beyond a certain limit! And that limit is determined by the Lotus itself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For instance, I could set a radius of sixty miles where no being can wield strength greater than that of an Ascension One Supernal Deity King! That means everyone in that zone, including me, would be capped at that level&mdash;or lower! Even if someone were initially an Ascension Four or Ascension Five Supernal Deity King, they could only unleash a maximum of Ascension One's power while within that radius!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished explaining, Primordial fell into thought once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, he exclaimed, "That's a bit overpowered, isn't it? At this level, who's really a match for you? Unless some genius from the Sacred Dragon Clan, Sacred Tiger Clan, or Angel Clan shows up, you'd wipe the floor with anyone at your level!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle at the truth of this statement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"True! But there are limits to how often I can activate this absolute forbidden zone. If an opponent's realm is significantly higher than mine, they could potentially break through the limitations and channel even more power. For instance, Ascension Six or Ascension Seven Supernal Deity Kings would still have restrictions, but not as severe; they could still tap into Ascension Two, Three, or even higher powers! I can only restrict their strength, not entirely subdue it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sighed, a hint of disappointment in his tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seriously? And you think that's not impressive enough? Ascension Six and Seven Supernal Deity Kings could easily take you down! But because of your absolute forbidden zone, their abilities would be nearly halved, maybe even diminished to Ascension Three levels. That gives you a fighting chance..." Primordial retorted, a tad incredulous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, a grin plastered across his face. "I'm not dissatisfied! I just think it could be even more perfect... if every opponent had to face me at equal levels, what a beautiful world it would be!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial simply shook his head, exasperated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know what? Just go sleep it off! Dream about whatever you like!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged and continued, "The fifth and final ability of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity is called&mdash;absolute fusion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolute Fusion?" Primordial raised an eyebrow, clearly puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mirrored his confusion. "I'm not entirely sure what it entails, but it seems to be a power that can merge different elemental forces together. For example, I have spatial power, dark power, and thunder power as my primary elemental affinities, along with divine power and physical strength. If I use the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, I should be able to fuse these powers and unleash them all at once! But can different powers really merge? Will they become stronger after fusing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A frown creased Osborne's brow as he contemplated this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial, however, was struck dumb, disbelief written all over his face. "Wait, what? The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity can help you fuse powers? How is that even possible? Why does it have that kind of ability?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback. "Why are you so worked up about it, Primordial? Is fusing powers really that difficult?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial exclaimed, his voice rising, "Of course it is! Do you even know what comes after the Deity King level?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes. "Of course! It's the Supernal Deity King! Have you lost your mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial retorted, exasperated, "You're the one who's lost it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Supernal Deity King is still a Deity King! I'm talking about what comes after that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned deeply, genuinely unsure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never encountered anyone beyond that level, let alone heard of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strongest beings he had come across, like Lord Malevolence, the God of Night, and even the Creation Herald&mdash;along with the Eighth World Tree offshoot&mdash;were all still within the Supernal Deity King tier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Above the Deity King level is Empyrean Sacredness!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Empyrean Sacredness means you've transcended the ordinary realm of power! An Empyrean Sacredness warrior can blend various powers together, creating effects that are exponentially greater than the sum of their parts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you now grasp how difficult it is to fuse powers? Typically, only those who have surpassed the Deity King level and reached Empyrean Sacredness can do that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And now, through the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, you're telling me you can fuse multiple powers? Even merging just two would significantly boost your strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's voice carried a hint of envy as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He began to wonder if the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity had been the first to emerge in that Chaotic World instead of the World Tree. Would the World Tree still be the ruler of that realm? Could it stand against the might of the Lotus?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The five abilities of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity sounded few, but each one was immensely powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Absolute defense!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Absolute control!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Absolute guardianship!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Absolute forbidden zone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Absolute fusion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these five abilities perfectly integrated into Osborne's own powers, his strength had transformed completely, even though his cultivation level hadn't changed at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the best part? This enhancement would benefit everyone around him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You spent five years communicating with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. I was secretly mocking you, thinking you didn't need to go through all that hassle. With my help, you could have forced a merger with the Lotus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now, it's clear that those five years were invaluable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the Lotus hadn't willingly shared its essence with you, you would have only gained a fraction of its abilities!" Primordial sighed, a mix of admiration and regret in his tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but feel relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There had been moments during those five years when he almost gave up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had persevered, and it had all been worth it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, it's time to get down to business! I need to copy the life essences of Anastasia, Zoe, and the Hudson family! That way, even if they die, I can bring them back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne finally stepped out of his contemplative state, ready to take action.</span></p><div class="pagination">
