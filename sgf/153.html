  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened?" Donna asked with a frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She participated in the formulation of the action plan, and Osborne was asked to check the situation first before finding the Hyena Gang and Raymond's location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once discovered, Osborne will contact the assault team and cooperate with the team to attack Raymond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest were supporting players.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They lurked outside the slums and waited for the raid to end. Whether the action succeeded or failed, they only needed to pick up the assault team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second Bodyguard Unit Harris was in was responsible for the backup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before the assault team acted, something had gone wrong with the second Bodyguard Unit, which made Donna feel that something was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris said quickly in an anxious voice, "Ms. Donna Radcliffe, the members of the second Bodyguard Unit suddenly fainted. The situation is critical now. We need&nbsp;backup!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? How could this happen? What did you do?" Donna raised her voice and frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris said anxiously, "We didn't do anything. We don't know why it happened all of a sudden. Oh, no! Their breathing has stopped! Ms. Donna Radcliffe, hurry up and bring some people over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Harris hung up the phone, apparently to participate in the rescue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna frowned. "How could they suddenly faint? And even their breathing has stopped. Could it be that they were poisoned? Did they eat something wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa said anxiously, "Aunt Donna, it is not the time to speculate. We have to save them. It is too late to send them to the hospital now. We must go there immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can save them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna frowned but finally nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "It's really bad luck. We haven't even started our action yet, and we've encountered such an accident. Let's go and rescue them. We can't let them affect our supporting plan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna didn't overthink it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris had worked for the Radcliffe family for quite some time. Donna did not doubt him but was worried that this accident would affect the plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took Clarissa and Barlyn and went to the place where the second Bodyguard Unit was hiding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she didn't know that she was approaching a plot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Osborne, his radio had already gone into silence, and he had no idea what was happening outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already entered the depths of the passage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had just passed a bend, and in front of him, there was a vast space, which was several dozen yards wide and more than ten yards high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This place looked like an underground fortification.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked ahead with a look of surprise. He saw a person standing in the center of this space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Raymond!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond seemed to have known that Osborne was coming. He looked in Osborne's direction with a sneer. "You are finally here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow. "You knew I was coming, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond smiled faintly and said, "Of course. Besides, I know that Clarissa and that old bitch will also come."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned. "What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond didn't answer but said jokingly, "You are Osborne Augustine, right? I led the team twice to attack the Radcliffe family before, but the two actions both failed because of you. Even Pamela was defeated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are going to die down here today! You dared to ruin the action of the organization. Humph, no one can save you! When you die, Clarissa and that old bitch will soon follow you to hell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, violent electric sparks suddenly surged around Raymond's body, making crackling sounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond was several dozen yards away, but Osborne felt his skin all over his body stinging, and his limbs were numb. His hair even stood on end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was lightning power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked stern and composed. He said calmly, "Since you knew I was coming, you still dared to wait for me alone. Aren't you afraid of dying in my hands?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raymond laughed. "I admit that you are quite powerful, but you vastly overrate&nbsp;your power. Even Donna couldn't defeat me. What makes you think you can do that? If it weren't for the Draco Group's Class B Defensive Soft Armor, I would have killed you with a bolt of lightning last time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Donna saved you last time, but this time, Donna can't even save herself. Even though you have the Class B Defensive Soft Armor, you will die today!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, it's time to let my lightning&nbsp;send&nbsp;you&nbsp;to go to&nbsp;hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom! Suddenly, a terrifying rumble of thunder rang out in the vast underground fortifications, making Osborne feel pain and dizzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, a terrifying flash of lightning appeared above Osborne's head and slashed toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, a lot of thunder and lightning were gathering and striking Osborne. There seemed to be a crack in the air, madly pouring terrifying lightning toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression suddenly became solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't expect Raymond to put all his strength at the very beginning, trying to kill him in one move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne still had the same strength as a few days ago, even with the Class B Defensive Soft Armor, it would be impossible for him to withstand such a terrifying lightning attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the situation was different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted coldly and immediately activated the power of the Blood Cross tattoo on his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He roared, "Transform!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
