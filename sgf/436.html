  <div class="container"><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;What?&quot; Osborne asked.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Isa responded coldly, &quot;But with your current strength, I&#x27;m afraid you&#x27;re not yet capable of going up against the Paltrow family to snatch your girlfriend back.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne sighed inwardly.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In recent days, he had learned many advanced martial arts techniques from Isa. He had honed his Ninefold Tide Crash and Point Blank Force to a proficient level, and his Spiral Force had also seen significant improvement.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His strength had grown notably during this time.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If he were to face Medusa No. 6 again, Osborne was confident he could win easily, avoiding the struggle he experienced last time.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But Osborne knew his strength was still insufficient.</p><p style="text-align:left;">With his current abilities, the idea of challenging the entire Paltrow family and taking Clarissa away at Alexander and Clarissa&#x27;s wedding was simply impossible.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After all, dealing with Alexander would be a significant challenge.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Although Alexander had only recently become a Class A Power Master, his strength was formidable. Osborne was well aware that Alexander wasn&#x27;t just any Class A master.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Alexander was recognized as the most powerful person among the younger generation in Dampston.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne felt that Alexander&#x27;s strength was close to Class A+.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Moreover, the Paltrow family had Wade, who was even more powerful than Alexander.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Even if Wade wasn&#x27;t in Class AA, he was certainly in Class A+. Whether against Wade or Alexander, Osborne had no guarantee of victory.</p><p style="text-align:left;">However, even with slim chances, Osborne had to go.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Even if it meant risking his life, even if it meant he would die at the wedding, he couldn&#x27;t allow the ceremony to proceed.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After all, he had promised Clarissa that he would face the challenges with her.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Clarissa had told him that if she didn&#x27;t see Osborne at the wedding, she would choose to end her life.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne clenched his fists, his breathing becoming slightly rapid.</p><p style="text-align:left;">There were only ten days left until that wedding.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Time was running out for Osborne.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He thought to himself, &quot;Even with blood diamonds, it&#x27;s going to be impossible to significantly increase my strength in just these ten days.</p><p style="text-align:left;">My only way is to break through to Class A.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Only by becoming a Class A Power Master can I achieve a qualitative leap in my strength.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">However, it was an enormous challenge.</p><p style="text-align:left;">His soul of powers had been stuck at a height of ninety-nine yards, unable to reach a hundred yards, preventing him from breaking through to Class A.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Moreover, he didn&#x27;t have enough time.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Even if he could break through and become a Class A Power Master within ten days, it would be hard for him to stabilize his strength. Just after breaking through, his power would be unstable, which might weaken him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Isa, is there any way I can quickly enhance my strength in a short time?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Ultimately, Osborne turned to Isa for help.</p><p style="text-align:left;">In his mind, Isa was capable of anything. No matter what the problem was, as long as she was in a good mood, she could solve it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Isa sneered, &quot;You want me to help you enhance your strength, and then help you save your girlfriend? Do you really think I&#x27;d do something so foolish?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne was stunned for a moment, then nodded.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Isa, isn&#x27;t doing foolish things exactly what you&#x27;ve always been doing?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Isa, furious, glared at him, then turned away, refusing to look at him.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne walked up behind her and hugged her from behind.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Isa, you must have a way, right? I know there&#x27;s nothing in this world that you can&#x27;t do.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Isa&#x27;s face turned bright red. Coldly, she said, &quot;Stop flattering me! If I could do anything I wanted, could I make you give up saving your girlfriend from the Radcliffe Manor?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne bit his lip and said firmly, &quot;Isa, of course you could! With your strength, you could stop me anytime and prevent me from going anywhere! But I know you won&#x27;t do that because you&#x27;re not that kind of person.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;After all, you know that doing so would make me sad, and you don&#x27;t want to see me sad.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Hearing Osborne&#x27;s words, Isa froze.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Her face flushed even more. After a while, she struggled to push Osborne away, angrily saying, &quot;Ugh, you&#x27;re so annoying!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Then, she said coldly, &quot;I do have a way to quickly enhance your strength in a short time, but it&#x27;s extremely dangerous and has never been tried before.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Moreover, I don&#x27;t even know if it will work. If you fail, even I might not be able to save you. And even if you survive, all your martial arts and power abilities could vanish, leaving you as nothing more than an ordinary person.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;To be honest, I don&#x27;t recommend you try this.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;With your talent, if you continue training in the normal way, you&#x27;re bound to become one of the world&#x27;s top powerhouses. You might even catch up to my level in the future.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Are you sure you want to risk it all for Clarissa?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">After saying that, Isa looked at Osborne seriously.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne, full of excitement, eagerly said, &quot;Isa, you really have a way? Tell me quickly. No matter how dangerous it is, I have to try!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Hearing this, Isa became furious. &quot;Don&#x27;t you cherish your life? If you fail, you could die! Is Clarissa really more important to you than your life?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Osborne&#x27;s expression turned very serious.</p><p style="text-align:left;">He replied earnestly, &quot;Isa, you&#x27;re right. Clarissa is indeed more important to me than my life! And it&#x27;s not only her but also you!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;If it were you in that situation, I would also do anything, even risking my life, to save you!&quot;</p><div class="pagination">
