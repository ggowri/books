In the blink of an eye, dozens of executives and bodyguards of the Ashford family were killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Corpses fell to the ground one after another, and screams rang out instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the Caldwell family was terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they soon discovered that those who died were all members of the Ashford family, and no one from the Caldwell family was hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a moment, the last member of the Ashford family fell to the ground unwillingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the head of the Ashford family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After eliminating the Ashfords, Osborne lost control of the bullets, which clattered to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at every </span><span>Caldwell,</span><span> his eyes full of indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne considered using this chance to wipe out the Caldwell family as well, as they had mistreated him during the three years of his marriage to Ophelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, he gave up the idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No need!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't bloodthirsty, and the Caldwells' bullying didn't make them his enemies deserving of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, the Caldwell family would never dare to provoke him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said calmly, "You'd better not tell anyone about what happened today. Otherwise, if you're silenced, don't blame me for not reminding you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he waved goodbye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the last time I will save you.

Don't mess with me again, or I won't mind killing you all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finishing speaking that, he walked towards the door step by step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the corpses all over the ground, Osborne did not care. Serena would arrange for someone to clean them up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia, Evelyn, and others were still in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of the Ashford family's senior executives and bodyguards were killed just like that, and Osborne even just stood there without moving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of skill was this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was Osborne a god?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia was astonished to realize she barely knew Osborne. She believed Osborne was powerful, yet only now realized he exceeded her expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn thought so, too.

Can we go back to the past? I was wrong! I really know I was wrong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne ignored it, and his expression did not change, so he continued to walk out the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An expression of pain suddenly appeared on Ophelia's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne halted, faced her, and scolded her for shamelessness, she might find solace, as it would indicate she retained a spot in his affections.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Osborne hated her, she would be delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, no!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne did not respond, so indifferent as if he did not know her, as if he was telling her...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was nobody to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't care anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia clenched her teeth as tears flowed down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly shouted again, "Osborne, I won't give up! I will make up for my mistakes! I will never give up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Never!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Ophelia's shouts, Osborne still did not respond at all. He walked out coldly and soon disappeared outside the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia appeared exhausted, collapsing to the ground in confusion and despair, her delicate features etched with pain and remorse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelyn looked at Ophelia, hesitating, but ultimately said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia would never give up?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But </span><span>so</span><span> what?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't change anything now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps their disappearance from Osborne's world was the best reward for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia was right when she said that they were no longer from the same world!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had entered a higher-level world that they couldn't step into, no matter how hard they tried!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne left, and Evelyn felt desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne didn't know all this, nor did he want to know. He just wanted to return to the Radcliffe Manor for Clarissa and hug her tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia, his ex-wife, meant nothing to him now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His present and future would only have Clarissa!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ding-dong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Osborne's Draco Star Wristlet made a prompt sound, and Osborne was immediately delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My fourth successor test is finally completed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've been expecting it for a long time!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
