  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne was indeed watching Fabian with a mocking glint in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had known from the start that as long as he could hold out long enough, something would change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, he had thought that change would come from the slave market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, as a Super VIP of the slave market, he had just spent 120 million there, and they had promised to protect their high-profile clients.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had expected the slave market to intervene and stop Fabian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to his disappointment, they remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their battle was unfolding right in front of the slave market's doors, and if they truly intended to protect him, they could have acted long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, the slave market watched in eerie silence, showing no signs of wanting to get involved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Figures. The slave market is utterly unreliable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you had helped me, maybe I would have spared a few of you when I wiped out the slave market."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now... You're all dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once it became clear that the slave market wouldn't come to his aid, Osborne wondered if the Wild Flame Army might send someone to help him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he was still officially a squad leader in the Wild Flame Army, and having just broken through to the Celestial Deity realm, he would at least be considered a centurion according to their rules.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given his displayed strength and talent, it seemed plausible that the Wild Flame Army would intervene to stop Fabian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how formidable Fabian might be, in the eyes of the Wild Flame Army, he was nothing. With even a single member of the Wild Flame Army stepping forward, Fabian would have no choice but to slink away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But once again, Osborne was met with disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Wild Flame Army didn't send anyone to his rescue. The powerful figures residing in the Central floating mountain were likely watching the fight from above, yet none were willing to intervene on his behalf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wild Flame Army... One day, I'll turn all of you into my Blood Clan descendants!" Osborne thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze shifted to Oswald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't anticipated that the unexpected change would come from Oswald of the City Guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But upon reflection, it made sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The City Guard was responsible for maintaining order and stability throughout Wild Flame City. Their battle in the inner city, which had already caused damage to some buildings, fell squarely within the City Guard's jurisdiction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though not as powerful as the Wild Flame Army, the City Guard was undoubtedly one of the top five superpowers in Wild Flame City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the very least, if any members of the City Guard showed up, even a Deity Overlord like Fabian would have to back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian, unwilling to concede, pleaded, "Oswald, just give me a little more time! If I can have just five more minutes, I'll drain his divine power and take down this pathetic human. I promise my next attacks will be controlled&mdash;I won't destroy any more of Wild Flame City's buildings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oswald frowned and replied, "Fabian, do you really think you can take him down in five minutes? Think about it&mdash;he's been evading you for nearly twenty minutes, and he still has plenty of divine power left!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really believe you can drain him in just five more minutes? Even if you had twenty more, he wouldn't run out! Unless you can increase your speed, you won't be able to touch him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian was left in shock, his disbelief palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? That's impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian turned to Osborne, keenly sensing the fluctuations of his divine power. Despite the intensity of the situation, Osborne's divine power still felt robust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization left Fabian momentarily stunned. Meanwhile, a smirk appeared on Osborne's face as he continued to mock him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian's anger flared, but he felt utterly powerless. Just as Oswald had said, unless he could somehow boost his speed, he had no chance against Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't catch up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no way to exhaust Osborne's divine power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All Fabian could do was endure the humiliation of being toyed with. It was infuriating, but what could he do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless he could lure Osborne out into the wild.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out there, he would have the freedom to unleash his wide-range attacks without the constraints of worrying about collateral damage to buildings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such attacks might not kill or seriously injure Osborne, but they could certainly disrupt his speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the wilds, Fabian might actually stand a chance at catching him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought simmering in his mind, Fabian glared at Osborne and sneered. "You pathetic human fool! Are you brave enough to leave Wild Flame City and fight me in the wild?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne instantly recognized Fabian's intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a disdainful laugh. "Fabian, you're the fool here. Do you really think I'm as stupid as you? Why on earth would I leave Wild Flame City? Why would I agree to fight you outside? If you're so tough, why don't you just defeat me right here, right now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You said you could turn me into minced meat with a single punch. Well, here I am! Step up and prove it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm still standing fine&mdash;are you too scared to hit me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Osborne's scornful words hanging in the air, Fabian's fury escalated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to launch another attack when Oswald stepped in to stop him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fabian, cut it out!" Oswald's voice was firm, his expression hard. "I'm not interested in your personal vendetta, but as a general in the City Guard, I won't allow you to continue this fight within Wild Flame City!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, disperse and get out of here!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
