  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you know?" Osborne looked at Kendra expectantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I felt it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of hesitation, she added, "Actually, I have a power, but it isn't aggressive at all. I am extremely sensitive to energy. I can sense even weak energy from a long distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I sensed a sudden group of energy fluctuations three miles away. Over a dozen of them moved toward us, but one of them remained stationary for a while before eventually departing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are right. The ancient ship docked three miles away. Over a dozen people disembarked, and the ship stayed there. There should be one more person aboard. Upon realizing that something was amiss, he steered the ship away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was somewhat confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra's power didn't seem to be helpful in tracking the ancient ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said somewhat embarrassedly, "Kendra, your power is a bit unusual."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, he found Kendra's power simply unhelpful. Among the many powers, it was probably one of the most useless ones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> what if she could sense energy from a distance?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To escape earlier?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing Osborne's hesitation, Kendra couldn't help but smile, "Osborne, you don't have to be so tactful. I understand that my power is almost useless. My brother told me the same thing. However, I have more than one power. I have a second one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have a second one?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne became hopeful again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My second power is to track energy! Each person and object </span><span>emits</span><span> distinct and unique energy fluctuations. My power allows me to memorize these unique patterns and then track them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as something radiates energy, once I sense it, no matter where it goes, how far it travels, or how well it hides, I will be able to find it!" Kendra said with an extremely confident look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was already excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra's first power was her extremely keen perception of energy. She could even feel the slightest energy fluctuations several miles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And her second power was actually to trail energy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These two powers, once combined, would prove immensely valuable. At least for Osborne now, Kendra could definitely help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kendra, have you captured the energy on that ancient ship? Can you track it?" He asked quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Kendra nodded, Osborne couldn't help but beam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ghost Ship is doomed to be destroyed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression betrayed his cold intent to kill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ghost Ship? Osborne, were all those men in black who attacked you last night from Ghost Ship? Was the ancient ship you mentioned also from that organization?" </span><span>Kendra asked in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded and did not hide anything from her. After all, he would still need her assistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kendra, you guessed right. Those men, along with the ancient ship I requested your help to track down, were from Ghost Ship!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra was furious. "Of course I do, but I've never seen them myself. I've only heard my brother speak of them. His men faced Ghost Ship, which launched unprovoked attacks, resulting in heavy casualties among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My brother has been eager to destroy Ghost Ship for a long time, but they hide covertly and rarely show up, so he has never caught them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, if you are going to eliminate Ghost Ship, I promise to find them soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Kendra finished speaking, Osborne was stunned, wondering, "Could her brother really be Bryce, the leader of the Pirates in Likreia Mountain?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Does he also have a grudge against Ghost Ship?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, it was not the time for Osborne to figure out these things. He pondered for a while and said, "Kendra, if we take action tonight, can you still trace them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No problem at all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra said with assurance, "I have ingrained the energy fluctuations of the man on the ship in my memory. I'll never forget them, no matter how much time passes. Besides, I could locate his grave even after his death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was dumbfounded. This was a bit scary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having remembered someone's energy fluctuations, Kendra would track him down no matter where he fled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even death wouldn't grant him escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Kendra's power was utilized perfectly, it would undoubtedly be an incredible skill!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she were a police officer, criminals would likely quiver in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kendra, let's take action at night. I still need to make some preparations."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. Osborne, you can inform me anytime."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra departed, visibly pleased that she could assist Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He began to make final preparations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ghost Ship was very formidable. It was almost impossible to ruin it with his strength alone. Fortunately, he still had a trump card, Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her support, everything would probably go smoothly even if there was a true Class A master in the lair of Ghost Ship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can set off as soon as Isa gets the antidotes ready," Osborne murmured before taking out the blood diamonds to practice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at that moment, he suddenly heard a loud noise coming from outside the room.</span></p><div class="pagination">
