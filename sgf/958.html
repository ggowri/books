As Sebastian positioned himself in front to absorb Gerardo's assault, Osborne tapped into the Divine Bone power surging through his right leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, he wasn't aiming to attack; he was going all-out for speed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His foot slammed down into the ground, unleashing a burst of energy that propelled him forward with an unnerving velocity&mdash;so fast that even Gerardo didn't register the danger until it was almost too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo had underestimated him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought Osborne was simply looking for an early grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time Gerardo reacted, Osborne was just feet away, tension crackling in the air between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With every ounce of power he had stored up, Osborne unleashed a single, ferocious strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Slash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veins bulged across his body as he transformed into a fearsome Vampire, channeling the Breath of Celestial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Thundergod</span><span> Gloves added to his power, pushing Osborne to his absolute limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Goddess of Grain's scythe became an extension of his fury as he swung it like a reaping blade aimed straight for Gerardo's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was alarmingly swift!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Gerardo hadn't anticipated such an audacious assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his surprise, he quickly shrouded himself in a bubble of protective energy, confident that Osborne's blow wouldn't penetrate his defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, instinct kicked in, and he began to retreat while throwing a punch toward Osborne's chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's scythe descended with fierce intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Gerardo stumbled backwards, the scythe slashed not at his neck, but deeply into his chest. Harnessing the potent energy of Osborne, the strike cut through Gerardo's defenses with alarming ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, Gerardo retaliated, his fist crashing into Osborne and sending Osborne flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pain lanced through Osborne's chest as he felt the bones buckle, blood spraying from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simultaneously, Gerardo's pained howls filled the air as he staggered. A gruesome </span><span>wound was revealed in his chest, where the scythe had cleaved open flesh, leaving his heart perilously exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a little more, and that scythe would have split it in two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo had been ripped by Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood poured from the jagged gash, and the severity of his injuries forced him to retreat, howling in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's body landed in Sebastian's arms, who stared at his grandson, disbelief etched across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never expected Osborne would charge in against Gerardo, let alone deliver such a catastrophic blow so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How in the world did you dare to do that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you even pull it off?" Sebastian stammered, still reeling from the shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, don't worry about me! I'm not done yet! You have to take Gerardo down while he's vulnerable!" Osborne shouted, urgency flooding his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At those words, Sebastian jolted back to focus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he launched himself toward Gerardo, intending to capitalize on the moment when Gerardo was reeling from Osborne's fierce attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fierce battle reignited, with Gerardo severely battered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though weakened, he still managed to hold on; however, Sebastian pressed the attack relentlessly, forcing Gerardo into an increasingly precarious position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It looked like Gerardo was on the edge of defeat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne was far from relaxed. He extended his hand, revealing a single drop of blood hovering between his fingers&mdash;Gerardo's blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, his gaze as cold as steel, "Controlling blood is a natural ability of Vampires. With the Blood Cross, I wield the power of their forebears!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Burn!" Osborne commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, searing flames erupted from his palm, curling around the drop of blood. Simultaneously, Gerardo, still in the thick of battle, felt the scorching fire spreading through his body. Every drop of blood screamed in agony as it ignited, forcing another tortured cry from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That moment of vulnerability exposed him further, and Sebastian seized the chance, landing a brutal strike that flung Gerardo backwards, exacerbating his already dire injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne wasn't about to let up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lightning!" Osborne shouted, channeling electricity to strike at the very essence of Gerardo's blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, Gerardo's body sparked with electric energy, paralyzing him in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian pounced on the opportunity, pressing his advantage and hammering Gerardo with everything he had left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's situation was utterly desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Osborne manipulating his blood for the assault, every strike he faced felt like a direct hit to his own core. Though the attacks weren't fatal, he had no choice but to </span><span>respond&mdash;yet that only left him open to Sebastian's relentless barrage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the fight dragged on, Gerardo found himself increasingly battered and blood-smeared, every breath becoming a struggle, his life force waning.</span></p><div class="pagination">
