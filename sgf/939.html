  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the Wolf King was behind Osborne, his jaws a far more terrifying weapon than his claws. An attack from those powerful teeth could easily rip Osborne apart if he got caught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But, of course, Osborne wasn't about to give him that chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Osborne had been focused on taking down the Tauren King, his vigilance never wavered. After all, this was his Light Realm&mdash;the very domain resonated with his senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already picked up on the Wolf King's silent approach and the imminent assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the attack was unavoidable, Osborne remained calm. As the Wolf King lunged to bite, he spun around, swinging the Goddess of Grain's scythe with all his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the Wolf King's gaping maw was less than three feet away from Osborne, the putrid stench of blood assaulting his nostrils.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Wolf King's razor-sharp teeth, over a yard long, gleamed menacingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they sank into Osborne, the results would be dire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Wolf King wouldn't get the chance. With a lightning-fast swing, the Goddess of Grain's scythe cleaved through the air, slicing into the Wolf King's open jaws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, two of his sharp teeth fell to the ground, neatly severed by the scythe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, the Wolf King's tongue and the insides of his mouth were shredded, blood spraying everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a dimensional rift opened behind Osborne, swallowing him whole and allowing him to evade the splattering of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahhh!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Wolf King's howls of agony echoed as his immense body collapsed heavily onto the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne had used interdimensional travel to appear right behind the Medusa Queen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the shift in the air, the Medusa Queen was suddenly alarmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic surged within her as she tried to escape, but it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne swung the Goddess of Grain's scythe, effortlessly slicing through the Medusa Queen's defenses and into her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took off in a desperate sprint but soon realized something was terribly wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt her body tearing in two directions, terror flooding her eyes before they turned dull and lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's strike had cleanly bisected her before she could escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both halves of her body crumpled to the ground with a thud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile appeared on Osborne's face as he turned to face the still-howling Tauren King and Wolf King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, it's your turn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He began to walk toward them, stepping steadily as they glared back with a mix of rage and intent to kill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Tauren King's neck was nearly severed, blood gushing forth as he fought to retort, his eyes still radiating fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you'll meet a gruesome end!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The great King of the Aberrants won't let this slide! Soon, he'll roll in with a powerful army of clones to wipe out the Augustine family and the Draco Group!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't stop him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be waiting for you in hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled. "Take your time waiting. Once I've had my fun, I might just pay you a visit in hell and kill you again. Don't worry&mdash;I'll send Gerardo there, too, so you two can have a grand reunion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne swung the Goddess of Grain's scythe again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Tauren King's head was cleanly severed from his body, the light in his eyes fading away as his lifeless form collapsed to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne then turned his gaze to the Wolf King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Wolf King, having lost his tongue to the scythe, could now only produce garbled roars, glaring at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had no time for idle chatter with the clone&mdash;after all, it was just a manufactured being. He swung the Goddess of Grain's scythe, cleanly severing its head in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like that, the three Class S clones and the fifty Class AAA clones were all dispatched, not leaving a single one behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What an intoxicating surge of blood energy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt an exhilarating rush as he absorbed the thick energy surrounding him. While it couldn't compare to the massive reserves of the Dark Deity, the blood energy from three Class S and fifty Class AAA warriors was more than enough to boost the strength of his Blood Demon faction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the very least, many of the Class A+ Blood Demon members would have the opportunity to advance to Class AA, and there was a real chance for even more to reach Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Osborne activated the Blood Cross, drawing in all the blood energy to temporarily store it within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once that was done, he finally retracted the Light Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression turned a bit pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the Light Realm had its advantages, it put an immense strain on his mental strength. Osborne was only a Class AAA, so using a Level Four Light Realm was pushing his limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than ten minutes, he had already drained a significant portion of his mental strength reserves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the gains had been monumental.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only had Osborne amassed a substantial amount of blood energy, but he had also rescued over sixty members of the Draco Armed Services Branch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this was just the beginning!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were still many more from the Draco Armed Services Branch awaiting his rescue.</span></p><div class="pagination">
