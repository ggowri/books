  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Prince Chuck, the Grimoire of Sacred Artifact Forging is incredibly valuable!" Osborne exclaimed, his eyes wide with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chuck merely smiled, a hint of amusement in his expression. "Valuable? Perhaps. But when you weigh it against our lives, the Grimoire pales in comparison.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Besides, our Elf Race isn't exactly known for its prowess in forging Sacred Artifacts. Even with the Grimoire in hand for tens of thousands of years, no one has managed to fully grasp its secrets to actually create a Sacred Artifact.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In fact, there's a good chance the Grimoire might not even be genuine; it could be incapable of producing a real Sacred Artifact! However, the section on integrating Azure Ore into divine artifacts to enhance their power is definitely legitimate&mdash;it's been tested and proven.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But whether you can use Azure Ore to transform a divine artifact into a Sacred Artifact remains uncertain. Even if it's possible, you would need a staggering amount of Azure Ore. In the past, we simply didn't have enough to experiment with...</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Regardless, I truly hope the Grimoire proves useful to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded appreciatively. "Thank you! If one day I manage to forge a Sacred Artifact thanks to the Grimoire, I won't forget your generosity, Prince Chuck. I'll make sure to craft a Sacred Artifact to express my gratitude to you and the Sylvan Elf Clan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chuck's smile widened. "If that day ever comes, we'll consider it a win for us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a chuckle, Osborne stored away the Azure Ore and his Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Grimoire contained methods for integrating Azure Ore into divine artifacts, but he needed a quiet and undisturbed environment to focus, which clearly wasn't the case right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then pulled out a faintly golden crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This crystal was actually the eye of a Mud Golem, its energy faint and unimpressive compared to Azure Ore, making it seem rather insignificant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it hadn't been for his Satan's Eye showing a peculiar interest in it, Osborne might have tossed it aside long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's this?" he asked Chuck, curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elf City had existed in deep space for over a hundred thousand years, and its Royal Families held a wealth of knowledge that Osborne was eager to tap into. He hoped Chuck could shed some light on the golden crystal's true nature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chuck furrowed his brow, deep in thought, as if searching through his memories.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, he shook his head. "I've scoured the memory database for every type of treasure, but I can't find anything that matches this exactly!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are some similar items, but they all have slight differences. I can't say for sure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, but I really don't know what it is," Chuck admitted, a look of regret on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a twinge of disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joanna chimed in, her voice reassuring, "Osborne, Chuck knows a great deal about rare materials, potions, treasures, and even various creatures! I've practically worn out the library in Elf City! If Chuck doesn't know, then it's likely that no one else in Elf City does either.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There aren't many folks in the entire universe who know more about these things than my brother!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chuck looked sheepish. "I do have some expertise in this area. I even compiled a book called the Heavenly Compendium of All Beings, but this world is vast and complex, filled with many wonders from the Umbra World, so it's not surprising that there are still things I can't identify.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you need it, I can make a copy of the Heavenly Compendium of All Beings for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up. "The Heavenly Compendium of All Beings? That would be fantastic! Thank you so much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a small favor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, Chuck established a soul connection with Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost instantly, a torrent of information flooded Osborne's mind, revealing a treasure trove of peculiar materials, herbs, artifacts, and creatures he had never seen or even heard of before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was overwhelming&mdash;like an entire encyclopedia had been downloaded into his brain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was elated. He felt that the Heavenly Compendium of All Beings held even greater value for him than the Grimoire of Sacred Artifact Forging. After all, the Grimoire's ability to forge a Sacred Artifact was still uncertain, but the Compendium undeniably deepened his understanding of the world around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Heavenly Compendium of All Beings, whenever he encountered something unfamiliar, he could simply refer to it for information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For instance, Azure Ore, or the Soul of Umbra Earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, he had only heard the name "Soul of Umbra Earth" without any clue about its appearance, but now, thanks to the Compendium, he finally understood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Prince Chuck!" Osborne said sincerely, his gratitude evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gifts of the Grimoire of Sacred Artifact Forging and the Heavenly Compendium of All Beings were invaluable. Choosing to come and save lives had proven to be the right decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only had he gained twenty-eight pieces of Azure Ore, but he had also secured the friendship and promise of the Sylvan Elf Clan's Royal Family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, Osborne had obtained the Grimoire and the Compendium!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Alfreda watched Osborne with a mix of envy and admiration, her expression conflicted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Prince Chuck, you're being way too generous! When my father asked you for the Heavenly Compendium of All Beings, you wouldn't even part with the whole thing&mdash;just gave him the first volume. And now, you're handing over the complete compendium to Osborne? I'm feeling a bit jealous here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chuck chuckled, "At the time, I had only compiled the first volume of the Heavenly Compendium of All Beings, so naturally, I could only give that to the King of Nature Elf. But if you want it, I can transfer the entire compendium to you right now, Princess Alfreda."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That would be amazing!" Alfreda couldn't help but smile, a touch of pride in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon enough, Chuck copied the Compendium and sent it over to Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chuck announced, "Alright, it's time for us to head out!</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Before we entered Umbra Earth, I was pretty confident&mdash;thought I could take on anyone in the younger generation of Elf City, aside from a select few. I believed I could achieve great things here.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now that I'm here, I realize my strength is still lacking! I've learned that, in the wider world, there are people more talented than me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Chuck cast a meaningful glance at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Therefore, I've decided to leave Umbra Earth with my sister.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"While there are countless treasures here, you need the strength to claim them! I've reached my limit, and I intend to focus on improving my abilities once I return.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, Alfreda, I hope you both find even greater rewards! And may you return safely to Elf City! When you do, be sure to visit us at&mdash;we'll be sure to give you a warm welcome."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and Alfreda both nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely! If the chance arises, we'll definitely drop by!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go, Joanna!" Joanna said, giving a nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joanna shot a lingering glance at Osborne, biting her lip as she said, "Osborne, I'll be waiting for you in Elf City! You must come find us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, feeling a warmth in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Letitia chimed in, "Osborne, whenever you have the time, feel free to visit us at the Human Community Federation base in Elf City! If we're not there, we might be at the Human Community Federation from the Racial Convergence Planet... and you're always welcome to visit us there one day!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Count on it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, they bid farewell to Osborne before departing, their exploration of Umbra Earth now at an end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Osborne and Alfreda, their journey was far from over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, "Let's go! We need to find a safe spot. I want to study the Azure Ore first!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
