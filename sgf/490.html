  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, the Luther family dispatched two yachts in total.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they wanted to send more, they were afraid that sending too many yachts would startle Osborne and have an adverse effect on their decapitation strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Yaron and other leaders of the Luther family were standing aboard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The masters from the Walker, Marion and Hawthorne families restrained all their strength and hid in the cabin. Only after they got close to Osborne would they suddenly appear and attack him together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shawn, where are the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>?" Yaron asked Shawn in the cabin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn said calmly, "Don't worry, they are already prepared and are on their way. When the critical moment comes, they will also strike him. As long as Osborne stayed around the </span><span>location</span><span> he sent us, he would definitely not be able to escape."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yaron nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, we're almost there, let's see whether he's there or not first!" Shawn reminded Yaron.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yaron nodded, quickly took the telescope and looked at the sea in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, a yacht of the Augustine family appeared in his vision. Yaron even saw that Osborne and Clarissa were hugging each other and sitting at the bow of the yacht fishing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this situation, Yaron suddenly became excited. "There he is! I have seen him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Yaron saw Wallace, who was hanging in the air with a rope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snorted at this scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yaron said, "He actually came here to take the ransoms personally! How arrogant and callow he is! I can't believe he can still fish with his girlfriend like they are on a spring outing. It's a humiliation to the Luther family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it's better this way. After tonight, Osborne will be erased from this world forever! He is already a dead man to us! Don't talk, and hold back your strength. Don't let him find you, or he'll escape in advance, and it will be hard for us to stop him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We must wait to strike him until we are close enough to end his life within a second!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After commanding his subordinates, Yaron sped up his yacht.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two yachts of the Luther family quickly approached Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne had already spotted them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Satan's Eye showed him the yachts and metahumans hiding inside who restrained their power from being noticed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn, Emery, and Dexter were all there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were also many members from the four ancient families, all of whom were Class A-.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sneer appeared at the corner of Osborne's mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "They are here! Just as I expected, all the masters from the four ancient families have all come to hunt me! There are nearly sixty people in total, including fifteen Class A masters and more than forty Class A- masters! It's hilarious to see these masters squeezing against each other in the tiny cabins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's also hilarious for them to think they could sneak attack by hiding their trace and approaching me." After Osborne finished speaking, he ignored them and pretended not to notice any weirdness nearby, continuing to fish with Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Clarissa seemed a little nervous at this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Luther family formed a frightening army containing fifteen Class A masters and forty Class A- masters. She couldn't help feeling uneasy and worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she knew that Osborne was very mighty, she still doubted whether he could fight so many competitive men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Osborne, I'm a little nervous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Osborne quickly held her hand and said with a smile, "I told you not to come with me. Now you know why I did that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa bit her lip. "I'm just nervous, not scared! I said I would face all dangers with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, she found that her nervousness was eased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, the two yachts of the Luther family finally approached them, and Osborne finally stood up and looked at Yaron and others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said calmly, "Where is the ransom?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yaron's face turned cold when he heard this. "Osborne, you arrogant bastard. You even dared to kidnap the heir of the Luther family and blackmail us! Do you think that you have taken charge of </span><span>Dampston</span><span> now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly. "I'm not sure for now, but I know I will be the person in charge of </span><span>Dampston</span><span> from now on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yaron was stunned and frowned. "What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged. "It's simple, actually. The four ancient families in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, the Walker, Luther, Marion, and Hawthorne families will be destroyed today. When you all die, I will naturally control everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, an evil smile appeared at the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A chill struck Yaron's spine in an instant, and Yaron said in surprise, "What, what do you mean? You want to kill us? He must have discovered our plan! This is probably his scheme! Hurry up and kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, dozens of powerful power waves suddenly erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn, Emery, Dexter and other Class A masters appeared in an instant, quickly surrounded Osborne, and stared at him with cold expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you're dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn stared at Osborne coldly, "We don't need someone as egoist as you in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>. Keeping you alive will disturb the bigger picture here! And by the time you become much more powerful than all of us, we will have to kneel in front of you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you must die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
