  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sixth fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity felt like adding an extra layer of armor to Osborne's Divine Body, or perhaps it was akin to forging a second skeleton and flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While his Divine Body level didn't increase, its strength had surged tremendously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Osborne had accomplished all the training goals he had set for himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He reveled in the surge of power coursing through him, a satisfied smile spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was now at the mid-stage of Celestial Deity, with a Level Nine Divine Body, bolstered by the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. His space elemental essence had reached Level Seven, while both his dark and lightning elemental essences peaked at Level Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His Spatial Clone had also advanced to Level Four, allowing him to create up to eight clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Compared to just half a month ago, Osborne felt like a completely transformed warrior, with improvements across the board.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne murmured to himself, "Even a peak Deity Overlord warrior wouldn't stand much of a chance against me now! Below the Deity King level, there are probably very few who could match my strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As for Deity Kings... well, that's a different story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They're on a whole different level, and I'm not quite ready to take them on yet. But when it comes to survival skills, I'd wager I have the edge over most Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So now, even if I venture into Divine Peak Nine, I've got a decent shot at survival and maybe even snagging some treasures!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that thought, he turned his gaze to Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her progress had been remarkable as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His clone had been keeping a close watch on Diana throughout the past two weeks, waking her periodically to prevent her from falling into illusions while also ensuring her safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was well aware of her gains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By the fifth day, Diana had already broken through from the early Deity Overlord stage to the mid-stage. Just yesterday, she had surged again, reaching the late Deity Overlord stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In just half a month, she had advanced two small realms!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If anyone else heard of such rapid breakthroughs, they would likely be left speechless, thinking Diana had stumbled upon the Miracle Elixir of Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Osborne couldn't help but feel a twinge of shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, with his Infinite Devouring Eyes, he had only managed to achieve two small realm advancements in the same timeframe, despite his lower overall level compared to Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Logically, his breakthroughs were much easier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Over the past fifteen days, she's absorbed nearly all the energy from two thousand Ultimate Essence Crystals! It makes sense that she could elevate two small realms in the Deity Overlord stage with such a massive influx of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In contrast, my own breakthrough seems less normal. The energy my Infinite Devouring Eyes absorbed was definitely several times more than what Diana took in&mdash;equivalent to at least ten thousand Ultimate Essence Crystals. Yet, I only managed to advance two small realms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That means, at the Celestial Deity level, I require five times the energy for a breakthrough compared to Diana at the Deity Overlord level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps that's why I can easily defeat opponents above my level! Each time I advance, I need energy that's dozens, if not hundreds, of times greater than what ordinary warriors require. If that doesn't allow me to challenge higher levels, then what's the point of it all?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With those thoughts swirling in his mind, Osborne took a deep breath to steady himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Time's almost up; I should wake her now!" he decided, summoning Diana from her meditative state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As her eyes fluttered open, a spark of brilliance shone within them, and an overwhelming surge of power erupted forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is that... Level Six peak earth elemental essence?" Osborne murmured, astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In that fleeting moment, Osborne sensed the status of Diana's elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had reached the pinnacle of Level Six!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne recalled when he first met her; back then, her earth elemental essence was only at the early Level Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, she had soared to the peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It seems Diana has made strides beyond just her realm! Her elemental essence is advancing at lightning speed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Level Six peak&mdash;this is the limit for anyone below a Deity King! Truly a prodigy!" Osborne thought, a smile spreading across his face as he looked at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, the half-month mark has passed! We need to head back to the outpost immediately and get ready for our mission at Divine Peak Nine. If we don't hurry back, the higher-ups might think we've deserted our posts and send someone after us!" he said, urgency lacing his tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded vigorously, her expression filled with joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clearly, the intensive training over the past two weeks had exceeded her expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had reached the late Deity Overlord stage!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling a surge of confidence, she thought, "Even if I face a peak Deity Overlord now, I believe I can hold my ground and maybe even defeat them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This newfound strength filled her with an unshakeable self-assurance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at Osborne, gratitude radiated from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it weren't for him bringing her here, providing her with ample Ultimate Essence Crystals to use, and having his clone protect her while waking her periodically, she would never have achieved such remarkable growth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Diana realized how fortunate she had been since meeting Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just twenty days ago, she was merely at the late stage of Celestial Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, she stood at the late Deity Overlord stage, unafraid of even the peak Deity Overlords!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her life had changed dramatically because of Osborne.</span></p><div class="pagination">
