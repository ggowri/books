  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne stepped out of his lodgings, he hooked up with Bethan and Jamar, heading for the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today was the grand finale of the city duel&mdash;the day when the champion and the top ten contenders would finally be crowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they made their way, Osborne couldn't help but notice how deserted the streets around Azure Haven Academy were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like the whole town had stampeded to the arena, jostling for the best seats to catch the crowning of the city-</span><span>duel</span><span> champ.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!" A familiar voice rang out, and he whipped around to see Angela striding towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go on without me," he said, motioning for Bethan and Jamar to keep moving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he turned back to Angela, his curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela flashed him a warm smile. "It's the last day of the city duel, and you're one of only two undefeated guys left in the running. Honestly, you've blown all my </span><span>expectations out of the water. Since you've come this far, go out there and grab that championship!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you manage to clinch the victory, I've got a real treat in store for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A treat?" Osborne arched an eyebrow, hooked by her mysterious vibe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Angela just shot him a grin, leaving him scratching his head about what she had up her sleeve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll give it my all," Osborne said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She nodded, her expression turning </span><span>dead serious</span><span>. "Today's bouts are </span><span>gonna</span><span> be fierce. Azure Haven Academy has been pulling some shady moves with the match pairings. All your opponents are from there, and they'll surely try to wear you out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a confident chuckle. "No problem! When you have absolute strength, all their little tricks are just a joke!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela stopped for a second, caught </span><span>off guard</span><span> by his rock-solid confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, she nodded. "Okay then, as long as you're ready! I'll be in the stands, rooting for you, waiting to see you claim that title!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she waved goodbye and headed off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued on his way to the arena, but he suddenly felt a pair of eyes on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to see Clara emerging from the Fantasia Isle quarters, her gaze fixed on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!" she called out, quickening her pace to catch up. "Hey there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hi, Clara!" Osborne replied, matching her friendly tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He appreciated her politeness; after all, she was a formidable opponent, having mastered Sacred Power at such a young age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were both set to be in the top ten of the city </span><span>duel</span><span> and would soon compete together in the state duel in Zephyr State.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think you can clinch the championship today?" Clara asked, her eyes sparkling with curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment before responding, "You really think I have a shot at it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara said, her confidence unwavering, "Absolutely! You've already beaten me! Others might doubt you, but I know you have the best chance of winning. Of course, Leroy is also a tough contender. I can sense she's not to be underestimated. If I face her, I can't say for sure I'd win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, it's clear that the championship will be fought between you and Leroy! But I'm rooting for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback. "</span><span>Why's</span><span> that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara smiled, "No reason, really. I just don't like Leroy! Plus, when we get to the state duel, we'll be teammates. You've got to help me out and get me into the top ten!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, help you? Get you into the top ten? What do you mean? How can I help you in the arena?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara looked equally surprised. "You don't know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Know what?" Osborne asked, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara let out an exasperated sigh. "The state duel isn't just a bunch of one-on-one scraps! Seriously, don't you know? There are a hundred cities in Zephyr State, and </span><span>each city picks its top ten fighters for the state duel. That's a whopping thousand contestants in total!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are so many competitors that the usual arena showdowns just won't cut it. </span><span>So</span><span> starting from the state duel, we'll be switching to wilderness battles! Team-ups will be the norm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You didn't know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rubbed the back of his neck, looking a bit sheepish. He'd just assumed that the upcoming state and zone duels would follow the same arena-style format.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But wilderness battles? That was a whole new kettle of fish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you spell it out for me?" he asked, genuinely intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara nodded enthusiastically. "In the state duel, they usually pick a remote spot where all the thousand contestants go in to hunt for specific items. The more you snag, the higher your score! But just finding them </span><span>ain't</span><span> enough; you </span><span>gotta</span><span> be able to keep them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can swipe from each other, too! Even if you find a boatload of items, if you're not tough enough to defend them, it's all for nothing&mdash;you'll end up with </span><span>zero points</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The rankings in the state duel are based on how many points you rack up! So, a whole bunch of people team up to find and safeguard the items. If you try to go it alone, you're </span><span>gonna</span><span> have a hard time getting a good score!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, the competition in the state duel is cut-throat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll be up against opponents from First-rate Powers! If we don't team up, forget about cracking the top ten; it'll be a struggle just to make it into the top hundred."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne </span><span>listened,</span><span> his eyes wide in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that standing out in the state duel was going to be a whole lot tougher than in the city one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Tempest Fortress City, there were only three Second-rate Powers, and he could count the real threats on one hand. But in Zephyr State, there were a hundred cities, each with several Second-rate Powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every single one of those powers would be a force to be reckoned with, and many would be just as tough as the Mystic Sirius Sect. Just one strong contestant from each Second-rate Power could pile on the pressure for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then there were the disciples from First-rate Powers to worry about!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mere thought of going up against entire teams made his head spin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Going solo seemed like a near-impossible feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne asked Clara, "Are you thinking of teaming up with me for the state duel? Why not hook up with Leroy or Marreese?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara kept a poker face. "Like I said, I'm not into them! Besides, they wouldn't go for it anyway! The folks from Azure Haven Academy will stick together and won't even give us a second look."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, mulling over her words. "Alright! If push comes to shove, let's team up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara's face broke into a beaming smile. "It's a done deal! And I'm already crossing my fingers for you to take down Leroy and grab the city </span><span>duel</span><span> championship!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave, Clara took off, leaving Osborne to make his way to the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The place was charged with energy, filled with spectators champing at the bit for the final showdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the battles got underway, Osborne waited for his turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But first up were Marreese and Tyson. They went at it hammer and tongs for half an hour, and in the end, Marreese came out on top once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next up was Leroy versus Tyson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was obvious to all that Leroy was barely breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took out Tyson with ease, displaying a </span><span>might</span><span> that left the crowd in utter awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cheers for Leroy's likely victory reached a deafening crescendo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At last, Osborne heard the referee call his name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mystic Sirius Sect's Osborne, up against Azure Haven Academy's Leona Acosta!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sprang to his feet, his veins pumping with adrenaline. "It's finally my turn!"</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
