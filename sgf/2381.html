  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the auction, apart from Osborne, no one recognized the Death Vine seed. Therefore, he successfully won the seed for just twenty-eight thousand Sacred Crystals with hardly any effort.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Compared to the true value of the Death Vine, this price was incredibly cheap.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, in the eyes of those unaware, Osborne spending such a high price on an unknown seed that couldn't even be cultivated to sprout seemed utterly foolish.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Leroy and Clara were puzzled as to why Osborne would be interested in such a seed that couldn't sprout.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne simply smiled calmly and said, "I'm just quite interested in various plants and felt a connection with it, so I decided to buy it. Besides, since I'm here, I should take something back with me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy and Clara nodded and didn't ask further.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne wasted no time and went straight to the auction backstage to complete the transaction. Only after getting the Death Vine seed in hand </span><span>did</span><span> he feel at ease.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll nurture it slowly after I get back," he said, then returned to the auction hall.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, the auction was getting fiercer, and the value of the items kept rising. With Osborne's wealth, he no longer </span><span>even</span><span> had the qualification to bid.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He originally planned to leave, but Clara and Leroy wanted to keep watching, so Osborne had to stay.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The auctioneer said, "Item number 226!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is an extremely rare treasure! In the right hands, it will unleash immense power. This treasure is the Starry Eye of the Void Ray!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The auctioneer finished speaking and then displayed the item.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a peculiar eye, emitting a deep blue glow, incredibly profound. Even though it was just a single eye, it could still blink naturally.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the entire auction erupted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? That's actually the Starry Eye of the Void Ray! How did the Phantom Commerce Guild manage to get something like this? The Void Ray lives deep in the universe and is part of the Apex Clan. Its strength might not match the Sacred Dragon Clan or the Sacred Tiger Clan, but it's definitely a super powerful race!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And the Starry Eye is a treasure that only the top geniuses of the Void Ray clan have a chance to possess. It's said that the Starry Eye of the Void Ray can perceive the essence of the universe. Once fused with one's own eye, it not only greatly enhances vision but also allows sensing the location of treasures."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd's discussion surprised Osborne a bit. "Void Ray's Starry Eye? Its effect seems similar to Satan's Eye?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but think, "Even something like this is at the auction? If I could fuse this Void Ray's Starry Eye with my Satan's Eye, would my Satan's Eye become even stronger? Also, how does this Starry Eye compare to my Satan's Eye in strength?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't know the answer, so he sought advice from Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial pondered for a moment before replying, "The Void Ray's Starry Eye is indeed powerful. Especially this one, it definitely comes from a Supreme Empyrean Sacredness-level Void Ray. Its effect is probably not much weaker than your Satan's Eye."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Of course, it's just a dead object now. Even if someone fuses with it, they can only unleash a small part of its power, nowhere near comparable to your Satan's Eye."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's more, your Satan's Eye can still grow. In a comparison at the same level, your Satan's Eye is definitely stronger. If you </span><span>fuse</span><span> your Satan's Eye with this Starry Eye, it might further enhance your Satan's Eye, possibly even evolving it to the Mid Sacredness Level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne's eyes immediately lit up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fusing this Starry Eye could upgrade his Satan's Eye to Mid Sacredness Level?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stared at the Starry </span><span>Eye,</span><span> his heart filled with longing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the auctioneer's words brought a helpless expression to his face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This Void Ray's Starry Eye comes from a Void Ray at the Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection cultivation level! Our Phantom Commerce Guild obtained it after immense effort."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I believe everyone is well aware of its value, so I won't elaborate further. Now, let's begin the auction for this Starry Eye."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Starting bid, three million Sacred Crystals."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne shook his head upon hearing the starting bid of three million Sacred Crystals, knowing he couldn't obtain this Starry Eye. He currently had only a little over a hundred thousand Sacred Crystals, and the price of three million completely dashed his hopes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, three million Sacred Crystals was just the starting bid.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, as the auctioneer's words fell, the auction instantly turned into a fierce competition. People in the VIP boxes began placing bids frantically.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Four million Sacred Crystals!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Five million Sacred Crystals!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I bid six million Sacred Crystals!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Seven million Sacred Crystals!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Eight million Sacred Crystals!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quickly, the price of this Void Ray's Starry Eye soared to ten million Sacred Crystals, with no sign of the bidding stopping.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such a scene left Osborne in awe, while Leroy and Clara were dumbfounded, their eyes full of envy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy said, "For us zone </span><span>duel</span><span> participants, the Starry Eye is incredibly valuable. After all, this zone duel is essentially a Treasure Hunt. With this Starry Eye, not only does vision improve significantly, but it also senses the location of treasures, giving an absolute advantage in the hunt!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If we can get this Starry Eye, we'll have a chance to make it into the top ten of the zone </span><span>duel</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara agreed, "Unfortunately, the price is just too high!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At this price, I'm afraid even an average Second-rate Power couldn't afford it, even with their entire fortune. Those competing now must all be from First-rate Powers."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded after hearing that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He possessed Satan's Eye and knew very well how important vision was during treasure hunting. And this Starry Eye came from the eye of a Void Ray at the Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection cultivation level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Empyrean Sacredness is divided into primary, mid, advanced, highest, and Perfection stages.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among them, Empyrean Sacredness Perfection is further divided into Lesser Perfection and Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection is hailed as Supreme Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, it is even more awe-inspiring. On the entire Racial Convergence Planet, warriors at this level are extremely rare, and each one is a prominent figure commanding great respect, such as Adriana.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, the eye of an Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection Void Ray is incredibly powerful for treasure hunting. If this Starry Eye ends up in the hands of a zone </span><span>duel</span><span> participant, even Osborne would need to stay vigilant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Eighteen million Sacred Crystals!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Twenty million Sacred Crystals!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, the auction for the Starry Eye came to an end. The person in VIP Box No. 3 successfully won the Starry Eye for twenty million Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, the entire venue buzzed with chatter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Twenty million Sacred Crystals! That price could totally buy an ordinary top-grade Sacred Artifact, right? This Starry Eye is powerful, but is it really worth twenty million Sacred Crystals?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You just don't get it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The person in VIP Box No. 3 is from the first-rate power Rose Rebels. Valentino from Rose Rebels is the top favorite to win this zone duel!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Rose Rebels bought this Starry Eye, clearly intending it for Valentino. He was already a top favorite to win, and now with the Starry Eye, his chances of taking the championship are even higher!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's twenty million Sacred Crystals?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The zone </span><span>duel</span><span> champion gets a reward of 100 million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span>. 100 million Kingdom Duel </span><span>Scorepoints</span><span> can at least be exchanged for 100 million Sacred Crystals."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If Valentino can win the championship with the Starry Eye, this deal would be an absolute jackpot!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
