  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group gazed at Osborne and his clones with a mix of admiration and curiosity, speculating about their true identities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo, however, couldn't shake off a feeling of unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "When has spatial power, that legendary ability, become so commonplace? For centuries, I haven't heard of anyone mastering it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now eight individuals have appeared, all with identical strengths."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the fierce battle against the Deathborn army, he hadn't had the time to ponder these thoughts, but now it struck him as odd. "Even the esteemed Lord Malevolence can't possibly summon eight young talents from Paramount Supreme Clan, all sharing the same age and abilities, could he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo frowned and fell into deep contemplation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Osborne approached, flanked by his eight clones, positioning themselves in a way that subtly encircled Angelo and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Bowman, thank you for saving us," Edison said, and his voice dripped with gratitude as he smiled broadly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others chimed in with their thanks, relief evident in their expressions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Athena, despite her disheveled appearance, managed to muster a smile as she expressed her appreciation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne observed their reactions, a smirk appearing on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to thank me? No need to rush! After all, you haven't quite made it through the danger yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confusion washed over the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had defeated Deathborn King and his army. And what danger could possibly remain?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo furrowed his brow. "Mr. Bowman, are you suggesting there's still a threat nearby?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, and his eyes glinted with mischief. "For you, yes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because... I'm your greatest danger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group fell silent, stunned by his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean?" one of them asked, bewildered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned serious. "Will you surrender willingly, or should I make it a bit more painful for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gasps filled the air as disbelief swept over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo's body tensed, and his voice was steady but cautious. "Mr. Bowman, I don't quite understand. You're a genius from Paramount Supreme Clan, a relative of the esteemed Lord Malevolence. We're all loyal soldiers of the esteemed Lord Malevolence. We're not enemies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's smile widened. "Is that so? But have you considered that I might not be from Paramount Supreme Clan at all? I'm... just part of Human Community."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The revelation hit them like a bolt from the blue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo stared in disbelief. "You... you're not from Paramount Supreme Clan? You're part of Human Community?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, and his features shifted as he transformed into the likeness of Lachlan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Athena gasped, and her eyes widened with horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you're Osborne? How is this possible? Were you supposed to be dead with Diana?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her shock was palpable. A mix of fear and disbelief was etched across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's cold gaze locked onto hers. "Athena, are you disappointed? Did you send me on a mission to explore Divine Peak Nine, hoping I'd meet my end there?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry to burst your bubble. Not only did I survive, but I also claimed the Miracle Elixir you discovered first, boosting my power immensely. And now, it's your turn to face death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that chilling declaration, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of terrifying power erupted from him, and in an instant, Athena found herself lifted off the ground, his grip tightening around her throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo didn't intervene. He could feel the watchful eyes of Osborne's clones trained on him, ready to pounce at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo glared at Osborne, fury radiating from him. "Are you really just a pathetic member of Human Community? You deceived me! Where did you get the Supreme Malevolence Sword?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled nonchalantly. "Oh, I acquired it after taking down a genuine genius from the Paramount Supreme Clan. His name was Tobey, if I remember right. He was accompanied by a couple of talents from Demonic Dragon Clan&mdash;one named Myron and the other Sara?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, Angelo's face turned crimson, rage overtaking him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you're the one who killed my son Myron, my daughter Sara, and Tobey! It was you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo glared at Osborne, and his fists clenched tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's smile widened. "What a coincidence! Were they your children? But I'm afraid their bodies have been crushed to dust. You should really worry about yourself now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm only interested in killing Athena. Because there's just something about her that makes my skin crawl."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, Osborne tightened his grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Athena's neck broke with a sickening sound, and her eyes widened with fear and despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regret flooded her mind as she realized that her obsession with Calvin had led her to provoke Osborne, but it was far too late for apologies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Life slipped away from her, plunging her into eternal darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne tossed her lifeless body aside as if discarding a rag doll. He turned toward the remaining group with a gleam of amusement in his eyes. "As for the rest of you, if you're willing to submit to me, I can guarantee your survival. If not, you'll meet the same fate as Athena."</span></p><div class="pagination">
