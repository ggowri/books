  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Her condition hasn't improved. Waking up just now was an accident," Isa said after examining Anastasia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face fell with disappointment. Against reason, he had hoped that Anastasia's sudden awakening might be a sign of recovery, though he knew deep down it was only because of Zoe's presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa studied Zoe carefully before speaking again. "There can be a special connection between twin sisters, and it was this connection that temporarily woke Anastasia. Unfortunately, it didn't help her illness. In fact, it worsened it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Osborne's face turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe felt guilty. She asked, "Ms. Bowin. Anastasia will be okay, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa shook her head and pointed at Osborne. "That depends on his abilities. Initially, she could have lived for another year. Now, it's down to eight months."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne clenched his fists tightly, the gravity of the situation sinking in. "Eight months! She has only eight months left!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't blame Zoe and said with determination, "I'll expedite my access to higher resources and get her into the Godfather's medical research lab. No matter what, I will save her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded with a smile. "Don't be so serious. There's still eight months, right? Shouldn't you be starting your new test? What is it? Considering you provided me with a test subject, I might help you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne awkwardly rubbed his nose. The new test required him to pursue Clarissa, and he couldn't bring himself to tell Isa about it. Besides, how could she help him in matters of the heart? He still remembered the last time he had forcibly kissed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe next time," he replied evasively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa didn't press further. She shrugged. "Suit yourself. Rarely does this witch offer free help, and you don't appreciate it. Fine, I wasn't keen on charity work anyway."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then turned her attention to Zoe. "I need to draw some blood from you. While it's almost certain that you and Anastasia are sisters, it's best to confirm it. Plus, my tests are special. I can check if you have any power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up. "You can test if she got power? Zoe mentioned she might have some, but I think it's probably not what we typically consider."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh?" Isa's curiosity was piqued. "Zoe, tell me more. Why do you think you have powers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe hesitated but then began to explain in detail. When she finished, Osborne commented, "I think this just means Zoe is good at singing. It doesn't sound like a power to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa rolled her eyes. "Don't talk if you don't know what you're saying! This could very well be a psychic power. Many psychic metahumans can utilize their voices to exert power. What Zoe described sounds a lot like a manifestation of it. But we can find out for sure. Zoe, sing us a song. I'll be able to sense it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe looked at Osborne, who nodded. "Just do as she said. She knows more about this than I do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright." Zoe nodded. She took a deep breath and began to sing. Her voice was enchanting, clear, and pure, with bright high notes, rich low notes, and ethereal middle tones. It was beyond beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, Osborne simply found her voice lovely. But soon, he felt something was off. His consciousness seemed to be sinking into a bottomless abyss, separating from his body, which stood motionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the Blood Cross tattoo on his chest activated, releasing a cold energy that snapped him out of the trance. Osborne was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next to him, Isa wore an enraptured expression, her body still and unresponsive. She abruptly shuddered and woke up, her face filled with astonishment as she looked at Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?" Isa exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Startled, Zoe quickly stopped singing and looked at Isa with fear and uncertainty. "Ms. Bowin, is there something wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa didn't say anything. She grabbed Zoe's arm, examining her closely as if she were a precious gem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zoe, do you want to become a master? I can teach you! From now on, I'll be your mentor and train you to become the best!" Isa said excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe was stunned. She was clearly tempted, but she looked to Osborne for guidance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned. "Isa, what's going on? Is Zoe's power so strong that you want to take her as your disciple?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa took a deep breath. "Her talent is beyond strong. It's extraordinary! She definitely has power, a psychic one. Her power is scarce. It's one in a million. It's a divine power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback. "What is a divine power?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
