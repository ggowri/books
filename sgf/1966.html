  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what did you do to that Lotus? It's willingly offering its essence for the final fusion with you! How did you manage to pull that off?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't respond right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind was racing; he could sense that the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity's resistance was waning. He knew that, sooner or later, they would achieve a complete fusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to think that this final step was initiated by the Lotus itself was beyond his expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned, asking, "Is there something wrong with that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial replied, astonished, "What could possibly be wrong?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's willingly giving up its essence to merge with you! This is a huge advantage for you! Think of it this way: merging with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity is like a romantic encounter. If you force someone into bed, that's essentially assault! You'll face fierce resistance, and even if you succeed, they'll come back to haunt you with endless trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if they're eager to join you, it's a whole different story&mdash;you get more than just their body; you gain their heart and affection!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, which scenario do you think works out better for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but roll his eyes. "Primordial, where did you learn all this? You're just a tree! How do you even know what 'getting in bed' means? You've picked up some bad habits!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, I'm just using a metaphor! As for how I know all this, I picked it up from your memories," Primordial replied, grinning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression hardened abruptly. "You can peek into my memories?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned, contemplating whether he should lock Primordial away outside the Soul Current Ocean for a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial, sensing the shift, quickly reassured him, "Don't worry! I can only catch glimpses of trivial memories. After all, I've merged with your Soul Current Ocean, so it's only natural!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!" Osborne snorted. "From now on, no more peeking into my memories! If I catch you snooping, I'll kick you out of my Soul Current Ocean!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial rolled its eyes. "Got it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chose to ignore Primordial for the moment, focusing instead on the final fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. Since the Lotus had taken the initiative, the process was remarkably smooth&mdash;he didn't feel any pain at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This left Osborne feeling a bit exasperated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, every time he had merged with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, it had been a painful ordeal. He had thought that was just part of the process, something he had to endure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now it seemed that the previous agony was likely the Lotus' silent resistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Indeed, you can't force things. Communication is key!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured to himself, feeling the fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity reach its climax. At that moment, the Lotus transformed into countless fine particles, completely merging with his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne felt as if he had become a massive crimson lotus flower, blooming with newfound power and vitality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne felt a profound change coursing through his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He transformed into a massive, blood-red lotus, standing proudly in the void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His roots sank deep into the emptiness, drawing in energy from the surrounding space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the realization hit him that he had become a blood lotus, he was utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's laughter echoed in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne! You were just mocking me for being a tree, and now look at you! You've turned into a lotus, and it's not even as cool as my tree form!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne fought the urge to punch Primordial. "Primordial, what's going on here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really don't know? It seems your fusion isn't fully complete yet! This is your second form! The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity has given its essence to you, allowing for the deepest fusion possible. Naturally, you've unlocked your second form! And that form is this lotus!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne blinked, taken aback. "Second form? What's the point of this transformation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial sighed in exasperation, "Your second form lets you fully utilize the abilities of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity! Normally, even if you merged completely, you'd only access part of its power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now, with this second form, you can wield all of its capabilities! As for what those abilities are, I'm not sure. Once you fully integrate, you'll find out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Primordial finished speaking, Osborne felt a tremendous surge in his mind, followed by a chaotic influx of information. It felt like a torrent of disjointed memories, but he instinctively knew they were the essence of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Closing his eyes, he focused intently to comprehend it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, I see!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, he opened his eyes, his expression brimming with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, hurry up and tell me! What abilities does the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity have?" Primordial urged, its voice tinged with impatience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smile crept onto Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity has five abilities!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First up is absolute defense!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I take on this second form, I'll have an impenetrable defense! In this state, I can't move or attack, but I'll be completely invulnerable! Even if this entire cosmos exploded, my absolute defense wouldn't budge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial was taken aback, exclaiming enviously, "What? Absolute defense?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's a bit over the top, don't you think? Even the World Tree doesn't have an absolute defense&mdash;what makes this lotus so special?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a rush of pride. This ability amazed him; it meant that as long as he transformed into the second form&mdash;the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity&mdash;he'd be nearly untouchable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one would be able to kill him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, reality set in. He realized that maintaining this form required a significant amount of energy and soul power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his current strength, he could only sustain it for about an hour before needing to revert to his first form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An hour of absolute defense and invincibility isn't too shabby! Too bad I can't move, though. If I could, with my spatial power, who could touch me? Even a warrior from the Order of the Celestial Way would just be left staring!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head, lost in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! Don't zone out on me! What are the other four abilities?" Primordial pressed, eager for more details.</span></p><div class="pagination">
