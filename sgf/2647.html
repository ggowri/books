  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina was still desperately explaining and pleading in fear, but Frederick suddenly struck, killing her with a single blow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The scene left everyone stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina is Frederick's biological daughter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Simply because she failed to retrieve the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket from the Celestial Spire, Frederick took her life without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't even give Seraphina a chance to explain herself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though everyone believed that failing to obtain the key was not Seraphina's fault, she had done her utmost and achieved all she could within her abilities; the blame should never have fallen on her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Frederick still mercilessly killed her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, countless people were shocked and terrified.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Especially the princes and princesses of the Royal Family, whose eyes flickered intensely, their bodies cold, wishing they could vanish on the spot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina was no ordinary prince or princess.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her talent was considered top-notch in the entire Royal Family, and under Frederick's guidance, her strength at the same level far surpassed Weston, Quinn, and Naomi.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina had already fused four types of powers before breaking through to Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was a speed unmatched within the Royal Family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It could be said that if Seraphina's talent were second, no one would dare claim first. She was fully qualified to compete for the title of "Number One Genius" on the Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as she lived, with her displayed strength and talent, she was bound to become the backbone of the Royal Family, making the entire family stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A genius like Seraphina would be treasured and protected like a gem in any major power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Frederick mercilessly took her life simply because she failed to obtain the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Frederick's ruthlessness terrified everyone, including other Royal Family members.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their talent was far inferior to Seraphina's, and their importance in Frederick's eyes was much less than hers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If anyone dared to say a word at this moment, they would likely be the next person Frederick killed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, all the Royal Family members remained silent. Even Seraphina's own brother, Hendrix, merely clenched his fists, his eyes filled with pain, but he dared not speak or utter a single sound of grief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He lowered his head, as if he hadn't seen his sister's tragic death right before him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Useless! Useless!" Frederick muttered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After killing Seraphina, his anger still hadn't subsided.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He grabbed Seraphina's Dimensional Bag with a wave of his hand, forcefully broke it open, and quickly searched through its contents.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clearly, he still didn't believe Seraphina's words and was determined to find the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket in her Dimensional Bag.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he found nothing. This made Frederick even angrier.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He unleashed his power, and Seraphina's Dimensional Bag instantly collapsed, began imploding, and ultimately vanished into the void.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A terrifying killing intent emanated from Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He slowly turned around, his eyes blood-red, exuding murderous intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His gaze locked onto Emiliano, Matthew, and the other three, as they had once entered the Celestial Spire with Seraphina.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Useless!" Frederick muttered under his breath.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stared at them coldly, suddenly reaching out as a terrifying force surged forth. Emiliano, Matthew, Rosalie, Yunus, and Jasmine were instantly pulled in front of Frederick, their throats gripped by a hand formed from his power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the five's eyes were filled with fear and pleading.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Father! This has nothing to do with us!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We were eliminated before passing the eighteenth level, we really haven't seen the key to the Eighth Skyfall Casket!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Spare us, Father!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Father..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, they could clearly feel the icy killing intent emanating from Frederick, and everyone was trembling violently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They desperately turned to look at the other members of the Royal Family, hoping they could persuade Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, at this moment, the Royal Family members didn&rsquo;t dare to speak, all lowering their heads and pretending not to see.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Callista turned her head away, not daring to speak while Frederick was angry.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Useless!" Frederick said coldly, "Since you failed to get the key to The Eighth Skyfall Casket, what use do I have for keeping you around? You're just wasting my resources!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What&rsquo;s the point of you being alive?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You all deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've been preparing for so long, and success was within reach, but you useless fools ruined the plan. Without the key to the Skyfall Casket, it can't be opened. There's no reason to spare your lives anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You all must die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The murderous intent around Frederick grew increasingly terrifying. He seemed to have entered a state of madness. The pleas and explanations from Emiliano, Matthew, and the other three fell completely on deaf ears; all he wanted now was to kill to vent his anger."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Crack!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Crack crack!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The next second, his powerful hand suddenly exerted force, snapping the necks of the five people directly. But this was clearly not enough to quell Frederick's rage."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He struck out with another palm, unleashing terrifying power in an instant."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Boom!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The five bodies exploded in mid-air, instantly turning to dust."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This scene made the surroundings even quieter, as if the air had frozen."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, Frederick's actions did not stop. His scarlet and terrifying gaze suddenly fixed on Osborne, Clara, and everyone who had ventured into Celestial Spire."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At this moment, everyone felt a chill run through their entire body."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The madness in Frederick's eyes filled them with extreme fear, leaving most unable to stand, collapsing directly to the ground."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne's expression suddenly changed."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He thought, 'Frederick, he's going to kill them to vent his anger!'"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sure enough, the next second Frederick made his move. 'You useless fools! I brought you here, sent you into Celestial Spire. Yet you couldn't even bring back the key to the Skyfall Casket. What use are you to me?'"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Useless fools deserve to die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Useless fools shouldn't exist in this world wasting resources!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone was in extreme terror.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They knew clearly that Frederick had completely lost his mind. He was determined to vent his anger on everyone who had entered Celestial Spire and kill them all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A terrifying power erupted, lifting those who had once ventured into Celestial Spire one by one and swiftly pulling them toward Frederick, including Mason, Brenda, and others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara, Leroy, and Casey were uncontrollably dragged closer to Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone's eyes were filled with despair and fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They knew their fate would be the same as Seraphina, Emiliano, and the others. They would be mercilessly struck to death by Frederick.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They began to panic and plead loudly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Help!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Help me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Emperor Frederick, please don't kill us!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Save us!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
