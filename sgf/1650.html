  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Algernon was riding high on his newfound confidence, waving his arms grandly as he led the group deeper into Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Along the way, he shared his experiences, clearly relishing the attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The more he talked, the more the others admired him, solidifying their resolve to follow his lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He beamed at them, saying, "Just stick with me! I can't promise I'll bring you all back in one piece&mdash;after all, you know how treacherous Divine Peak Nine is, with a casualty rate hitting ninety percent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But at least being with me gives you the best shot at survival!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne watched Algernon with a bemused expression, shaking his head slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While Algernon's insights seemed valuable, Osborne knew all too well that relying solely on experience wouldn't guarantee survival in this perilous place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For instance, the five Deathborn still trailed them from a distance, and Algernon was blissfully unaware.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne hesitated, weighing whether to warn Algernon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't know how many reinforcements the Deathborn might summon, and if it turned out to be a lot, it could spell trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The loss of these explorers wouldn't bother him, but he was concerned about his own safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, he spoke up, "Mr. Algernon Marley, I have a bad feeling about this. I think something's following us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Algernon stopped in his tracks, looking back at Osborne with a puzzled expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You think something's tailing us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded firmly. "Absolutely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My instincts have always been spot on. I suggest we check it out! If there are Deathborns behind us, they'll have left some traces, and it won't take long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Algernon frowned at the suggestion. "So, what you're saying is, you haven't actually seen anything unusual, but you just have a gut feeling?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You want us to stop and turn back because of a hunch?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He scoffed, shaking his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you really think that makes sense? You must be new to Divine Peak Nine&mdash;too nervous and scared! After all, the lowly human tends to be quite timid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words sparked laughter among the exploration team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ha! Mr. Algernon Marley is right; the Human Community is just a bunch of cowards! Look at him at the back, probably scared and hoping we'll check for danger behind him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What a waste of time! Let's ignore him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If there are Deathborns back there, they'll attack him first anyway. What do we care?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Exactly! Just let it go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression darkened at their mocking. He had tried to give them a heads-up, and instead of gratitude, they were insulting him&mdash;and the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He huffed, his voice cold, "If you don't believe me, that's your choice! Just don't come crying to me later when you regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Algernon sneered. "Are you threatening us? We're doing you a favor by letting you tag along, and instead of gratitude, you're trying to intimidate me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You really don't know when to quit! I'll let this slide this time but don't push your luck next time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And remember, I'm the captain of this exploration team. Everyone here follows my orders, and I say we keep moving forward without looking back! Keep your mouth shut!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a dismissive wave, he turned to the group. "Let's keep going!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The team continued forward, casting amused glances at Osborne and Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's face was a mask of frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, don't let it get to you..." Diana said, concern etched on her face as she looked at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne flashed a slight smirk. "Don't worry; I'm not upset! I have no desire to get mad at a bunch of dead men walking! If they're intent on finding trouble and refusing to heed my warnings, that's on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's move on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Osborne and Diana fell back, trailing at the end of the exploration team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they walked, he gradually distanced themselves from the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Initially, they were about a hundred yards behind, but as time went on, that gap widened to three hundred yards, then five hundred yards. In the thickening fog, they could barely make out the faint shapes of the team ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Algernon noticed their lagging distance but seemed unconcerned. In fact, he was urging everyone to pick up the pace, almost as if he wanted to shake off Osborne and Diana completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A cold smile crept onto Osborne's face. He activated the Eclipsing Mantra, cloaking both himself and Diana's energy signatures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Glancing back at the five Deathborn still shadowing them, he focused on the map in his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, the closest location from here is a town-level Deathborn nest! That means this squad of Deathborn is likely a patrol from that very nest. Given the distance, the one who went for reinforcements should be arriving soon..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just then, Osborne's eyes lit up as he peered into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hundreds of Deathborn were rapidly approaching, their forms like shadows against the mist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They're coming!" he exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without hesitation, he grabbed Diana's hand and pulled her behind a large tree. Thanks to the Eclipsing Mantra, they were able to remain undetected, not giving away a single trace of their energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moments later, a horde of Deathborn swept past them, moving silently toward the exploration team ahead.</span></p><div class="pagination">
