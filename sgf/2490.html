  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The person in charge of the Cosmic Translocator muttered, "Are you planning to use the Cosmic Translocator to go to Stellar Region M72?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That place doesn't have many intelligent beings, just a bunch of Stellar Exploration Organization members, Space Pirates, and some low-intelligence bugs that attack on sight. Why are so many people going there lately?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If I activate the Cosmic Translocator just for you to head to Stellar Region M72, you'll need to hand over 100,000 Sacred Crystals."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing these words, Osborne raised an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He first took out 100,000 Sacred Crystals and handed them over, then asked, "Hello, have many people been heading to Stellar Region M72 recently?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The person smiled but didn't answer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After thinking for a moment, Osborne took out another 10,000 Sacred Crystals and forcibly handed them over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, the person's attitude improved greatly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly put away the Sacred Crystals and whispered, "I&rsquo;m in charge of this Cosmic Translocator. In the past, I wouldn&rsquo;t encounter even a few people heading to Stellar Region M72 in a year. But in the past six months, at least dozens of groups have requested to activate the Cosmic Translocator to go to Stellar Region M72. And this is just the number of people from my Cosmic Translocator."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The entire Glorious Divine Kingdom has at least dozens of Cosmic Translocators leading to Stellar Region M72. If every Cosmic Translocator is experiencing the same situation, then many people are heading to Stellar Region M72. Moreover, Evernight Court has even more Cosmic Translocators."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Osborne was very surprised and quickly exchanged a glance with Angela.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela shook her head and said to him through Telepathy, "There&rsquo;s definitely something wrong. But I don&rsquo;t know exactly what it is. Maybe something happened in Stellar Region M72. However, Fairy Moon Sect doesn&rsquo;t pay much attention to that place, so we haven&rsquo;t received any news about it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and said, "In that case, let&rsquo;s head over first. Our target is just the Frenetic Storm Warband. We don&rsquo;t need to get involved in anything else."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela also nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the three of them stood on the Cosmic Translocator. After receiving Osborne's Sacred Crystal, the person quickly activated the Cosmic Translocator for Osborne and adjusted the coordinates.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The person smiled and said, "I&rsquo;m ready to activate the Cosmic Translocator."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's quite far from here to Stellar Region M72. Since you haven&rsquo;t reached Empyrean Sacredness yet, you might feel a bit uncomfortable. But just bear with it. Oh, by the way, I can give you a piece of information for free."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This Cosmic Translocator can only transport you to an abandoned resource-bearing planet on the edge of Stellar Region M72. If you want to reach Inferno Planet in the core area of Stellar Region M72, you&rsquo;ll need to head to another resource-bearing planet first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, the Cosmic Translocator was fully activated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne, Angela, and Agatha's figures instantly vanished from Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Osborne felt a wave of dizziness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Luckily, he could handle it. Soon, he calmed down and quietly waited for the teleportation to finish.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Stellar Region M72 is far from Racial Convergence Planet and closer to the edge of the cosmos than Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a long while, Osborne finally felt his feet touch the ground.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly activated Satan's Eye and looked around. Immediately, he realized they had arrived on an incredibly desolate and quiet planet. Here, they could hardly see any stars overhead; everything was dim, much like the situation on Abyssal Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But this place was closer to the edge of the cosmos than Abyssal Planet. Osborne could feel a gentle breeze brushing against his body, leaving him tingling as if electrified.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is Cosmic Wind," Angela said. "The presence of Cosmic Wind here proves that we've reached the edge of the cosmos. Moreover, the closer to the edge, the stronger the Cosmic Wind, to the point where even warriors at or above the Imperial Empyrean Sacredness level cannot approach."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, some say the cosmos is actually a massive cage. The raging Cosmic Wind at the edge of the cosmos is what prevents us from leaving, like the electric fences around cattle or sheep pens."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While explaining to Osborne, Angela gently released Sacred Power to block the Cosmic Wind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Agatha was doing the same.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded, thinking, "The cosmos is a cage? Cosmic Wind is like an electric fence stopping us from leaving the cosmos? This idea is quite novel."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a slight smile, Osborne didn't pay much attention to this idea, as the cosmos was simply too vast, with too many secrets and things he didn't know.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whether Angela's words were true or not, it had nothing to do with him at the moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So what if the cosmos is a cage?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this massive cage, Osborne could only move near the edges of the cosmos for now, without even the strength to enter the middle regions, let alone the core area.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had no thoughts of leaving the cosmos or escaping this cage at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Perhaps this is something the Sovereign Masters in the center of the cosmos should ponder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne just wanted to quickly find the Frenetic Storm Warband and rescue his parents.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There shouldn't be anything on this abandoned resource-bearing planet. Let's not waste time and head straight to the next resource-bearing planet with a Cosmic Translocator," Osborne said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Cosmic Translocator here only allowed them to teleport between this place and the Racial Convergence Planet's Cosmic Translocator; it couldn't send them deeper into Stellar Region M72. Fortunately, the Fairy Moon Sect had a rough star map of Stellar Region M72 and knew where the next resource-bearing planet with a translocator was located.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We'll set off from here and head to the next resource-bearing planet." Saying this, Angela pointed in an upward direction and took out a warship, which was a Mid-grade Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Angela's strength, owning a Mid-grade Sacred Artifact-level warship was already quite impressive. After all, warships are comprehensive Sacred Artifacts, valued higher than ordinary Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A Mid-grade Sacred Artifact-level warship is as valuable as a Superior Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela said, "With the speed of my warship, we can reach the next resource-bearing planet in three days."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, Osborne hesitated, pondering whether to take out the Ascending Sacred Sanctum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Ascending Sacred Sanctum is a Supreme Sacred Artifact. Even though it's severely damaged, its speed is much faster than a Mid-grade Sacred Artifact-level warship. If a Mid-grade Sacred Artifact-level warship takes three days to reach the next resource-bearing planet, the Ascending Sacred Sanctum would only take half a day.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne didn&rsquo;t do that, thinking, &ldquo;This is Stellar Region M72. I can&rsquo;t act too high-profile. If someone recognizes the Ascending Sacred Sanctum as a Supreme Sacred Artifact, I&rsquo;ll be in trouble. Besides, I need to keep some tricks up my sleeve. Anyway, it&rsquo;s just three days.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, the three of them boarded Angela's warship. Immediately, the warship set off, quickly leaving the desolate resource-bearing planet, entering the dark cosmos, and heading toward another distant resource-bearing planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, what they didn&rsquo;t notice was that on the other side of the resource-bearing planet, a small warship suddenly appeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A black skull emblem was hanging on that warship.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A person in a black robe faced a mirror, a Sacred Artifact, and said, "Boss, we have new prey."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They were teleported from Racial Convergence Planet. There are three of them, one man and two women. Among them, the strongest should be at mid Empyrean Sacredness, definitely not exceeding advanced Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They actually have a mid-grade Sacred Artifact-level warship. We're going to strike it rich this time. They're heading your way. Get ready to ambush them."</span></p><div class="pagination">
