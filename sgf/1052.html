  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo stepped into the cave, but it&rsquo;s empty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia, witnessing this, was struck again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was gone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just minutes earlier, she had brought Osborne here, hiding him while he was still unconscious, unsure when he might wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Osborne was gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's face darkened as he spoke, "He was definitely here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can still smell the scent of heart blood in the air. But the trail ends here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Some extreme powerful person masked his presence and was likely to have taken him away to some distant place! Who the hell could it be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's heart skipped a beat. No wonder Gerardo could locate this hidden cave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of dread washed over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Osborne had been taken away. Or he'd be taken back by Gerardo again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia felt a sudden gratitude for the mysterious person lurking in the shadows; without him/her, she couldn't have saved Osborne alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking Osborne must be in a safe place, she sighed in relief but dared not show it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Aniston, who exactly are you searching for? Just some Human Slaves, right? They come and go. We can always catch more. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was there someone really special among them? Do you want me to get him back? I've leveled up a lot recently and could use the practice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo frowned again at her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need. You're no match for him. Drop it and focus on your training. Break through to Class S first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his fury, Gerardo didn't reveal to Ophelia his plans to turn Osborne into a Human Slave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Osborne might be beyond retrieval now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though angry, he had no choice, and Ophelia, even more crucial, couldn't be lost as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go back," Gerardo said, leading Ophelia back to their base and instructing her to return to her training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo sat on his throne, deep in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Who could have silently infiltrated my base and took away hundreds of Human Slaves? Only the top-tier Class S warriors! Or even those in the top ten of Global Quasi-Divine Rankings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who among them is my enemy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, one of his subordinates rushed in, breathlessly saying, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your Majesty! Everett of the League of Divine Descent and Sin of the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization are here at the Room No.2. They need to discuss something important with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pondered, "Everett of the League of Divine Descent? Sin of the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization? Here nearby? Damn it, could they be behind this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett and Sin, despite their prowess as cream of top-tier Class S, couldn't have </span><span>breached my Room No.1 undetected and took away hundreds of Human Slaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But within the League of Divine Descent and the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, there are those who could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helios Thornberry, the number one force of the League of Divine Descent. Reginald Hastings, a close second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Emperor Dare, </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization's top assassin&mdash;any of them could have pulled it off!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it one of these who infiltrated my Room No.1, whisking away the Human Slaves and Osborne without a trace?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damn them, foiling my plans!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'll see the League of Divine Descent and the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization ruined for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo&rsquo;s anger welled up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All three ranked among the top ten in the Global Quasi-Divine Rankings, the only ones who could steal his slaves secretly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He growled, "Just wait! Messing with me will come back to bite you. You'll pay the price soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still fuming, Gerardo rose to his feet, ready to head to the Room No.2 to meet Everett and Sin, curious as to what they wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Room No.2 served as a guest quarter, kept separate from the more sensitive Room No.1 where divine corpses, Human Slaves, and clones were housed&mdash;secrets not to be exposed lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo mused, "Too bad Osborne knows everything about here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he talks, it could be troublesome. But I'm nearly ready. Even if he blabs, I can handle it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once I destroy the Augustine family and recapture Osborne, even if these secrets leak, it doesn&rsquo;t matter!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Gerardo tore open a dimensional rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he reappeared 300 miles away at Room No.2.</span></p><div class="pagination">
