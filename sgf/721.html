  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just hold me like this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma pouted, her cheeks flushed as she wriggled slightly in his grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So this is what it feels like to be held by a man," Emma murmured softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled awkwardly, realizing that he had resorted to this hold to keep her in check. Hearing her words, he relaxed his grip a bit, at least not holding her as tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma felt the change in his hold and couldn't help but scoff. "If you don't hold me tighter, I swear I'll just walk away! I'll find some random homeless guy or a junkie and give my body to them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that happens, it'll be your fault!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that declaration, she began to struggle fiercely against him. Osborne tightened his grip instinctively, and a smirk crept onto Emma's face as she felt him respond to her defiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me, how much time do you need to get ready? I don't like to force anyone, but you have to give me a deadline."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was at a loss for words. "That's not what I meant! I was trying to say that you should give me some time to reason with you, to persuade you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma froze for a moment, taken aback by his response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, her anger flared again, and she started thrashing around. "You don't get to convince me! I've made up my mind. Today, I'm unlocking Satan's Eye!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're not willing to help me, I'll just find someone else!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go of me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Either you knock me out or kill me; otherwise, I'm definitely unlocking Satan's Eye today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's determination was unyielding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued, "Seriously? I nearly risked my life to help you, and all I'm asking is for you to help me unlock Satan's Eye, yet you keep rejecting me! Do you really think so little of me? Is it such a burden to share a bed with me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you've wounded my pride today!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've ruined me! I can't even show my face back the Augustine Estate. From now on, let's pretend we never met! I swear, I will unlock Satan's Eye today! And if you don't help me, I'll take revenge on every man out there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, madness and fury danced in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's brow furrowed deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt like Emma had lost her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never encountered a situation like this before and had no clue how to resolve it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, Osborne was grateful to Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had sacrificed so much for him, almost losing her life in the process. When he saved her, she was barely hanging on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had been even a few seconds late, she might have been dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But gratitude didn't equate to romantic feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't harbor any romantic interest in Emma, and in this situation, he couldn't justify sleeping with her, even if she insisted he wouldn't have to take responsibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what would happen to Emma if he didn't act?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Osborne, Emma was a proud woman but also a sensitive one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her current frenzy wasn't an act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he let her go, she would undoubtedly do something reckless&mdash;find a random man to misuse her body and exact revenge on all men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that point, Emma would be a complete lunatic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She claimed he had destroyed her, and in a way, she was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, "What do I do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he pondered, a lightbulb went off in his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sixth-level ability of Satan's Eye is Memory Control!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "What if I could manipulate Emma's memories, make her forget today's events, and erase the thought of unlocking Satan's Eye? Wouldn't that solve everything?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to control her memories, I'd need her full cooperation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Memory Control was a mental attack, and while his mental strength was formidable, Emma's own psychic abilities were equally powerful. After all, one of her powers was Psychic Blast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Emma resisted, it would be nearly impossible for him to manipulate her memories, and he could even suffer a backlash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can I get Emma to cooperate?" Osborne wondered as a plan began to take shape in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's voice cut through his thoughts. "Why aren't you speaking?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me go! I won't bother you anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and said, "Emma, if I help you unlock Satan's Eye, will you stop causing trouble?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's eyes brightened at his words. "Are you willing to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "You've put me in a tough spot. If I refuse now, it wouldn't be very manly of me, would it? But for something like this, we need to be completely relaxed. Are you sure you're ready?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma's body trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, she was nervous. She bit her lip and said, "I... I'm ready! I don't know what to do, so I'll follow your lead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded firmly. "Good, you'll follow my lead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally released Emma, turning her body to face him. Grasping her shoulders firmly, he locked eyes with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, relax. Don't resist!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
