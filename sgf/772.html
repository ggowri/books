  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Osborne felt a bit helpless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He hadn't intended to get involved and certainly wasn't interested in challenging the Godson Rankings. After all, he was currently disguised as Axell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if he made it onto the Godson Rankings, it would be under Axell's name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne couldn't help but wonder how Axell would react if he found out his name had appeared on the Godson Rankings as one of the Godsons.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne shook his head, dismissing the thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, he was only using this disguise for a few days. Once he left Tethynia, he'd return to his real identity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Axell Lambert from the Lambert family of Rosmandi, victorious!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Axell, congratulations on defeating Andrew Perry. You will now take his spot on the Godson Rankings, 465th among the Godsons!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Please, take your seat!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The challenges from others will continue."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jackie approached with a smile, announcing Osborne's victory and motioning for him to sit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne hesitated for a moment, but then nodded and walked to the seat that had belonged to Andrew, slowly sitting down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The surrounding Godsons all had their eyes on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne didn't care. His expression remained calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The challenges continued after that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's victory over Andrew had renewed the confidence of the crowd below. Soon, more people stepped onto the stage to challenge their chosen opponents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne silently observed the ongoing challenges.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He noticed that sitting in this elevated position, looking down at the others, gave a certain sense of satisfaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your name is Axell? Isn't the Lambert family known for their fire elemental powers? Yet you've unlocked spatial abilities and even mastered the Spatial Domain. Impressive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, the man sitting to Osborne's left spoke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne glanced at the badge on the man's chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was Ron Adams, from the Adams family in Marcelin. He ranked 460th on the Godson Rankings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Adams family from Marcelin?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne raised his brow. The Adams family was also part of the Divine Family and a very powerful one at that. This man was ranked even higher than Andrew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thanks for the compliment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne replied calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ron smiled lightly. "We should spar sometime. Spatial abilities are extremely rare, maybe one in decades. I'd love to test the strength of your Spatial Domain myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled faintly. "The opportunity will come."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, he turned his attention back to the ongoing battles, not wanting to continue the conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A glimmer flashed in Ron's eyes as he continued, "But be careful. Rhett angered a key figure in the Eityreia Organization. That person ordered a hit on several important members of your family as retaliation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You messed up that person's plan by defeating Roger and Andrew. You'll likely be one of their main assassination targets and will draw so much attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Eityreia assassins...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even the League of Divine Descent avoids them. Plenty of S-Class Overlords have fallen to their assassins.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're strong, but... you'd better be careful."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying that, Ron fell silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne furrowed his brow. So Rhett had offended someone high up in the Eityreia Organization?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, that person had ordered the deaths of key Lambert family members in retaliation?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And he would be one of the main targets?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What a disaster, through no fault of his own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, remembering that the top Eityreia assassin, Emperor Dare, was likely the one who kidnapped his parents. Osborne's eyes gleamed with cold determination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Eityreia Organization, huh?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you want to kill me, bring it on!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne kept watching the matches. Unfortunately, all the remaining challengers failed. Aside from him, no one else broke into the Godson Rankings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, since there are no more challengers, today's Godson Rankings challenge is over!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Next, it's time for you Godsons to challenge each other to improve your rankings. Anyone interested can begin now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jackie said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I want to challenge!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A cold voice suddenly broke through.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emi stood up and pointed at Osborne, her voice icy. "I challenge him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was momentarily stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emi was challenging him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmph! How could an AA-class weakling get onto the Godson Rankings? Fine, but being ranked above me? That, I can't accept!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I, Emi Byrd, refuse to let an AA-class trash rank higher than me! So, fight me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Emi had already stepped onto the platform, glaring at Osborne with fierce intent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone turned their gaze toward Osborne, amusement flashing across their faces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne sighed, feeling somewhat helpless, as he stood up.</p><div class="pagination">
