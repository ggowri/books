  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had no idea that the residual spatial energy he left behind had led Jethro to mistakenly believe he was the God of Space, prompting the elder to rush off to report to the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only reason he had been able to spy on Jethro was due to his Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not wanting to return to the Pioneers of Starlight base just yet, Osborne took a roundabout route outside Apocalypse City, making sure Jethro hadn't followed him before finally allowing himself to breathe a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Thank goodness he could sense my presence but couldn't track me down! That would have been a real hassle! The power of a Supernal Deity King is even greater than I imagined. Right now, I'm definitely not a match for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if I pulled out all the stops and used every trick up my sleeve, there's no way I could take down a Supernal Deity King! My best bet would be to escape; actually defeating one is out of the question!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Merging Divine Flame with Divine Body..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pondered as he glanced at his own Divine Flame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His was unique, unlike others, which were colored according to their Divine Body's tier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level One had a red flame, Level Two an orange flame, and so on, up to the violet flame of Level Seven, the silver of Level Eight, and the golden flame of Level Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Divine Body was transparent. Generally speaking, only those whose Divine Body didn't even reach Level One would have a transparent Divine Flame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne's Divine Flame remained transparent regardless of its level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, this didn't mean his Divine Flame was weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, despite being transparent, Osborne's Divine Flame burned with a fierceness unmatched by anyone he'd encountered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once I reach the peak of Deity King, I'll be able to merge my Divine Flame with my Divine Body, right? With my Divine Body at the pinnacle of Level Ten, having reached the limits of Celestara, what kind of power boost would that bring?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a thrill of anticipation, though he knew it was a bit premature to think about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For one, he was still only in the mid-stages of Deity King, far from the pinnacle. And two, merging Divine Flame with Divine Body was no easy feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hudson family was a Dukedom Level Power, and even just from what he had seen, there were over a thousand peak Deity Kings. Yet, he had only spotted a single Supernal Deity King&mdash;Jethro.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fusion of Divine Flame and Divine Body was not only incredibly challenging but also tremendously dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll think about all that later!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For now, I have a clear sense of the power of a Supernal Deity King, and it's time to adjust my plans. Previously, I underestimated both the Baxter family and the Faulkner family, thinking my strength was sufficient to face them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, it's clear I was naive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To deal with the traitorous forces of the Human Community represented by the Baxter and Faulkner families, a blunt confrontation won't work. At least, not now. We must proceed carefully, keeping a low profile until we're strong enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I can't provoke the Baxter family too soon; if their Supernal Deity King intervenes, it'll be a real headache..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As these thoughts churned in his mind, Osborne finally arrived back at the Pioneers of Starlight base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well? Did you see the Supernal Deity King?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia and the others quickly gathered around, curiosity written all over their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded and proceeded to share what he had witnessed with Jethro.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he finished, their mouths dropped in astonishment, their expressions wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Supernal Deity King, that strong? You were hiding in a parallel space so far away, and just a glance at him was enough for him to spot you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine Flame merging with Divine Body?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ascension Stairway?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Hudson family has a staggering 500 thousand troops training hard? Over 10 thousand Deity Kings? More than a thousand peak Deity Kings? And the Baxter family is even stronger than the Hudson family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shock painted the faces of everyone present, their brows furrowed tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could feel the weight of pressure settling in around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some time now, they had been riding high on confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the East Zone, they had set up a challenge platform, calling out the young geniuses from various races under the banner of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings. They had defeated every challenger, shining brightly in Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From that moment on, each of them had developed a blind faith in their abilities, convinced they had reached the pinnacle of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, as they learned about the Hudson family's might, their confidence began to crumble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out there were so many super warriors in this world!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They realized just how far they still had to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whew! I'm heading back to Hope Haven to train! I need to reach the peak of Deity King as soon as possible! Osborne, make sure you set up a hundredfold time acceleration for us!" Zoe said, her expression serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going into seclusion too! I feel so vulnerable right now!" Kendra added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled gently, "Go ahead and train! But don't worry too much. With your talents, I'm sure reaching Supernal Deity King is just a matter of time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group nodded, though their expressions remained grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, they all entered Hope Haven, immersing themselves in intensive training under a hundredfold time acceleration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Anastasia stayed behind.</span></p><div class="pagination">
