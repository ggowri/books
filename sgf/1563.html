  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, the next day arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bright and early, Bruno knocked enthusiastically on Osborne's door, eager to take him to the grand assembly at the training grounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they arrived, Osborne was struck by the sight before him. Thousands of soldiers had gathered, a sea of faces all waiting for the weekly assembly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy, as the Leader of ten thousand, would address the troops and oversee the inspection. In Lachlan's memories, he had attended many of these gatherings, but as a mere squad leader, he had always stood among the crowd, easily overlooked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, however, things were different. As a centurion, Osborne stood proudly on the high platform, a place typically reserved for Guy and other chiliarchs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Today, Bruno had brought him up to stand behind Guy, side by side with several other chiliarchs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was the only centurion on that stage, and the sight caused quite a stir among the gathered troops.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whispers rippled through the crowd, both among the regular members and the squad leaders. Eyes widened in surprise as they took in the unusual sight of Osborne standing where only the highest-ranking officers normally stood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the chiliarchs exchanged looks of disbelief; their curiosity piqued as they sized him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, since Bruno had brought him up and Bruno was Guy's trusted nephew, no one dared to voice their doubts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Guy himself had greeted Osborne with a smile and a nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The surprise from the crowd was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They looked at Osborne, their eyes filled with deep envy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Can you believe this guy? How lucky can one human get? Guy's actually taken a shine to him! He's just a centurion, yet here he is, up on the platform with Guy, inspecting us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, we're all centurions, but why is he getting this kind of treatment?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Looks like he's on the fast track to becoming a chiliarch himself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why can't I catch a break like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most of the soldiers didn't recognize Osborne at first; their lives were consumed by military duties, leaving them out of the loop regarding the latest happenings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But soon, someone recognized Osborne, and news of his deeds quickly spread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? That's Lachlan? He's now going by Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He just broke through to Celestial Deity and toyed with Deity Overlord Fabian?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Did he really get his hands on the ancient divine treasury?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's the one who founded Spark of Blaze? That's the top force in the Human Community! My family warned me not to mess with them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the whispers spread, the awe in the crowd grew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they stared at Osborne now, their envy was mixed with shock and admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Countless eyes were fixed on him, but Osborne remained calm and collected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, the inspection began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy went through the motions, offering words of encouragement to the troops before giving the signal for the day's routine training to commence. As the soldiers dispersed to their tasks, Guy waved Osborne over, signaling him to join him for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy called out with a friendly smile, "Osborne, come here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yesterday, I promised you that you could choose your own team! You can pick anyone you want, whether they're seasoned veterans or fresh recruits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've already given a heads-up to the other chiliarchs, and they're all on board with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So go ahead, start choosing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Guy finished speaking, several chiliarchs shared uneasy glances, their expressions a mix of wariness and anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seemed they were all worried Osborne might swipe their best members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Guy's word was law, and they couldn't object. So, they silently hoped that Osborne wouldn't choose their elite troops.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne grinned. "Mr. Guy Borden, since you're supporting me so much, I won't hold back! I've already decided on the team members I want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Osborne handed Guy a neatly written list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Here's my selection, a total of one hundred and ten members! I hope these people can join my team. Is there any problem with that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy raised an eyebrow and chuckled. "You've got it all picked out already? Let me see who you've chosen. Since I said you could pick freely, I won't go back on my word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Anyone on this list who meets the criteria is all yours!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he quickly scanned the list, Guy's expression shifted to one of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He suddenly looked up at Osborne. "Are you sure you want to take these individuals?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne maintained his smile. "I'm set on this choice! That's alright, isn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy frowned thoughtfully. "Well, it is doable, but..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He alternated his gaze between the list and Osborne, clearly wrestling with his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy's hesitation piqued the curiosity of Bruno and the other chiliarchs, who gathered around to see what had captured Guy's attention so completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once they caught sight of the names on the list, their faces showed a mix of bewilderment and incredulity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What? How did he choose these?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
