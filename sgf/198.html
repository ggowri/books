  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hadn't faced off against any metahumans from Class B before. So when it came to Apollo, he wasn't confident at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he used all his methods, he wasn't sure he could take down Apollo. Otherwise, he wouldn't have called Isa to back him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw that Apollo's team had at least two elemental metahumans, Osborne suddenly came up with a plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elemental metahumans above Class C all possessed elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Satan's Eye had now reached level four, capable of devouring any elemental essence to control the power of elements. Previously, Osborne had devoured Raymond's lightning essence, thereby gaining control over lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could devour more elemental essences, he would gain control over more elemental powers, even combining them to form new powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strength would skyrocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, it might even be possible for him to take out Apollo alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "As long as Apollo is dead, his engagement to Clarissa is off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he could date Clarissa openly and complete the Godfather's fourth test.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's a Class C plus earth metahuman and a Class C plus water metahuman. Though both are pretty basic elements, they are still worth devouring. However, two Class C plus metahumans are no easy feat, as they are good at defense, and long-range attacks won't work on them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I get close, Apollo will be a huge problem."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, thinking about what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need someone to hold Apollo off so that I have enough time to deal with these two."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled and asked, "Isa, how about you keep Apollo busy for me later?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa rolled her eyes. "Two million to make me deal with Apollo? Are you dreaming? We agreed that I'm just here to protect you, not to fight Apollo. Don't even think about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, I can hold Apollo off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin spoke up. "I've exchanged blows with Apollo before. He's a bit stronger than me, but now I have Class B defensive armor, it's unlikely he can take me down quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin continued, "However, Apollo has many experts around him, ten Class C plus ones alone, far more than us. If they join the fight, I won't last long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, quickly thinking it through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew today was the best chance to take Apollo out, and he couldn't miss it. So he said decisively, "I have a way to thin their numbers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had Satan's Eye, which could see in the dark and through things, giving him an advantage in this dark wilderness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo couldn't see him, but he could see Apollo's people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Class C plus metahumans couldn't sustain extra energy defenses for long. Otherwise, their defenses would surely show flaws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And with just a slight flaw, Osborne could use a Class B sniper gun to take them out from a distance, thinning Apollo's ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Apollo's people were significantly reduced, it would be time for Osborne to act openly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't hesitate, immediately moving into action, taking over Valentin's sniper gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You guys stay alert here. I'm going to be a killer in the dark."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne disappeared into the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He observed Apollo's movements while holding the Class B sniper gun, looking for a better sniping spot. The dense forest posed no obstacle to him, his speed like that of a cheetah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he arrived at the side of Apollo's camp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo and his men hid behind some cover. Apollo thought that spot was safe from enemy attacks, so he had his two subordinates drop their extra power defenses to save energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was extremely grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn, I underestimated Skyefall Security. We haven't spotted their position, but they've locked onto us. "We're at a disadvantage now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he looked at his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Any ideas?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His men thought, and one of them said, "Mr. Apollo Chevalier, our absolute strength far exceeds theirs. The best move is to close the distance with them and fight head-on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another subordinate nodded. "We're just at a disadvantage due to the information gap. They have a special way to pinpoint our location from afar and snipe us, but our snipers can't spot them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But as long as we use extra energy defenses and forcefully close the distance, forcing them to face us directly, we won't lose."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo nodded, thinking this was indeed the best plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, then we..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Apollo was about to give the order, a lookout nearby suddenly had his head explode.</span></p><div class="pagination">
