  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now wielding the power of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, Osborne was not just any vampire; he had become the true patriarch of the Blood Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He possessed the ability to transform anyone into a Blood Clan member, ensuring that these newly minted descendants would owe him their unyielding loyalty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betrayal was simply off the table&mdash;no matter the cost, even if it meant facing death, they would stand by him without a moment's hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the leaders of those dozens of superpowers, there was no more reliable method to secure their fealty than to turn them into Blood Clan members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they were transformed, Osborne would have, in effect, complete dominion over these influential factions, as well as the surrounding nations. The Augustine family was poised to rule with an iron fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the future, Osborne could easily convert all members of these superpowers into Blood Clan followers, creating his very own reservoir of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, their standing would not compare to that of the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the very least, Osborne wouldn't provide them with blood energy to boost their powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, there was still a silver lining for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By allowing the roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to penetrate their bodies, he would treat them as a source of strength while also granting them a form of immortality endowed by the rejuvenating capabilities of the Lotus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, Osborne had no intention of explaining all of this in detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a drop of blood escaped his body. In an instant, it multiplied, splintering into dozens of droplets that rushed towards each of the gathered individuals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they stared at the blood, a chill crept over them, their faces twisting in anxious anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's voice cut through the tension, cold and commanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't resist! Whoever dares to fight back will face dire consequences!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the droplets pounced onto them, seeping through their pores and plunging into their systems.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The collective scream echoed in the air as Osborne's blood surged through their veins like molten lava, swiftly metamorphosing their very essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They trembled slightly but were paralyzed by fear, afraid to move too much lest Osborne decide to end them right then and there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Minutes crawled by before their screams faded into silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The agony etched on their faces melted away, replaced by expressions of bliss as they began to relish the profound transformations taking place within them, savoring the ecstasy of becoming Blood Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't long before the transformation was complete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In unison, they bowed before Osborne, exclaiming, "We bow before the forefather!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly. "Excellent! You are now part of the Augustine family, vassals who will heed the commands of my grandfather and the Wise Order without question."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!" they replied respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The high-ranking officials of the Augustine family watched in stunned silence, their gazes darting toward Osborne, bewildered at how he had achieved such an extraordinary feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was evident that these individuals had fundamentally changed; their reverence for Osborne was unmistakable, rooted deep within rather than merely motivated by the instinct to survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling the weight of their astonishment, Osborne hesitated for a moment before offering some clarity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian was the first to recover from his shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're saying you've made them Blood Clan members? That means they will never betray you or disobey your orders again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, a hint of confidence in his expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can rest easy, Grandpa. From the moment they became Blood Clan, they will be utterly trustworthy. They're in your hands now. I need to find Terrence and the others to deal with them once and for all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne's attention shifted toward Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More specifically, he was drawn to a girl standing just behind Bryce&mdash;Kendra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne flashed a gentle smile and beckoned Kendra over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra responded with a sweet grin and quickly bounced her way to Osborne's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, do you need me to step in now?" she asked eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded with a smile, his gaze appraising Kendra intently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was impressive to know that Kendra had ascended to godhood, mirroring her brother's prodigious talents. Utilizing Phoenix Ascension, she had forged a Level Five Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, what Osborne valued most in Kendra was her power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any individual she encountered stored their energy signature in her memory, never to be forgotten. No matter how well-hidden, Kendra could track them by following this unique energy trail, finding their exact location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne now sought to leverage Kendra's skills in locating Terrence and his associates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had orchestrated this plan well in advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew that while the Blood Demon members might overwhelm the Deschanel Clan in battle, annihilating every last clan member, leaving no one to flee, was virtually impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, Osborne had discreetly instructed Kendra to memorize the Deschanel Clan's energy signatures when the opportunity arose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that done, Osborne was confident that none would escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kendra, can you pinpoint them?" Osborne inquired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra's face lit up with pride. "Osborne, I'm a god now! My power has only grown more potent since then; of course, I can find them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've already locked onto their energies; no matter where they hide, I can sense them distinctly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I promise, my accuracy won't deviate by more than three hundred yards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give me just a minute, and I'll have their coordinates for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Kendra closed her eyes and focused, homing in on the energy signatures she sought.</span></p><div class="pagination">
