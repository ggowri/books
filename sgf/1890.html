  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne appeared at the Hudson family's estate with Anastasia, Zoe, and five others, drawing curious glances from the family members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary and the others had already met Anastasia and Hannah, but now the Hudson family members surrounded them, studying them with keen interest. The intensity of their gazes made everyone feel a bit shy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're all truly remarkable! That young lady there is a real beauty&mdash;are you married yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, you were picked up by Osborne? Are you his sister? Well, that makes you one of us now! The Hudson family will be your home from here on out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mystic Feather Clan girl, we owe you a big thank you for your help earlier."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's uncles and aunts surrounded the group, showering them with warm greetings, and before long, everyone was comfortably mingling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the midst of this lively atmosphere, Osborne handed the extra Ultimate Luminous Armor to Tristan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Tristan laid eyes on it, his face lit up with excitement, a grin stretching from ear to ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An Ultimate Luminous Armor was worth at least tens of thousands of Celestial Crystals&mdash;something Tristan could never afford. In fact, among the younger generation of the Hudson family, only Virgil owned one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he got one, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Zachary glanced at his terminal wristband, his expression shifting to one of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, your grandpa just saw our message! He's on his way back right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, Osborne felt a rush of anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd caught a glimpse of his grandfather Jethro while secretly observing the Hudson family, but it was from a distance. He hadn't had the chance to really take in the man's presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro was an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King, after all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, an overwhelming pressure enveloped the Hudson family's estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, an unassuming old man appeared before them, looking quite ordinary yet emanating an aura of immense power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where's my grandson? Where is he? Let me see him quickly!" the elderly man exclaimed, his voice tinged with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King, he appeared slightly out of breath, clearly having rushed back at breakneck speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer swiftness of his arrival left Osborne in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne recalled that Apocalypse City was a staggering 30 million miles from the Sanctum of Light. Even with the speed of the Supreme Malevolence Airship, it would take fifty hours to cover that distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, his grandfather Jethro had managed to return from the Sanctum in less than ten minutes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten minutes to cross 30 million miles!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Jethro didn't even have spatial power&mdash;he'd made the journey purely on his own speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, "Is this what it means to be an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't fathom achieving such a feat without the aid of spatial power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he watched the anxious elder, Osborne stepped forward respectfully. "Grandpa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Jethro's gaze locked onto Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His aged face lit up with emotion, and his eyes glistened with unshed tears. He approached Osborne, placing a trembling hand on his grandson's shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good! Very good! My dear grandson! You've grown so much! And you're the leader of the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings! Hahaha! Fantastic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro's joy was palpable, and he could hardly contain his excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streamed down his face&mdash;something he hadn't done in years, even as one of the Human Community's mightiest warriors. Seeing Osborne, however, brought forth memories of his long-lost daughter, who had been missing for over twenty years, and he couldn't hold back his emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's so good to have you back! Just so good!" he cried, his voice trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Around them, Zachary, Alicia, and others felt their own eyes misting over, fully aware of how deeply Jethro had missed his youngest daughter over the years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes glistened as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt the weight of Jethro's grip on his shoulder&mdash;firm and full of emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the sound of his voice, Jethro's eyes reddened even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! That's my good boy! Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, take it easy&mdash;don't crush Osborne!" Zachary quickly interjected, worried that Jethro's excitement might inadvertently harm Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro snapped back to reality, wiping his tears away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on! Let's head inside!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Jethro finally calmed down. He had already met with Sebastian, and now they were seated in the grand living room of Jethro's residence. Jethro and Sebastian sat at the front, while Osborne took a seat right next to Jethro.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, Zoe, and the others were close by, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro's eyes often drifted over to Osborne and the others, filled with warmth and affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I've heard about what happened with Trevor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That scoundrel actually tried to kill you? Don't worry; I won't let him get away with it! I'll make sure to help you get your revenge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A menacing glint flashed in Jethro's eyes as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly interjected, "Grandpa, you don't need to avenge me! I'll deal with Trevor myself, and I plan to do it soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fierce determination flickered in Osborne's gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro raised an eyebrow, surprised. "You're confident?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "Absolutely! If all goes well, I should be ready to take on Trevor when I return this time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent, everyone taken aback by his bold declaration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor was a Supernal Deity King, after all!</span></p><div class="pagination">
