  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo was in a highly miserable state at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He confidently brought a group of elites from Chevalier Security. He had initially wanted to show his strength and discuss cooperation with Donna so that Donna could fire her current bodyguards and hire bodyguards from Chevalier Security instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they were wiped out just as they had entered the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Except for him, who had embarrassingly escaped, dozens of Chevalier Security elites were all caught!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made Apollo extremely angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Donna, how dare you trick me? You installed the Draco Group's Class A defense system without telling me, tempting me to take the initiative to break in and test its strength for you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And then, you just watched me embarrass myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo was not a fool. On the contrary, he was smart and quickly figured it out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made him even angrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he couldn't say anything because Donna had told him clearly that it was not convenient to receive him today. He had been used to being so arrogant that he insisted on breaking in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Donna had just taken advantage of his arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Donna had told him that the Radcliffe Manor had installed a Class A defense system and asked him to help test it, he would definitely refuse outright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because he was well aware of the power of the Class A defense system.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even abroad, Draco Group's Class A defense system had an excellent reputation, and its strength had long been recognized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless a group of Class B+ warriors joined forces or a Class A warrior took action, it would be difficult to break through head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Apollo was confident, he was only at Class B. He couldn't break through its defense with a group of bodyguards at Class D.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fact that they were not killed was a sign of mercy from Donna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo growled, extremely angry, but soon calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "With this defense system, I have to be more careful in the Radcliffe Manor from now on. At least I can't be as arrogant as before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as long as the Radcliffe family isn't crazy, they will never dare to hurt me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that thought, Apollo regained confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took out his cell phone and dialed Donna's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna answered Apollo's call and couldn't help but frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Donna, what's wrong?" asked Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apollo asked us to release his men. He also asked us to immediately stop all cooperation with Skyefall Security and said that Chevalier Security would take on the security services for the Radcliffe Manor."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna looked gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she hadn't known how powerful this Class A defense system was, in order not to offend the Chevalier family, Donna might have really agreed to Apollo's request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, how could she agree to it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stopping cooperating with Skyefall Security and handing over security to Chevalier Security, who could guarantee Clarissa's safety?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chevalier Security didn't have a defense system of the same level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He goes too far! What right does Apollo have to ask us to stop cooperating with Skyefall Security and hand over Clarissa's security to Chevalier Security? Dozens of elites of Chevalier Security are still lying there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They are a bunch of rubbish. Can they protect Clarissa?" said Barlyn angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's expression was also terrible, and she said coldly, "Aunt Donna, just reject him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. I won't agree to it. But I can't refuse him directly. Otherwise, we will completely offend him, and it will be very troublesome in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna thought, "How can I make Apollo give up without directly refusing him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Donna Radcliffe, why don't we let the Skyefall Security compete fairly with the Chevalier Security? Let them have an open fight, and whoever wins will be hired."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued, "Apollo is very confident. He shouldn't refuse. If his people lose, it proves that Chevalier Security is indeed not as strong as Skyefall Security. Then, Apollo won't ask you to stop cooperating with Skyefall Security, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna became excited when she heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's a good idea! But will the Skyefall Security agree to it? We have already signed an employment contract with Skyefall Security, so there is no reason for them to do this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "I think Skyefall Security will definitely agree."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna was curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said calmly, "Because, during this period, Skyefall Security was suppressed by the Chevalier family. All their bodyguards went to the Chevalier Security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chevalier Security has dramatically increased in strength. Apollo even said that Chevalier Security has far surpassed Skyefall Security in strength. He also said that the ranking of security companies in Skyefall should be changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Skyefall Security, which was once ranked first, is now not even in the top five. Chevalier Security would replace Skyefall Security and become the number one security company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, Donna nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are indeed such rumors, and many people believe them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, "So, Skyefall Security will definitely agree to this contest. For Skyefall Security, it's an opportunity to prove their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Donna Radcliffe, let me talk to Valentin. I promise to convince him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay! I'll leave him to you. I'll talk to Apollo!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
