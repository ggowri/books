  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, Leroy was stunned and looked at him in surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Through Telepathy, she quickly continued, "How can this be? How can you concede! You're better than me. I..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He explained, "It's precisely because I'm better than you that you should take first place! In the top 20 matches, opponents are determined by drawing lots. The first place in the group will only face the second place!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you concede, your opponent will be another group's first place, either Clara or another prince or princess! While I trust your strength and believe that no matter which prince or princess you face, you have a chance to defeat them and make it to the top ten.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But this is ultimately not reliable!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, it's better for you to take first place in the group! Your opponent will be another group's second place, and they are all regular contestants! This way, you and Clara can both smoothly make it into the top ten!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy immediately understood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She no longer insisted and nodded. "Alright! You're stronger than me. Whether your opponent is the group's first or second place, making it to the top ten is inevitable for you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I was really worried that if I got second place in the group, I might draw Princess Seraphina, the number one in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, during the draw! She's very strong. If I face her, I have no confidence in winning!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled and said nothing more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He walked straight to the edge of the arena, jumped down, and left the arena to Leroy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The first place in Group Ten is Leroy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The second place is Osborne!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After announcing, Zorro did not leave immediately but said, "Now, will all the first-place contestants from each group please come on stage for the draw!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the first-place contestants from the other groups also returned to the arena, including Clara.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, among the ten people, eight were princes and princesses of the Royal Family. Clara and Leroy seemed quite out of place.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd was also talking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Truly surprising! A Royal Family princess was actually defeated, leading to two ordinary contestants becoming group winners! If they have a bit of luck with the draw, perhaps both of them might make it into the top ten!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If that happens, a prince or princess will be eliminated from the top ten!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is really interesting!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the arena, the eight princes and princesses of the Royal Family were also watching Clara and Leroy, their expressions grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne was defeated. They also felt humiliated, and the Royal Family's honor was tarnished. Unfortunately, Clara and Leroy were both group winners, so it was impossible for them to draw Clara or Leroy in the lot. Otherwise, they would have loved to represent the Royal Family, defeat Clara and Leroy, and restore the Royal Family's reputation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone sneered at Clara and Leroy, "Even if you're lucky enough to make it into the top ten, you'll still be defeated in the end!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was Yunus, ranked fifth in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings. His gaze was dark and terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had the closest relationship with Yvonne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara defeated Yvonne. He was furious and eager to avenge Yvonne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara looked at Yunus and frowned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She seemed like she wanted to say something, but in the end, she held back because he was a prince.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But her concession only made him more arrogant and overbearing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sneered coldly, "You just got lucky, catching Princess Yvonne in poor form! If you fight again, she will defeat you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You better pray your next opponent isn't me! Otherwise, I'll easily defeat you and show you just how big the gap is between us!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, Yunus looked at Clara provocatively.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She bit her lip and couldn't help but retort, "Then let's wait and see! I hope my opponent will be you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Clara quickly drew a lot.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When she saw that her opponent wasn't Osborne, she breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the ten second-place contestants, only his strength surpassed hers.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since Clara didn't draw Osborne, she knew she was guaranteed a spot in the top ten.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't even pay much attention to who she drew.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She just showed it briefly and quickly stepped back. After Leroy finished drawing lots, she would go down with him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Zorro announced, "The first match is Clara versus Mason!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara looked calm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mason, ranked tenth in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, was previously considered the strongest among all regular contestants. Although he was defeated in one move barehanded by Seraphina, the first in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, it didn't overshadow his strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Of course, Clara didn't care.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "I've already defeated Yvonne, ranked ninth in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings. Why would I worry about Mason, ranked tenth?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Earlier, Mason provoked Osborne. Now, I can help Osborne teach Mason a lesson."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Mason was also very excited. His opponent turned out to be Clara, not one of the other eight princes or princesses.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was definitely good news for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Clara was also very strong and even defeated Yvonne, ranked ninth in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, Mason considered Clara one of the weakest opponents he could face, second only to Leroy!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt he definitely had a chance to defeat Clara and make it into the top ten!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is great! I actually drew Clara, not the other princes or princesses! My chances of making it into the top ten have greatly increased! Although I can't beat Princess Seraphina, I can definitely beat you, Clara."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Too bad I didn't draw Leroy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Clara has a Legendary Sacred Artifact. She's still tough to deal with! But Leroy seems not to have one. If I had drawn Leroy, I would definitely make it into the top ten!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who&rsquo;s lucky enough to draw Leroy?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Mason was speaking, he saw Leroy also finish the draw.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She glanced at it and immediately frowned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What a coincidence?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She actually drew Yvonne!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The weakest group winner, Leroy, drew the strongest runner-up, Yvonne!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, someone said, "Princess Yvonne is so lucky! If she had drawn another prince or princess, she might have been eliminated and wouldn't have made it to the top ten!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Unexpectedly, she happened to draw the weakest, Leroy!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As long as Princess Yvonne defeats Leroy, she can make it to the top ten! This way, the Royal Family's honor is preserved."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yeah, she's really lucky!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was talking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne saw the draw result and couldn't help but sneer inwardly, thinking, "Her luck is good?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is nothing but cheating, deliberate manipulation!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had just activated Satan's Eye and saw with his own eyes how that person manipulated it so that no matter what Leroy picked, she could only draw Yvonne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne did not stop it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom thought that by having Yvonne draw Leroy, they could help Yvonne advance to the top ten and restore their dignity and glory.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Little did they know, this was the worst possible draw for Yvonne and the Royal Family, as she would lose to an ordinary contestant for the second time!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the Royal Family would lose face once again!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leroy is no weaker than Clara. If Clara can defeat Yvonne, so can Leroy!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne smirked coldly, waiting to enjoy the show.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He kept watching the draw. At this moment, he was also a bit curious about who his opponent would be.</span></p><div class="pagination">
