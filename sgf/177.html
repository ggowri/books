  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's convoy began its return journey to the Radcliffe Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But behind the convoy, several large trucks from Skyefall Security followed, loaded with various equipment and weapons of the Class A defense system.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin's efficiency was swift. After signing the contract, he immediately brought the equipment and security personnel to the Radcliffe Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He seems even more eager than us..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna turned to look at the convoy behind and couldn't help but murmur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't understand why Osborne could so easily accomplish what even Eugen and Apollo couldn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know that Osborne was the real owner of Skyefall Security, and she never dared to think so because, in her eyes, Osborne simply didn't have that kind of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna thought to herself, "Maybe because Valentin offended Apollo, and he's worried about being squeezed by the Chevalier family, so he wants to ally with us against the Chevalier family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt this possibility was very high. Only this could explain why Valentin agreed so readily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Donna felt a bit helpless. "Osborne's luck is too good. If I had known this, I would have negotiated with Valentin myself since he would have agreed anyway."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna regretted making a bet with Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the group safely returned to the Radcliffe Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin and his team started installing various devices around the manor. Osborne, as the head of security, accompanied Valentin on the inspection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They arrived at a hidden spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine," Valentin respectfully addressed Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled lightly, "No need to be so formal. You did well today. I'm satisfied."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin became somewhat uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, but these are my duties. However, we've made an enemy of Apollo, and there might be significant trouble ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, his expression grew extremely serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow and asked, "What kind of trouble?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They will soon squeeze Skyefall Security. Most of our business is in the Skyefall area, especially with many of the local noble families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Given the Chevalier family's huge influence in Skyefall, once they call for it, other families might cancel their cooperation with us, refusing to hire our bodyguards anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have a thousand professional bodyguards, but nine out of ten are on temporary contracts. If we can't provide them with jobs, they will definitely leave Skyefall Security to join other security companies. Then, it might..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Valentin could finish, his phone suddenly rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only apologize with a smile and answer the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, his face changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, Valentin's phone kept ringing, and his expression grew increasingly grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, something's wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just now, dozens of partners in Skyefall announced they were terminating cooperation with us and said they would no longer hire our bodyguards or use our security services. Moreover, they refused to pay the liquidated damages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They even said they're not afraid of us suing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They are going too far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, the Chevalier family just announced the acquisition of Skyefall's second-ranked Horizon Security, renaming it Chevalier Security, thus entering the security industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Almost all of our temporary bodyguards, under Judith's instigation, left Skyefall Security with her to join Chevalier Security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apollo has started his move."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin's eyes were filled with anger and helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Chevalier family's combination punch hit Skyefall Security's vital points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo first used the Chevalier family's immense influence to force Skyefall Security's partners to terminate cooperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Apollo acquired Skyefall Security's competitor, offering high prices to attract Skyefall Security's temporary bodyguards to mass-switch jobs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If those bodyguards all leave, Skyefall Security's staff will be reduced to about a hundred people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a large security company, that number was too small, and it might not even be able to operate normally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, what should we do now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin was anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had expected Apollo to retaliate, but he didn't anticipate the retaliation to be so fierce that it could shut down Skyefall Security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression was also grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyefall Security was a reward from the Godfather, and he had just taken over, but it faced the prospect of closure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter the reason, Osborne couldn't accept this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyefall Security had been running well, being the top security company in Skyefall. Under his management, it was on the brink of closing down in just a few days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How will the Godfather view me? Will he think I'm incompetent?" Thinking of this, Osborne snorted coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, I have a plan. Since Apollo wants to play, let's play along. I want to see how he plans to shut down Skyefall Security."</span></p><div class="pagination">
