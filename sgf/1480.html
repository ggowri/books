  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spark of Blaze was officially established!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aside from Osborne, every member of Spark of Blaze was just a lowly slave, recently rescued from the depths of despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could have imagined that this organization, composed almost entirely of former slaves, might one day ignite a blazing fire that would cast a long shadow over Celestara, instilling fear in the hearts of other races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even Osborne himself dared to dream that far ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Spark of Blaze was merely a fledgling group, uncertain if it would survive to see another day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, the most powerful warriors were three women who had only recently broken through to the Celestial Deity realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Betty, you're going to be the vice leader of Spark of Blaze!" Osborne announced, his voice steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the formation of the organization, he was determined to ensure its survival and growth, aspiring for it to become a formidable force protecting the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During their earlier discussions, he had recognized Betty's strong will and her status as the most powerful among them, making her the ideal candidate for the role of vice leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I also serve as a squad leader in the Wild Flame Army, which means I'll often have to leave Wild Flame City for missions. When I'm away, I'll be counting on you to keep things running smoothly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! I won't let you down, Mr. Lachlan Swift!" Betty replied, her voice ringing with confidence, embodying the spirit of a fierce general.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With our numbers still small, we won't split into smaller groups just yet. Our main goal right now is to establish a solid foothold in Wild Flame City and survive! There will be many challenges ahead, and in time, I'll reassess everyone's roles based on their performance and capabilities."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's words were met with nods of agreement from the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze then drifted to the back of the room, resting on the 52 hundred prisoners of war.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These captives hailed from the West Zone and were the true elite&mdash;a group known as the Pioneers of Starlight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being just 50 thousand strong, they had stood their ground against a million-strong Dark Deity Legion, fighting to the last man without retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many among them were even stronger than Betty and her sisters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, they wore expressions of defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Osborne announce the formation of Spark of Blaze stirred a flicker of excitement in their eyes, but it was quickly overshadowed by a profound sense of despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They felt like husks of their former selves, their bodies battered and broken, each one a fragment of what they once were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their divine power had been shattered, leaving them incapable of even the slightest spark of their former strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even those who had once possessed the might of Transcendent Deities or Celestial Deities now felt utterly powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For them, living in such a state felt worse than death itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the group had been discussing the formation of the faction, they had remained silent, retreating to the back, fully aware that this matter didn't concern them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were just broken shells.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spark of Blaze didn't need them; they would only weigh the organization down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet deep within their eyes, a flicker of defiance remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They still longed to fight, still yearned to battle for the Human Community's place in Celestara!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they caught Osborne's gaze, they looked back at him, waiting to see what he would decide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would he let them leave?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That would be a death sentence for them. But keeping them would only hinder Spark of Blaze's progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty, too, was watching Osborne closely, curious about how he would handle the fate of these 52 hundred who had been reduced to shadows of their former selves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who here can speak for you?" Osborne asked, breaking the tense silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The over five thousand captives hesitated, their gaze finally settling on an elderly man standing at the back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne followed their gaze and felt a spark of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were a Deity Overlord?" he inquired, his voice rising with curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Above the old man's head flickered six withered Divine Flames&mdash;a clear sign he had once held a position of immense power. But now, the man was a mere shadow of his former self, his legs lost, his body shattered, and his divine power essence destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he seemed less than a common man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Osborne's words, the elder sighed deeply, his expression grim. He said, "My name is Darren Pollitt, and I was the vice leader of the Pioneers of Starlight. Yes, I was once a Deity Overlord. But what does that matter now? I'm just a broken shell of a man!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne offered a faint smile, sensing the flicker of resilience within him. "You may feel like a shell now, but that doesn't mean it has to stay that way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can lead this group, then I want to ask you all&mdash;are you willing to join Spark of Blaze and fight for the Human Community alongside us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren stood frozen, taken aback by the sudden suggestion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of Pioneers of Starlight around him were equally stunned; disbelief etched across their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren murmured incredulously, "Are you really saying you want us to join Spark of Blaze? Can't you see what we are? We've been reduced to nothing! Joining your organization would only be a burden for you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no need to pity us! We've escaped the worst fate&mdash;being sold to other races, being humiliated and tortured. We've accepted our reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, let's just forget about joining you. We'll take matters into our own hands and end our lives here!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
