  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group discussed for a long time, but no one could propose a viable solution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew that the Human Community could not afford to keep losing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "If this continues, the morale and fighting spirit of the Human Alliance will plummet. When that happens, the Dark Deity Legion might stop the border competition and launch a full-scale invasion. With their confidence and will to fight shattered, the Human Alliance could collapse in one blow, leaving no chance for recovery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victory is essential!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We do not need to win every battle, but we have to secure more victories. Another day like today, where we are completely defeated, is unacceptable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What changes can we make tomorrow to secure more victories?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had a clear answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even God of Light seemed disheartened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Light! The Hudson family requests to fight in tomorrow's border competition!" Jethro suddenly spoke up with a serious expression. "Let the Hudson family handle the battles at the Deity Overlord and Deity King Levels!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words caused the room to fall silent. Everyone turned to him in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light frowned. "Jethro, are you suggesting that your family handle Deity Overlord and Deity King Levels of matches tomorrow? You saw what happened today. Below the Supernal Deity King Level, few who step into the battle return alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro took a deep breath. "I know. But the Human Community needs victories. The Hudson family is willing to step up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have confidence in winning?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro shook his head. "No. But the Hudson family will fight to the very end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hah!" Julian sneered, "If you do not have the confidence to win, what is the point of posturing? What we need now is victory, not blind bravery!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro glared coldly at Julian. "At least we are willing to act, unlike you, who only knows how to criticize. If you are so capable, why do you not send the HeartUnited Alliance to secure a victory?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You&mdash;!" Julian glared at Jethro, furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!" God of Light interjected. "Let me think this over. Jethro, I admire your family's willingness to contribute to the Human Community's cause. But we are focusing on how to win, not who should step into the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community does not lack courage."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her meaning was clear&mdash;unless the Hudson family could prove they had a better chance of winning, she would not prioritize them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would only choose the strongest contenders for the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro opened his mouth as if to argue but sighed instead. He could not guarantee victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the Hudson family's recent rapid progress, aided by countless Celestial Crystals and Miracle Elixirs and their physical and elemental essences that far surpassed others of the same level, no one could promise certain victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimately, Jethro had done his best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether the Hudson family would pass over was up to God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The discussion continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if the Hudson family does not fight as a unit tomorrow, Jethro's suggestion has merit," someone said. "That is&mdash;teamwork.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, we picked prodigies from various factions. While their strength was exceptional, many could challenge opponents above their level. However, they lacked coordination, preventing them from fully harnessing their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So tomorrow, instead of focusing solely on individual talent, we should select warriors who are slightly weaker but have better teamwork and more combat experience."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This proposal quickly gained support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! Teamwork is crucial. Take today's final match as an example. Leopold, the strongest Ascension Four of the Human Community, is individually stronger than the Radiant Guardians. But in the battle, the Radiant Guardians performed better!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leopold did not coordinate with the Radiant Guardians, becoming a weak link. If they had worked together, we might not have lost the last match&mdash;or at least not so quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I agree!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Prodigies without synergy will only hinder each other. Coordinated fighters, even if not as strong individually, can achieve results greater than the sum of their parts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I support this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light nodded. She thought, "Finally, a productive suggestion has emerged."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tomorrow, we will select warriors who are strong, highly coordinated and have the most combat experience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know of a unit in the 56th Army composed entirely of the highest Celestial Deity Level warriors. Over ten thousand strong, we can select a thousand of them to form a powerful team!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That works!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We once organized a large-scale operation involving over thirty thousand warriors at the highest Deity King Level. They trained extensively to improve their coordination and kill over a million of the Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can select a thousand from that group for the Deity King Level match."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And for the Transcendent Deity Level... "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also the Deity Overlord level... "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suggestions poured in, and God of Light analyzed them swiftly, finalizing the lineup for the next day's matches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimately, the Hudson family was passed over for the Deity Overlord and Deity King Levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro felt a pang of disappointment but did not voice his frustration. He had to admit that with the new strategy, the Human Community's chances of winning would likely improve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day came quickly, and the matches resumed. God of Light watched from the sanctum once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the matches unfolded, their expressions grew darker and more somber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Alliance's morale plummeted further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Defeat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another defeat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And another!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Community won the first match. Ten thousand Transcendent Deity Level warriors wiped out a force of ten thousand from the Unity Clan, losing over seven thousand of their own in the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The victory reignited hope among the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, everything changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top talents of the Upper Race and even the Paramount Supreme Clan began to enter the fray, and the Human Community found itself enduring one crushing defeat after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celestial Deity Level&mdash;defeated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deity Overlord Level&mdash;crushed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deity King Level&mdash;narrow loss!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ascension One Supernal Deity King Level&mdash;devastating loss!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ascension Two Supernal Deity King Level&mdash;devastating loss!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ascension Three Supernal Deity King Level&mdash;crushed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ascension Four Supernal Deity King Level&mdash;narrow loss!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At last, the Human Community's second-day record was one win and seven losses, with the defeats even more brutal than the day before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The morale and confidence of the Human Alliance hit rock bottom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this continued, surrender might become inevitable.</span></p><div class="pagination">
