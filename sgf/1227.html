  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who am I?" the girl asked, her expression clouded with confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could tell she wasn't pretending; she </span><span>did</span><span> seem to have forgotten who she was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl pressed her tiny fists against her head; frustration etched across her delicate features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It hurts! Who am I? Why am I here? And where are my mom and dad? Wait... why do I even remember having parents? Who are they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice trembled with a mix of pain and bewilderment as she looked up at Osborne, her eyes pleading. "Do you know who I am? I think I've forgotten. Can you remind me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's brow furrowed deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a breath, steadying himself. "I don't know who you are, but I brought you out from the Deschanel Estate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Deschanel Estate? The Deschanel Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl murmured the name softly, her eyes suddenly lighting up as if a spark had ignited something within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne was poised to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she turned out to be part of the Deschanel family, he wouldn't hesitate to treat her as a threat rather than a mere child. After all, she bore five flickering blue Divine Flames above her head&mdash;a sign of her formidable power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she returned to the Deschanel family and regained her strength, she could become a significant threat. Osborne couldn't allow that to happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl exclaimed, her voice bubbling with excitement, "I remember! I know who I am!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm Mila! My parents predicted that Lord Malevolence would lead countless Dark Deities to invade Celestara and destroy the Celestara. They were going to fight him to change the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, they sent Ms. Divine Shadow to take me east, saying my life force was tied to that direction. But as soon as I got there, I was attacked by Terrence, the Deity Overlord of the Deschanel Clan. Ms. Divine Shadow got hurt, and I was captured..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He stole my Sanctuary Necklace and said he would use my blood and flesh to create a potion to enhance the talents of the younger generation in the Deschanel Clan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They were going to cook me alive! It was terrifying! And then, Lord Malevolence attacked, destroying all of Celestara. Most of the Deschanel Clan members perished, but thanks to my Sanctuary Necklace, some survived."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I almost died too. They knocked me out, and then... then I can't remember anything else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, right! Who are my mom and dad?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila's face was a mixture of joy and distress as she recalled so much yet remained puzzled about her parents' identities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood there, utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He studied Mila's face closely, searching for any signs of deceit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her innocent features radiated sincerity; there was no hint of a lie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "So, she's not lying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"According to her, she's not the Deschanel Clan's prodigy. Instead, she was captured by them before Lord Malevolence invaded Celestara, a 'genius girl' in their eyes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those hundred Sanctuary Caskets? They were hers, linked to her Sanctuary Necklace. Terrence wanted to use her blood and flesh to create a potion to boost the talents of the younger Deschanel members because of her talent as a Celestial Deity at fifteen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Lord Malevolence hadn't invaded and destroyed Celestara, she would have been cooked alive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, she's not the Deschanel Clan's prodigy at all&mdash;she's their enemy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mind raced as he looked at the girl before him, grappling with the implications of her revelations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila's little face contorted with pain as she struggled to recall her parents. She turned to Osborne, her big purple eyes shimmering with desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know who my parents are?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I feel like they must be incredibly powerful! I need to find them. I need to tell them that the Deschanel Clan kidnapped me, and I want them to help me get revenge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're so despicable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And that Terrence? He's the worst! How could he toss me into that cauldron and plan to use my blood and flesh to brew a potion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila waved her tiny hands in exasperation, her frustration palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a surge of conflict within him. "Should I trust this girl?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or should I just take her out, no matter who she is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he looked into her innocent, anguished eyes, he found himself unable to pull the trigger. Her purity and desperation tugged at his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Mila broke the silence. "You're the one who saved me. How can I thank you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at the pristine white Sanctuary Casket with determination in her eyes. "Maybe I could give you this Sanctuary Gem?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sanctuary Gem?" Osborne echoed, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes! That's right!" Mila's face lit up with excitement. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is my Sanctuary Necklace. I have a total of one hundred Sanctuary Gems, ninety-nine of which are black. But this one? It's the only white gem, and it's special!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Osborne could respond, Mila concentrated deeply. In a flash, the white Sanctuary Casket lifted into the air, whirling gracefully toward her open palm. It shrank rapidly as it floated down, transforming right before his eyes into a dazzling, translucent orb nestled in her small hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood there, utterly astonished.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The imposing, five-foot-long casket, which must have weighed tens of millions of pounds, had morphed into a delicate gem!</span></p><div class="pagination">
