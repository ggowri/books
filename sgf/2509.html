  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the ancient lantern in the courtyard was taken by Drum, the pink glow vanished, and Layne instantly recovered from the abyss of desire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, he was an advanced Empyrean Sacredness warrior. Without the influence of the Sacred Artifact, he returned to normal and immediately sensed something wrong with his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he actually felt weak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't just physical weakness but also a weakness of the soul, one so severe it had reached a fatal level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He clearly remembered that just moments ago, he was like a wild beast, passionately making love to that enchanting woman, feeling an endless surge of energy, wanting nothing more than to fiercely pull that beautiful woman into his own body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in the next second, he felt extreme weakness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Layne knew something was wrong and quickly climbed off the woman's body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I need to get out of here!" Layne quickly put on his clothes, ready to leave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, the woman finally reacted. As she looked at the small courtyard, now back to normal without the red glow, and at Layne, who had returned to normal and was about to leave, a trace of confusion and a hint of ferocity appeared in her eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She quickly got up and held onto Layne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Dussel, what's wrong? You just made me feel so good, I want more. Stay with me a bit longer, I even have new moves!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she spoke, a powerful seductive energy emanated from the woman. Desire instantly resurfaced in Layne's eyes, and he felt a surge of heat rushing from his lower abdomen to the top of his head, making him want to pin the woman down on the bed immediately and try out her new tricks.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, the weakness in his body made Layne snap back to clarity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This feels off.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He must leave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly said, "Forget it, I'm not feeling well today. Let's try your new tricks next time."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Layne insisted on leaving.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the woman kept clinging to Layne, using various methods to seduce him. If Layne were still at his peak, he could have completely resisted such temptation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, he was too weak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Previously, the woman had already absorbed most of his vital essence and soul power. Under her repeated seduction, he finally couldn't resist anymore. His hands began to wander over her soft, smooth body again, his breathing grew rapid, and holding the naked woman, he quickly moved toward the messy pink bed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes were filled with desire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation immediately made Osborne a bit anxious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Useless! I've already had Drum take the lantern away, yet he still can't resist the temptation and is about to be controlled by desire again. At this rate, he's still going to die!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately contacted Drum. "Drum, use telepathy to contact Layne and inform him of part of the situation."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Drum did not hesitate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Drum's cold and harsh voice echoed in Layne's mind. "Idiot!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your vital essence, soul power, and even potential have been mostly drained by this woman. If you don't calm down, you're doomed!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, leave here immediately, pretend nothing happened, and act like you have something important to do..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the words fell, Layne's body trembled violently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly jumped up, pushed the naked woman away, and stared at her in utter horror. "You're absorbing my vital essence, soul power, and potential? What on earth are you?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The woman was stunned. The charm and tenderness on her face vanished instantly, replaced by an icy and ferocious expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the distance, Osborne, learning of Layne's reaction through Drum, immediately wore a grim expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He scolded, "That idiot!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tell him to pretend nothing happened, yet he went and exposed everything! That woman knows the secret is out; how could she let him leave alive?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Idiot!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was feeling helpless and anxious at the moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the woman's face was filled with a vicious expression. She had no idea someone had told Layne everything and thought Layne had figured it out himself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She sneered, "Didn't expect you to figure it out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since that's the case, you won't be leaving. Just die here! Originally, I wanted you to die in bliss, but unfortunately, you found out. So now, you'll have to die in fear!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, the woman suddenly lunged at Layne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This woman was a mid Empyrean Sacredness warrior. Under normal circumstances, she would be no match for Layne, but Layne was too weak at the moment. He was instantly struck and sent flying by the woman, crashing heavily to the ground, struggling to get back up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at the woman in horror and shouted, "What are you trying to do? You dare to kill me? This is Blossom Cage, the safest place in Vice City. If you kill me, Blossom Cage won't let you off!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Layne still hadn't realized that all of this was actually orchestrated by Blossom Cage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was still hoping to use Blossom Cage to intimidate the woman.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The woman revealed a disdainful smile, "Fool! Do you think I founded Blossom Cage just for you men to enjoy yourselves? Do you really think this is the safest place in Vice City?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She laughed loudly. "On the contrary, Blossom Cage is the most dangerous place in Vice City because everyone I target becomes my prey, ultimately drained of their vital essence, soul power, and potential, helping me grow stronger!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're just one of my targets!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Today was supposed to be your final harvest, but I didn't expect you to wake up. However, it doesn't matter, you can't escape from here!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just be obedient and let me drain you dry!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, the woman walked naked toward Layne, extending her long tongue to lick her lips. Looking at Layne at this moment, it was as if she were gazing at a delicious meal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Layne was terrified at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He kept moving, trying to get away from the woman. Soon, he reached the edge of the courtyard, but the protective shield outside had now become a cage, making it impossible for him to escape.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No! No! Spare me! Don't kill me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After realizing he couldn't escape, Layne began to beg for mercy, but it was useless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The woman kept walking toward Layne step by step.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, terrifying tentacle-like things suddenly extended from the woman's lower body, with suction cups emitting a foul stench.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The tentacles shot out quickly, latching onto Layne's body, generating a terrifying pulling force, wildly devouring Layne's vital essence, soul power, and potential.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Layne tried to resist but was bound by the tentacles, unable to move at all. He could only widen his eyes in terror, staring at the strange woman and feeling the approach of death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So disgusting!" Osborne muttered from a distance, staring at the tentacles growing from the woman's lower body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he ultimately didn't look away because Layne was about to die.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What an idiot! I really don't want to bother with him, let him die here. But unfortunately, he's my only clue to finding my parents. I absolutely can't let him die like this!" Osborne thought, making a decision.</span></p><div class="pagination">
