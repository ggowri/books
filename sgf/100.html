  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s actually a powerhouse?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne snorted coldly. Being enveloped by this tornado, he immediately felt that there were countless wind blades around him, which were viciously cutting his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luckily, a force emerged from the Class B Defensive Soft Armor to withstand the power of the wind blade for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Osborne could clearly feel the Defensive Soft Armor&rsquo;s energy being rapidly depleted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In half a minute at the most, the Defensive Soft Armor would run out of energy and turn into regular bulletproof armor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul laughed out loud and said coldly, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you continue to be arrogant? So what if you have the Class B Defensive Soft Armor from the Draco Group? Under Ms. Reed&rsquo;s Phoenix Tornado attack, you&rsquo;ll soon be cut into a pile of broken meat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Even Ms. Radcliffe&rsquo;s Holy Light Healing was too late to save you. You&rsquo;re doomed.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul then looked icily at Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Ms. Radcliffe, it&rsquo;s your turn now. Ms. Donna gets tangled up in Raymond. Your bodyguards are stuck with a bunch of werewolves. And Osborne, you can&rsquo;t count on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Now, you can die in peace.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paul walked quickly toward Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa bit her lip. There was no fear in her eyes, only concern for Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was somewhat powerless at this point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He thought, <span style="font-style: italic;">I&rsquo;m not strong enough after all. I have too few means. When I run into a Class C+ metahuman, I won&rsquo;t get much of a handle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was even more anxious as he watched Paul rush toward Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Damn. Isa, why haven&rsquo;t you arrived yet? You&rsquo;re not going to break your promise, are you?&rdquo; Osborne shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And just then, the roar of a motorcycle sounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A motorcycle then rushed into the battle, drifted handsomely, and came to a stop next to Clarissa&rsquo;s car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Isa removed her helmet, revealing her long, curly hair. A faint smile was on her delicate, charming face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She teasingly looked at Osborne and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here, aren&rsquo;t I? Aren&rsquo;t you still alive? A wind-controlling metahuman. Not bad.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Isa finished and got off the motorcycle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne couldn&rsquo;t help but roll his eyes. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t pay you if you still don&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Isa glared at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She looked at Paul and Pamela and said, &ldquo;Go ahead. Which one do you want me to deal with?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne pointed at Pamela. &ldquo;That woman is yours. I&rsquo;ll take care of him myself.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that, Paul sneered, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you had help. But she&rsquo;s just a petite woman. What can she change?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Pamela didn&rsquo;t say anything but had the same look of disdain on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Isa smiled, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect me to be underestimated.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, Isa looked at Osborne and said, &ldquo;You must get close when you fight an elemental metahuman. Their bodies are brittle like glass. Get as close as you can, and they&rsquo;re screwed.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Isa stopped smiling after that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She then crouched down and then stomped on the ground. Her body then shot up into the sky like a cannonball, rushing towards Pamela, who was one hundred yards away, at a terrifying speed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Pamela, however, didn&rsquo;t panic and quickly waved her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You want to get close to me? Stupid. Phoenix Tornado, strangle her.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Instantly, tornadoes appeared in front of Isa, preventing Isa from getting close. The tornadoes were like blades, making it difficult for her to get close.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Isa acted as if she didn&rsquo;t see them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She clenched her fists and threw a punch toward the Phoenix Tornado, which was blocking her way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In an instant, all the tornadoes were blown away by her as if they had never existed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Pamela was horrified to see this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was also incredibly shocked. He knew very well how terrifying Pamela&rsquo;s tornado was. It would be difficult for him to break free on his own, at least for now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Isa broke it up with a single punch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Isa didn&rsquo;t slow down and was in front of Pamela in an instant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;A wind-controlling metahuman at Class C+. You&rsquo;ll come back to the Institute of Human Research with me. I&rsquo;ll study your body.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, Isa threw another punch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Pamela looked incredibly grave. She gathered several tornadoes in front of her body, trying to fend off Isa. However, they were still shattered by Isa&rsquo;s punch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Isa easily punched Pamela in the chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Pamela spat blood and flew backward, passing out straight away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Isa turned to look at Osborne and smiled, &ldquo;See? I told you elemental metahuman&rsquo;s body is brittle as glass.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She picked up Pamela&rsquo;s body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">So were Clarissa and Paul.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">No one expected Pamela, the mighty Class C+ elemental metahuman, to be knocked out by a single move from Isa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo; Paul was terrified. Looking at Isa, he trembled violently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Isa, however, ignored him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Osborne, I&rsquo;ll go back first. Settle the matter here on your own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;By the way, do remember to pay me on the final payment.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne nodded. &ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, Osborne looked at Paul with a sneer. &ldquo;Paul, now you&rsquo;re doomed.&rdquo;</p><div class="pagination">
