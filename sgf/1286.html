  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I want Grandpa, Anastasia, and even the members of the Augustine family to bask in the protection of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity and gain immortality, it's not necessary to turn them all into Blood Clan members!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as I can achieve the fifth step of the fusion process with the Lotus and combine it with the Breath of Celestial, I should be able to control the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity straightforwardly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that point, I could actively control the Lotus to implant its roots into their bodies, providing them with the same shelter and granting them immortality, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up at the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The fifth step of fusion?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne made a firm resolve in his heart. For the safety of his grandfather, sister, and the Augustine family, he had to quickly boost his strength and complete the fifth fusion with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity as fast as he could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only by granting them all immortality could he finally feel at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, I'm nowhere near ready to complete the fifth step of fusion! Even with the Breath of Celestial, my body can't withstand the requirements of the fifth step! I can't even manage the fourth step!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to become a Superior Deity first to attempt that! Once that happens, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity will protect not only my body but also my soul! At that point, I'd truly have a complete form of immortality. My soul could get crushed, and I'd still come back to life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only by becoming a Transcendent Deity can I achieve the fifth fusion with the Lotus. Then, I could even choose when and where to be resurrected... That's what real safety looks like!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, I'd be able to provide that protection to the people I care about!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In short, it all comes down to the realm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to elevate my realm faster!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Suddenly, Osborne's thoughts were interrupted by a chilling scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over in the direction of the Divine Shadow battlefield, he saw Evander, her opponent, letting out a horrified cry as blood sprayed from his wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frantic, he was trying to escape at lightning speed, unleashing every ounce of potential within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Divine Shadow couldn't keep up with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Evander dashed for freedom, Osborne snapped his focus back with a derisive snort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thinking you can get away?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In your dreams!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you're here, you're not leaving! Not even a Transcendent Deity warrior can escape from me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne vanished from sight in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, he reappeared directly in front of the fleeing Evander, who was on the brink of a successful escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evander's expression twisted in shock at the sudden appearance of Osborne blocking his path, but he didn't change direction; madness flickered in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of my way, you scum! I'm a Transcendent Deity elder of the Deschanel Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You dare stop me? Do you know what that means? You're declaring war on the Deschanel Clan! Our Deity Overlord won't let this go unpunished!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Move aside!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he roared, Evander launched a desperate assault, trying to blast Osborne out of his way and dash back to the Deschanel Clan's sanctuary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scoffed again, his voice dripping with disdain. "Even now, you think the Deschanel Clan can scare me? I've been locked in a death struggle with you guys! You're leaving your life here today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that declaration, Osborne summoned his divine power and threw a punch with all his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a deafening crash as the two forces collided, sending him staggering back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't necessarily lack strength against a Transcendent Deity warrior, but he certainly wasn't at an advantage in a sheer power contest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nonetheless, despite being knocked back, Osborne had achieved his goal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evander was forced to halt, his face flushed red from exertion. It was clear he wasn't in great shape either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that brief respite, Divine Shadow closed the distance, rapidly closing in behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow cast a glance at Osborne, her expression utterly astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She, who had always had the upper hand in battle, immediately realized Osborne had swiftly dealt with Eamon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer force Osborne displayed shook her to the core, leaving her mind in turmoil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was well aware that Osborne was, at most, an Intermediate Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, it took him less than ten breaths to take down a Transcendent Deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a feat was unprecedented, even during the Age of Gods&mdash;a legendary accomplishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne had achieved it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow thought to herself, "What a prodigy! Even Mila, the Sublime </span><span>Saintess</span><span>, pales in comparison. Perhaps I should encourage her to spend more time with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, thank you! If you hadn't intervened, that scoundrel would have slipped away. Had he escaped, it would've been the height of embarrassment for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then fixed her icy gaze on Evander, her eyes filled with lethal intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evander's face turned ashen with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think you're doing? Do you really dare to kill me? I'm an elder of the Deschanel Clan, a Transcendent Deity! Our clan still has the Deity Overlord patriarch. If you kill me, once our Deity Overlord patriarch regains his strength, all of you will meet your doom!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Divine Shadow couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deity Overlord patriarch? Is that supposed to be impressive? You're not the only ones with a Deity Overlord around."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she withdrew the Eclipsing Mantra, revealing her Divine Flame&mdash;six radiant blue flames.</span></p><div class="pagination">
