  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was deep in thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Merging with Primordial meant he would likely face the threat of the other eight World Tree offshoots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, there were nine of these offshoots, and each one aimed to find and absorb the others to grow into a true World Tree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Primordial was the weakest of the bunch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the other eight discovered Primordial, it wouldn't stand a chance and would be absorbed&mdash;and Osborne, having merged with it, would likely meet the same fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know just how powerful the other eight were, but he knew without a doubt that they were beyond his current capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, when Osborne encountered one offshoot in the depths of space, it had nearly killed him with just a single root. The sheer horror of that power still lingered in his thoughts, instilling a sense of despair that was hard to shake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the strongest beings in the Human Community, the God of Night, or Lord Malevolence, would likely struggle against such a formidable entity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, if Osborne merged with Primordial, he would have to contend with the threat of eight entities like that&mdash;if not even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the flip side, there were significant benefits to consider.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial had already informed him that the immortality bestowed by the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity wasn't true immortality. It was more like a temporary state of invulnerability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he faced something much stronger, even the Lotus' powers wouldn't be enough to resurrect him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, it was crucial for him to allow the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity to continue evolving, granting him a more potent form of immortality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, as Primordial grew, it would enhance his soul power and push his Divine Body beyond its limits, making him even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every one of these advantages made it challenging for Osborne to reject the idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught in a whirlwind of conflicting emotions, he wrestled with his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Merge? Or play it safe?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Merging would make him stronger, but staying separate could be the safer path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, determination shone on Osborne's face as he made his choice&mdash;he would embrace the fusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regarding safety, the realization suddenly struck him. He had already faced attacks from other World Tree offshoots even before coming into contact with Primordial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it hadn't been for the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, he might have met his end back then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, even if he chose not to merge and avoided potential danger now, who could ensure he wouldn't encounter new threats later?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who could guarantee that the World Tree offshoots wouldn't come after him again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given that he might be attacked either way, why not opt for the merge?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least doing so would give Osborne a deeper understanding of the World Tree, the pinnacle of life in this realm. Even though Primordial was just an offshoot, comprehending its essence could propel him further in his cultivation journey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, merging would undoubtedly enhance his strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Strength was the foundation of everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a world ruled by power, where weakness meant certain death in a realm filled with chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With firm resolve, Osborne spoke to Primordial, his determination unshakeable. "I choose to merge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crown of Primordial swayed slightly, pulsing with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Excellent! You've made a wise choice, and you won't regret it. Together, we'll absorb the other eight World Tree offshoots and ascend to the pinnacle of this world!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne offered a faint smile. "Let's hope so."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I'm ready to start the fusion process," Primordial stated, anticipation in its voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne eyed Primordial with curiosity. "You're telling me you can actually fit into my Soul Current Ocean?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won't blow it to bits, will you? And what about that decayed root&mdash;is it really a fragment of the true World Tree? Is that going in my Soul Current Ocean, too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hint of concern crept into his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial reassured him. "Don't worry, it'll be just fine! As for that root, it is indeed a remnant of the original World Tree. Its World Force has mostly faded over time, but the remaining power is still immense. Without it, I wouldn't survive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, once I enter your Soul Current Ocean, I won't need to draw power from it anymore. Instead, I can help you integrate it into your Divine Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This transformation will grant your Divine Body World Force&mdash;the strongest power in this world! But I can't do that just yet. I need to grow stronger first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in disbelief. "You mean to say you can merge that root into my Divine Body? It'll evolve and gain World Force?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His breath quickened at the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It sounded incredible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was a shame that Primordial wasn't capable of it at the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, just open your Soul Current Ocean, and leave the rest to me," Primordial continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, not wanting to voice any further concerns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This should be fine! After all, I have the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. If it messes around in my Soul Current Ocean, don't blame me for being harsh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, he released his grip on his Soul Current Ocean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A brilliant light radiated from Primordial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every leaf shimmered and vibrated, casting a soothing green glow that enveloped Osborne in comfort. Meanwhile, Primordial's towering trunk, stretching over a thousand yards, began to writhe in the radiant light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Primordial's massive form began to detach from the rooted base!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's voice echoed in Osborne's mind, serious and commanding. "I'm about to start! Do not resist! With my current strength, I won't be able to complete the fusion if you put up a fight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it!" Osborne replied quickly, his gaze fixed intently on Primordial's tree form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial's root system was incredibly developed. The trunk towered over a thousand yards, while its roots extended for thousands more, sprawling like a mass of tentacles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but think, "Those roots seem to be the primary means of attack for the World Tree!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The last offshoot I encountered in deep space attacked me with its roots!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And in the core of the divine peak, countless roots ensnared that massive humanoid statue!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That statue was the Shadow Terror Fiend!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just how powerful is the Shadow Terror Fiend? Even the God of Night and Lord Malevolence have been severely injured by it! Yet here, one World Tree offshoot had its trunk wrapped around the Shadow Terror Fiend, seemingly battling it and gaining the upper hand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a thought struck him. "That Shadow Terror Fiend attacked me, too, claiming to be the Creator Deity! It said it would take me down once I reached the Ascension Stairway... I didn't understand what the Ascension Stairway was back then, but now I do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Shadow Terror Fiend meant it would come after me when I broke through to the Supernal Deity King level!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
