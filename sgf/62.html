  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna Jewelry was a high-end jewelry design and sales company that had emerged in Mayby City in recent years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne knew about Luna Jewelry because he had heard Ophelia talk about it more than once. After all, the Caldwell family&rsquo;s main business was jewelry design and sales.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Luna Jewelry was the Caldwell Group&rsquo;s opponent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia once sent people to investigate Luna Jewelry but didn&rsquo;t find anything. They even couldn&rsquo;t find out who was the real owner. It was extremely mysterious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It turns out that Luna Jewelry is my Godfather&rsquo;s property.&rdquo; Osborne murmured, &ldquo;But now, it&rsquo;s mine.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The reward for the second test of succession, in addition to 500 million dollars in cash, also included the transferring agreement of Luna Jewelry. Osborne became the behind-the-scenes boss of Luna Jewelry and owned all the shares.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As the Caldwell Group&rsquo;s biggest competitor, Luna Jewelry had dozens of top designers, six exclusive stores, and hundreds of sales staff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Its total asset value was about the same as that of the Caldwell Group&rsquo;s.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was worth at least a billion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was pleased to get a jewelry company worth billions. The most important thing was that Luna Jewelry might have the top-quality diamonds needed to upgrade Satan&rsquo;s Eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Do I have to pay a visit to Luna Jewelry now?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As Osborne was thinking, his phone rang. It was an unknown number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He received the call and heard a pleasant yet decisive voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Hello, are you Mr. Augustine?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Yeah, this is he. Who is this?&rdquo; Osborne was puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Hi, Mr. Augustine. I&rsquo;m Alison Schroeder, your assistant from now on. I am also the general manager and chief designer of Luna Jewelry. I have some company matters to report to you. Do you have time now?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It took Osborne a few seconds to react.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Did she say she was his assistant?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">General manager and chief designer of Luna Jewelry was his assistant?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Are you still listening, Mr. Augustine?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her words pulled Osborne out of his thoughts, and he reacted quickly. &ldquo;Yeah, I am available now. You can come.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne gave Alison the address.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Not long after, a luxury convoy arrived at Isa&rsquo;s Institute of Human Research. Osborne went out to greet them but almost rolled his eyes as he saw the number of the vehicles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Was she really his assistant? This was a bit much. She looked more like the boss than him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon, the car door opened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A pair of long, straight legs were the first to appear. Then, Osborne saw a vigorous woman with a confident smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was stunned a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was so young and way too pretty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne had thought that the general manager of Luna Jewelry would be a middle-aged woman in her thirties or forties at least, but Alison looked to be in her early twenties.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She wore black-framed glasses, but they couldn&rsquo;t hide her smart and watery eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing Osborne, she immediately stepped forward and bowed slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the Alison who talked to you on the phone, Mr. Augustine.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne touched his nose, not used to being called sir, and replied, &ldquo;No need to be so formal. Come in.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison nodded, asked the bodyguard to wait outside, and followed Osborne into the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Next, Alison introduced how Luna Jewelry was doing. Osborne was not interested in it but still listened patiently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was also observing Alison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison was very beautiful, but Osborne ignored her beauty once she started working and only felt her competence, professionalism, and intelligence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">No wonder Luna Jewelry became a billion-dollar company in just a few years and became the Caldwell Group&rsquo;s biggest competitor. In addition to the Godfather being the boss behind the scenes, Alison&rsquo;s hard work was probably the biggest reason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He realized he should leave the professional stuff to Alison. Osborne had never managed a company and couldn&rsquo;t design or sell jewelry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">So he interrupted Alison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Okay, Ms. Schroeder. I have almost understood the situation of Luna Jewelry. Here is what I think.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison sat up straight, indicating that she was listening carefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You will still be the general manager of Luna Jewelry. I will not interfere with the management. It will remain the same as before. You can do whatever you want with it. You have my full support.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison was stunned. She seemed to have not expected that Osborne not only did not take back the company but even gave her more power than before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her eyes lit up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Okay, Mr. Augustine. You won&rsquo;t be disappointed. And you can call me Alison. I will do my best to make Luna Jewelry stronger.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne waved his hand, indicating that he completely trusted her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this time, he finally had the opportunity to ask the question that interested him most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Okay, Alison. Does Luna Jewelry have top-quality diamonds?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Alison replied quickly, &ldquo;Do you need top-quality diamonds? There are pieces of diamond jewelry in the warehouse and counter, but not many.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;The diamonds in Mayby City, whether raw uncut diamonds or semi-finished products are in the hands of the Ashford family. Recently, they have been very close with the Caldwell family. Their top-quality diamonds are supplied to the Caldwell Group first. We are competitors with the Caldwell Group, so&hellip;&rdquo;</p><div class="pagination">
