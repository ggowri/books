  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila, Bryce, Kendra, and the others were all on the brink of reaching the highest Deity King Level, with their elemental essences having already hit Level Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were in a position to grasp the Divine Ascendance Technique ahead of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they faced a challenge similar to Zoe's: their rapid advancement had left them lacking in experience, which meant their foundation wasn't solid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this situation, even with their elemental essences at Level Nine, comprehending the Divine Ascendance Technique was no walk in the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how high their talents or how sharp their insights were, it was tough to visualize something they had never encountered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they were to push for the Supernal Deity King rank later on, they might run into significant hurdles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if they could obtain memories from super warriors with similar abilities, as Zoe did, it would bridge the gap in their experience and strengthen their foundation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a solid base, understanding the Divine Ascendance Technique would become much easier, making their ascent to Supernal Deity King far less daunting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still, getting a Supernal Deity King's memory isn't exactly a cakewalk! I'd have to take one down first. With my current strength, I might have a shot, but it wouldn't be a walk in the park," Osborne mused, his brow furrowing in concentration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, determination flickered in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what, this is something that needs to be done! Anastasia's elemental essence is lightning, Mila's is light, Bryce's is water, Kendra's is fire, Diana's is earth, and Hannah's is dark and life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If we encounter an enemy Supernal Deity King with any of these elemental powers, we'll need to find a way to take them out and claim their memories!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah's life power might be tricky; life metahumans are incredibly rare. She might have to figure that one out on</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, dark elemental metahumans are easier to find&mdash;many from the Paramount Supreme Clan possess dark powers. If we come across one, we'll just have to deal with it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mentally mapped out his plan, deciding to keep it under wraps for now. He wanted to surprise everyone when the time was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the moment, though, the focus was on gathering Miracle Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their Divine Body level was nearing Level Nine, with Anastasia even reaching the late stage of Level Nine. To continue their progress, they would need a hefty supply of yellow Miracle Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leaving Hope Haven behind, Osborne ventured back into the divine peak to continue his search for Miracle Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he had spent two years and three months in seclusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the accelerated time flow, where a hundred times the normal pace had passed, only about eight days had gone by in the outside world. Osborne first created a Spatial Clone, sending it off to stir up some trouble in the territory of the Paramount Supreme Clan. This would draw their attention away and prevent them from targeting the Hudson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, his real body focused on gathering Miracle Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After five days, Osborne had thoroughly scoured the divine peaks in the North Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He calculated, satisfaction creeping into his voice. "Across the ten divine peaks in the North Zone, I've collected over 17 thousand Miracle Elixirs and around 25 million Celestial Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Celestial Crystal count has now reached 70 million! All members of the Blood Demon faction can successfully break through to become Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the remaining Miracle Elixirs, there are still 15 thousand left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Five thousand red Miracle Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One thousand yellow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three thousand blue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Four thousand white.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And one thousand black."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After tallying everything, Osborne couldn't help but let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he had some surplus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it still wasn't enough, especially the yellow Miracle Elixirs, which were crucial for everyone's training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With only a thousand in hand, it wouldn't last long enough for everyone to elevate their Divine Bodies to Level Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned serious. He thought, "I still need at least three thousand more yellow Miracle Elixirs!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, that leaves the Central Zone and the divine peaks in the West Zone still unsearched. The Central Zone has only two divine peaks, but they are said to be larger than the others, housing even more Miracle Elixirs and Celestial Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they're also more perilous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence and the God of Night were both injured atop these peaks! Plus, these peaks are located in the Central Zone, which is the headquarters of the Paramount Supreme Clan..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pondered whether he should venture into the Central Zone or head back to the West Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The West Zone had ten divine peaks; if he searched them all, the yield of Miracle Elixirs should be sufficient for their needs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the Central Zone posed its dangers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way! I've come this far. If I don't check out those two divine peaks in the Central Zone, I'll regret it! At the very least, I should take a look. If it feels too dangerous, I'll bail and head back to the West Zone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that resolution, Osborne set off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Central Zone served as the heart of Celestara, though its area was relatively small, taking on a circular shape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two divine peaks stood in opposite directions, resembling the eyes of a Cosmos Symbol. This symbol represented the harmonious balance of opposing forces in the universe, often depicted as a circle divided into two interlocking segments, one dark representing passive or negative aspects and one light representing active or positive aspects, with a small dot of the opposite color in each segment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this just a coincidence?" Osborne mused, studying the map and furrowing his brow.</span></p><div class="pagination">
