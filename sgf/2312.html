Agatha chimed, nodding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then turned to them, peppering them with questions about Osborne. Since she was the bearer of good news, the two women readily shared what they knew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, their knowledge of Osborne was limited to his participation in the Tempest Fortress City's city duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy exclaimed, "Osborne saved my life, plain and simple! Back during the city duel, when we were battling for the top spot, I was getting wrecked by my Sacred Artifact's backlash. Osborne could've just sat back and watched me burn, stalled a bit, and I would've been toast. Instead, he risked getting hurt by my out-of-control self and knocked me out cold!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever anyone else thinks, I reckon he's a stand-up guy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Leroy finished, Agatha nodded, a glint of understanding in her eyes. "Sounds exactly like something he'd pull."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha couldn't help but notice the striking similarity between their experiences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On that snow-swept peak of the Arctic Maw Chasm's seventh layer, Osborne could have easily stood by and let her kick the bucket, scooping up everything she owned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would've also eliminated a serious rival in the state duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne chose to save her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha flashed a smile. "He totally is! It's been awesome meeting you two!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Call it fate, but we're friends now. If you ever find yourselves in a pickle, don't hesitate to look me up! Gotta go, though. I need to snag some more points and lock down that top spot. Wouldn't want that guy to sneak up on me once he finally shows up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's catch up after the state duel blows over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a final wave, Agatha took off, leaving Clara and Leroy utterly gobsmacked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Agatha just said we're friends? Is she always this friendly?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha's status was anything but ordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a top disciple of the Resurgent Throne Palace, a First-rate Power, and wielder of the ancient Phoenix Bloodline, she was one of the most promising talents in the Ember Phoenix Clan. She received undivided attention and guidance from many of the clan's old powerhouses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being friends with Agatha would be a massive win for both Clara and Leroy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after she disappeared, the two women still exchanged bewildered glances, struggling to understand Agatha's sudden kindness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be because of Osborne?" Leroy asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Either way, at least we heard from Agatha that Osborne's alive! That's good enough for me," Clara said, a wave of relief washing over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Osborne hadn't shown up yet, they trusted Agatha. Someone with her clout wouldn't bother lying about something like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what now?" Clara asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Agatha had assured them Osborne was okay and would show up before long, they decided to call off the search.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A spark of determination ignited in Leroy's eyes. "Let's jump into the state duel! How about we team up?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We might be starting from zero, but with our combined might, we should be able to plunder quite a few teams!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that we're in the state duel, we might as well give it our all! Even if we just do okay, at least we can say we tried our best."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara nodded in agreement. "Alright! I'm game!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And with that, Clara and Leroy dove headfirst into the thick of the state duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy, having fully mastered the Sacred Artifact Inferno Drake Lance and holding a spot in the top hundred on the strength rankings, was already a force to be reckoned with. Clara, on the other hand, might not wield a Sacred Artifact, but her methods were far more unpredictable. After all, she was the one who used a quasi-Sacred Artifact iron chain to bind Malcolm, who was ranked eightieth, rendering him completely helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Strength-wise, Clara was in no way weaker than Leroy, and might even be stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Working together, the two of them could handle any team, as long as they weren't top-tier powerhouses or squads. Even if they couldn't secure a win, they were confident in their ability to make a clean getaway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they racked up plundered points, their names finally graced the leaderboard, their ranking climbing at breakneck speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The plundering within the Arctic Maw Chasm intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson, the top four powerhouses, were on a rampage, their scores skyrocketing ahead of the pack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was fair game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the other top ten contenders stood little chance against them, getting crushed like bugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not even the most formidable squads could keep up with their plundering pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Running into the four meant a certain plunder for themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four powerhouses' points were soaring, with Agatha's increasing the fastest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they knew it, the fifth day of the state duel drew to a close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sixth day saw the plundering continue, with clashes between powerful squads growing even more intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The audience in Frost Peak City was eating it all up, wishing they had eyes in the back of their heads to catch every single battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One second, Agatha was steamrolling a squad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next, Horace was going toe-to-toe with the seventh-ranked contender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Broderick and Benson were in the thick of it, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With so much action happening simultaneously, the Frost Peak City crowd was struggling to keep up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, the whole state duel had essentially become a showcase for a select few participants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the end of the sixth day, the leaderboard had mostly stabilized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In first place was Agatha, amassing an impressive 8.55 million points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horace secured the second spot with 7.63 million points, followed by Broderick in third place with 6.74 million points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benson took the fourth position with 6.28 million points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These four contestants were far ahead of the others, and there was a huge drop-off in points between them and the fifth-place finisher, who only managed four million points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad came in ninth with 3.21 million points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared took the tenth place with 3.07 million points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gustave landed in the 16th position, scoring 1.75 million points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara and Leroy tied for the 31st and 32nd places respectively, both with 770 thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Osborne placed 51st with a score of 300 thousand points.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By this stage, the top four positions were all but secured, leaving no room for challenges.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the battle for the remaining top-ten spots raged on fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conrad's squad was currently in ninth place, while the team formed by Eight Great Academies, represented by Jared, held the tenth position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the squads in eleventh and twelfth places were hot on their heels, and it wouldn't be a Herculean task for them to catch up. All they needed was to defeat each other or a similarly-ranked rival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If either Conrad or Jared were defeated and had a tenth of their points stolen, they'd immediately fall out of the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the final day of the state duel had finally dawned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the last chance for a final all-out fight, as everyone would head to the first layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm for a decisive showdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Osborne had finally emerged from the seventh layer.</span></p><div class="pagination">
