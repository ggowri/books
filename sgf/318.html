  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was shocked; it was the first time he had seen Isa so furious, and the first time he realized how terrifying she could be when enraged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, she wasn't using her full strength in our previous encounters! Not even a fraction of it! This is the real her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's horrible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is the true Night Witch?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught by Isa, Osborne felt as if a mountain was pressing down on his shoulders, rendering him completely immobile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his body being at a Class B+ and having absorbed the unique energy of the blood diamonds, making him nearly as powerful as a Class A martial master, he was utterly powerless in Isa's grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Isa's furious expression, Osborne internally lamented his carelessness in exposing his X-ray vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had known it would lead to this, he would have gone upstairs to check on his sisters instead of telling Isa he had already seen them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was too smart and instantly deduced that Osborne had X-ray vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Speak! How are you going to make amends?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's voice was icy and full of rage. No woman could accept that a man had seen her pure body without her knowledge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled bitterly, "Isa, calm down. Let me explain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? Still trying to weasel out?" Isa sneered, applying more pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gasped in pain, his body trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, calm down!" Osborne quickly said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I admit it. I do have X-ray vision. It's a part of my inherited extra energy, the Satan's Eye. As Godfather's grandson, I naturally inherited the Satan's Eye."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa said coldly, "I know about your Satan's Eye, but I didn't know it could see through things."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne signed, "It can see through certain things, but not everything. People like you, martial artists, or metahumans have a natural aura or power that blocks Satan's Eye's vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I can see through walls and windows, but not your body. The reason I looked at you strangely was simply because you're too beautiful, and I couldn't help but look a bit more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm telling the truth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't dare tell the truth and instead offered his speculation about the regular Satan's Eye's abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The anger on Isa's face slowly dissipated. She frowned at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you telling the truth?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, you can ask Godfather!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa pondered for a long while before finally releasing Osborne. "I will ask him! If Satan's Eye really can see through me, I'll gouge out the eyes of everyone in your family to ensure Satan's Eye is never passed down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She returned to the sofa, leaving Osborne stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought Isa's declaration was too bold. Did she really plan to ask Godfather about Satan's Eye's vision?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she even said she'd gouge out everyone's eyes if it could see through her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bluffing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but mutter under his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was formidable but not on par with Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne knew she was just venting her frustration and didn't argue further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally talking his way out of trouble, Osborne breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I must never use my X-ray vision on her again. Though her figure is incredible, if she catches me, she'll probably gouge out my eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least, not until I'm strong enough to defeat her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne decided to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I'll be going now. Keep the Satan's Eye's X-ray vision a secret, okay? It's a family secret, after all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa rolled her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do I need you to tell me? You better not have lied to me, or if I find out you've seen through me, you're done. I'll confiscate your tools!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly felt Satan's Eye throb as if issuing a warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Satan's Eye was afraid?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned. He vowed to improve his strength as quickly as possible. Otherwise, he might end up blind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it, I understand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said and bolted out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Osborne's hurried exit, Isa couldn't help but smirk. She murmured, "That kid, so easily scared? Daring to peep but not daring to admit it? Does he think I don't know that the regular Satan's Eye can't see through me? But his Satan's Eye mutated </span><span>because of his mother...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kid, work hard and improve your strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My time is running out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't wait too long!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa closed her eyes, and the room fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two days passed quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the day Osborne had decided to set sail.</span></p><div class="pagination">
