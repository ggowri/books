  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't Osborne who acted, but Alfreda!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda maintained an exaggerated posture, her hand still in mid-air. She watched Monica, whom she had just slapped, being sent flying and landing miserably beneath the Elf Tree. Her face was full of disdain and mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>D</span><span>o you really think I don't dare to hit you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just too noisy. I couldn't help but want to hit you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Alfreda took a deep breath and turned to look at Osborne, who was staring blankly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled faintly, "Alright! It's quiet now! I told you, if Monica dared to trouble you because of me, I would take care of it for you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just that now I'm in trouble. I guess I'll be punished by my father again! This time, I fear I won't even have the privilege of guarding this little inn. My father will most likely expel me from Elf City, leaving me to wander the world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda looked distressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>A</span><span>h! I was too impulsive! Why couldn't I hold back? But it's not my fault, right? She was just asking for it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, don't you agree?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but nod in agreement. "She was indeed asking for it. It's not your fault! If you hadn't hit her, I would have! This time, I'm on your side. You did nothing wrong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Alfreda smiled happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You mustn't hit her! This is Elf City; no matter how bad she is, she's still a member of the royal family. If you lay a hand on her, you're doomed! I'm different. Even though the Nature Elf Royal Family has declined, I'm still royalty. At most, it's... mutual combat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Fire Elf Royal Family might pressure my father, but they won't kill me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, she pouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I really don't want to leave Elf City. The scenery here is beautiful, the environment is lovely, and even the air smells sweet... I've heard it's dangerous outside. You could die if you're not careful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>A</span><span>h, forget it. What's done is done. There's no use regretting now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she took out two Miracle Elixirs, "Osborne, these are the Miracle Elixirs you gave me earlier. Since I'll surely be punished and expelled from Elf City, I won't be managing this inn anymore, and you probably can't stay here either. So, I'm returning your rent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at Alfreda but didn't take them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Alfreda had attacked to help him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, Monica had been trying to provoke Alfreda with malicious words, but Alfreda had forced herself to endure it. Despite her anger, she remained rational, aware of the consequences of acting, so she held back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when Monica started targeting Osborne, threatening to kill him, Alfreda couldn't hold back and acted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Alfreda hadn't intervened, Monica would have attacked Osborne. Whether he fought back or not, the situation would have been difficult to resolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Understanding this, Alfreda slapped Monica away before she could act against Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda intended to draw Monica's anger onto herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if it meant being punished or expelled from Elf City, she still did it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne bit his lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda appeared cute and quirky but had a kind heart. Osborne was very grateful to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't take the two Miracle Elixirs but spoke earnestly, "Alfreda, thank you for standing up for me! You didn't have to! If you're punished and expelled from Elf City because of this, I'll do my best to protect you! I promise."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda was stunned upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rolled her eyes. "What are you talking about? I didn't help you; I just couldn't stand her anymore! And you say you'll protect me? I'm an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King! You're only Ascension One...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I should be the one protecting you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wrinkled her cute nose. "But since you're so sincere, I'll reluctantly accept you as my underling! If I'm really expelled from Elf City, you can come with me! Stay by my side, and I won't treat you badly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she proudly walked to Osborne's side, intending to pat his shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her petite stature only reached Osborne's chest. She stood on tiptoe and barely patted his shoulder, making the gesture somewhat comical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Alfreda's offer to take him along was also to protect him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was worried that if he stayed, Monica and Desmond would target him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt warmth in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to say something when suddenly, a surge of flames rose. A figure bathed in fire rushed up from beneath the Elf Tree. Her cold, angry eyes instantly locked onto Alfreda and Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alfreda, you're dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you hit me? Have you forgotten the consequences of provoking me? You're finished! I won't spare you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Monica's shrill screams echoed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was in a sorry state, her hair disheveled, her eyes bloodshot, fiery thorn-like patterns on her face. She roared angrily, like a shrew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A clear handprint marked her right cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flames around her slowly formed a fiery phoenix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fiery phoenix swept toward Osborne and Alfreda with her shout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda snorted coldly, stepping in front of Osborne, and shouted at Monica, "Whether I slap you once or beat you up, the consequences are the same. Since I'll be punished anyway, I might as well enjoy it first!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Monica, if you're looking for a fight, I'll oblige!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Alfreda suddenly soared into the sky. The terrifying fiery phoenix was shattered by her punch. She then appeared before Monica, grabbed her by the neck with her slender hand, and lifted her into the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Alfreda slapped Monica's face repeatedly with a cold expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Monica was an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King, in front of Alfreda, she was like a helpless baby, unable to fight back. She was dazed by Alfreda's slaps, her beautiful face quickly swelling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood not far away, utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So powerful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at Alfreda, astonished. Earlier, when Alfreda had slapped Monica away, Osborne hadn't seen clearly and thought Monica had been careless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, he saw it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda used pure divine power to completely suppress Monica. Her divine power was even stronger than Icy Six, whom Osborne had previously fought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Icy Six was an Ascension Six Supernal Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Six was Lord Malevolence's right-hand man, and his strength was considered above average among Ascension Six Supernal Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Alfreda seemed even stronger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she was only </span><span>at </span><span>Ascension Five!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alfreda is quite formidable. If I could persuade her to go to Umbra Earth...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned deeply, looking into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There, a group of Elf warriors with flame badges on their chests was rapidly approaching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were the Fire Elf Royal Family's guards!</span></p><div class="pagination">
