  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne noticed something was off. The Infinite Devouring Eyes, without his command, had followed Primordial's roots straight into the emerald-green orb. He was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quickly, he tried to regain control over the Infinite Devouring Eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Primordial had made it clear that this orb was one of the nine Tree Hearts of the World Tree, crucial for Primordial's evolution into the true World Tree. It needed to absorb the other eight Tree Hearts to achieve that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to Osborne's surprise, once the Infinite Devouring Eyes entered the Tree Heart, he lost all control over them. He could only sense that they were voraciously devouring the energy within the Tree Heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This unexpected turn of events made his mouth twitch in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Primordial, I swear this wasn't intentional! It just went rogue on me! I have no idea why, but you don't seem too bothered by it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at Primordial, who was eagerly merging and absorbing the Tree Heart's energy, seemingly in bliss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enormous emerald-green orb radiated a faint crimson glow, and Primordial was at its center, frantically absorbing its power while the Infinite Devouring Eyes worked tirelessly at the edges, both processes happening without interference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like an eternity, Primordial's voice rang in Osborne's mind, filled with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what are you doing? Get that damn thing to stop! That's one of the nine Tree Hearts of the World Tree. It's mine! Make it stop now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial was clearly anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a wave of embarrassment wash over him, akin to being caught stealing. "I can't control it anymore! Since it absorbed the Crimson Energy from the Bloodstrike Orb, it's been out of my hands!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Are you kidding me? Do I look like someone who's gullible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial was skeptical, convinced that Osborne was trying to get a piece of the action. After all, even a fool could sense the pure energy emanating from the Tree Heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned, "I have no reason to lie to you! The Infinite Devouring Eyes are definitely out of my control. You should check for yourself. The emerald-green glow is mixed with a faint crimson hue, which is clearly Crimson Energy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Eighth offshoot absorbed that energy, and it's now mixed in with the Tree Heart!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Infinite Devouring Eyes are mainly absorbing that Bloodstrike Orb's Crimson Energy, while barely touching the energy that belongs to the Tree Heart!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial paused to examine the situation more closely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, it realized that Osborne was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Infinite Devouring Eyes were indeed focusing on the Crimson Energy from the Bloodstrike Orb, only absorbing a small portion of the Tree Heart's emerald energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Crimson Energy flowing into the Infinite Devouring Eyes, Primordial's ability to merge with the Tree Heart accelerated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Primordial fell silent, fully engrossed in the task of absorption.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But unfortunately, compared to the colossal Tree Heart, Primordial was still too weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne estimated it would take Primordial several years to fully absorb and merge with this Tree Heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several years?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't wait that long!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He made up his mind to help Primordial speed things up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the power of time surged forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne attempted to accelerate the time around the Tree Heart by 200 times, but he quickly realized he couldn't pull it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with all his might, he could only manage a fifty-fold increase!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furrowing his brow, Osborne pondered, "Is it because the Tree Heart's energy is just too immense?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The effect of speeding up time around it seems to be weakened. Still, a fifty-fold acceleration isn't too shabby. That means, at most, Primordial should wrap this up in about 10 days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten days are bearable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wonder if the Creation Herald got taken out by the Bloodstrike Orb. He managed to battle the Eighth World Tree offshoot for centuries without falling, so he must have his own tricks up his sleeve. If the Eighth offshoot could absorb the Bloodstrike Orb's energy to survive, maybe the Creation Herald can too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if he's been wiped out, that'd be great. If he's still kicking, though, I'll eventually have to take care of him myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A menacing glint flickered in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would never forget how the Creation Herald had forced the Bloodstrike Orb into his hands, intending to blow him up along with it. If it hadn't been for his time power, he would have been history!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Creation Herald! Just you wait!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath, forcing down his simmering hatred. Even if the Creation Herald had survived, now wasn't the time for revenge. After all, he was likely an Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King. Even if he was injured, Osborne was no match against him at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't waste these next few days. I need to find a way to boost my power!" he murmured to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he opened his palm, a diamond-shaped transparent crystal appeared, shimmering with a soft golden glow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, "This is the Spatial Gold Crystal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald said it comes from Umbra World and is incredibly rare. Not only is it a material for crafting divine artifacts, but it also has a tremendous enhancing effect on space elemental essence, far beyond what a blue Miracle Elixir can do!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald was even willing to trade 50 thousand Miracle Elixirs for it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That means, in his eyes, this Spatial Gold Crystal is worth more than those 50 thousand Miracle Elixirs!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Let's see just how powerful it really is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne settled into a meditative position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he waited for Primordial and the Infinite Devouring Eyes to fully absorb and merge with the Tree Heart, he focused on harnessing the power of the Spatial Gold Crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after several attempts, Osborne found he couldn't absorb the Spatial Gold Crystal at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wondered, frowning, "Could it be that the Spatial Gold Crystal isn't meant to be absorbed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What if I try integrating it into my space elemental essence?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, he enveloped the Spatial Gold Crystal in a surge of spatial energy. In the blink of an eye, the crystal vanished from sight, appearing within his body, tightly wrapped in his space elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne felt the Spatial Gold Crystal begin to dissolve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, an unimaginable surge of power erupted from the crystal, and his already advanced space elemental essence, now at Level Nine, began to absorb it voraciously, rapidly escalating in strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed of enhancement was staggering, far surpassing what he experienced with the blue Miracle Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could feel his space elemental essence swelling and expanding!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level Nine, early stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level Nine, mid-stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level Nine, late stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could hardly believe it. In just half a day, his space elemental essence had jumped two small levels, reaching the late stage of Level Nine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of his spatial power had increased at least tenfold!</span></p><div class="pagination">
