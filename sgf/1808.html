  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne still had no idea how his own Supreme Origin Colossus had gone missing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But right now, that didn't matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed his gaze on the Supreme Origin Colossus standing beside Hubery, a flicker of determination sparking in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since the Supreme Origin Colossus is so precious&mdash;after all, the Paramount Supreme Clan only possesses three of them&mdash;losing one here would surely be a blow they'd feel deeply, wouldn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery raised an eyebrow, momentarily taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had expected Osborne and his companions to be in a state of utter panic, especially with their backs against the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were surrounded by hundreds of Deity Kings, the Supreme Origin Colossus suppressing any chance of escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this situation, they should be begging for mercy, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But all he saw on Osborne's face was calm confidence, even a hint of greed as he eyed the colossal figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery asked, his voice dripping with contempt, "What's wrong with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you scared? Do you really think someone's coming to rescue you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! That's a laugh! No one is coming to save you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if there were, they wouldn't dare show their faces. Look around&mdash;there's me at the peak of the Deity King level, nearly 20 more late-stage Deity Kings, and over five hundred in the mid and early stages!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, there are dozens of Supreme Malevolence Airships and over a million warriors from various clans. Even if someone wanted to help you, how could they?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unless it's the God of Light or the God of Night personally flying in from the West Zone, no one's coming to your aid! Do you really think that's possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His disdainful laugh echoed through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne merely smiled, unfazed, "No one will come. But we don't need rescuing! Even though you've surrounded us, killing me isn't as easy as you think!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just because you have the Supreme Origin Colossus to suppress my spatial power doesn't mean you can hold me here forever!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you think that will keep us from fighting back, you're living in a fairy tale!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned to Anastasia and the others. "You guys head back to Hope Haven!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged worried glances, uncertainty etched on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His smile reassured them, "I'll be fine! I'm confident I can escape. Don't stay out there. That will only distract me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew they had to trust him despite their apprehensions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Promise you'll come back in one piece!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, "Count on it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, they swiftly entered the shimmering portal of Hope Haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery taunted, not even bothering to stop them, "Ha! You think a Dimensional Microcosm is going to save you?! What good is it when all I have to do is kill you? The moment you die, that Dimensional Microcosm becomes mine, and everyone within it is done for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Then come and try to kill me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's challenge rang out as he narrowed his eyes, charging straight toward a late-stage Deity King from the Paramount Supreme Clan, attempting to break through the encirclement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's expression twisted into a wicked grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for it! Everyone, attack! Take him down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the surrounding warriors sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alongside Hubery, the nearly twenty late-stage Deity Kings unleashed a torrent of attacks. Each one was on par with Caesar; their combined might formed a wave of overwhelming force that surged toward Osborne, painting a truly grim picture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!" they roared in unison, their strikes merciless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew how dangerous Osborne was since he was capable of taking down someone like Caesar. Eliminating him quickly was their top priority for their own safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In such dire circumstances, how would Osborne defend himself?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chose to do the unthinkable&mdash;not to resist at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne locked his eyes on a Deity King at the late stage, completely disregarding the barrage of terrifying attacks around him. With every ounce of his strength, he swung the Supreme Malevolence Sword ferociously towards his target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's full-power attack struck the late-stage Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force sent the enemy hurtling backward, a massive, gruesome wound tearing across his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that same moment, Osborne himself was engulfed by countless attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The devastating blows were far beyond his divine power's ability to defend. His divine power defenses shattered almost instantly, leaving him riddled with injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, he didn't die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's Divine Body was astonishingly resilient, already at the peak of Level Ten, nearing the very limits of Celestara itself. These late-stage Deity Kings might overwhelm him, but outright killing him was no easy feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's gaze snapped back to the heavily injured Deity King he'd just struck. A cold smirk spread across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!" he roared, ignoring his own grievous wounds, not even bothering to heal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He surged forward again, his movements savage and relentless. The injured Deity King's face paled. Panic gripped him as he yelled, "Damn it, this lunatic wants to take me down with him! Finish him off, now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a hearty laugh in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're damn right I'm taking you down with me! So, let's go together&mdash;straight to the abyss!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
