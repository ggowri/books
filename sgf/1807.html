  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Hubery caught sight of the reinforcements arriving, a cold smile crept across his face. A dozen or so late-stage Deity Kings surrounded Osborne and the others, sealing off any chance of escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, you're trapped!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter how powerful you think you are, you're going to die here today!" he taunted, his voice dripping with malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted, unfazed. "Not so fast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He surveyed the encircling Deity Kings, his eyes glinting with resolve. Some were from the Paramount Supreme Clan, but many were seasoned veterans from various clans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been watching the arena battles aboard the Malevolence Airship, and now that Hubery was personally engaged, they couldn't wait to join the fray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You lowly humans dare to kill Mr. Caesar Eldridge?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your sins are unforgivable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Death is the only way to atone! Get down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They shouted angrily, closing in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the distance, thousands of Ultimate Malevolence Airships and dozens of Supreme Malevolence Airships rushed toward them, creating a formidable blockade. Each ship was laden with hundreds, if not thousands, of cold-eyed warriors from various clans, all fixated on Osborne and his group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over a million foes surrounded them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wiped the blood from his lips, a smirk appearing on his face. "You think you can make me get down? You think you're worthy? I set up this arena challenge for a reason&mdash;I came prepared. Do you really believe that surrounding me will guarantee your victory? That's laughable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a step back, preparing to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The odds were overwhelmingly against them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With over a million warriors, including five or six hundred above the Deity King level and several Supreme Malevolence Airships with their main and secondary cannons trained on them, fighting was futile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's see if you can stop me from leaving!" Osborne declared, tapping into his spatial power. He enveloped himself, Anastasia, and the others in a protective bubble, ready to open a dimensional portal for interdimensional travels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, Hubery let out a chilling laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thinking you can escape with your spatial power? Dream on! Stay right where you are!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, he summoned a massive humanoid stone figure that glimmered faintly with power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the colossal figure appeared, Osborne's freshly opened dimensional portal snapped shut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His spatial power fizzled out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in shock as he recognized the stone figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was identical to one he had once possessed, a unique artifact that nullified spatial power within its vicinity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery had one, too, and he was using it to counter Osborne's escape!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery, reveling in his triumph, sneered at Osborne. "Why aren't you running? Use that spatial power of yours! Ha! Theodore, did you think we'd be unprepared? Knowing you had spatial power, we made sure to find a way to counter them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This Supreme Origin Colossus has a remarkable power&mdash;anyone near it can't use spatial travel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, do you still think you can escape?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's derision echoed, and the surrounding warriors joined in his laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face darkened further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Supreme Origin Colossus? So that's what it's called?" he murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery sneered with contempt, saying, "Quite ignorant, aren't you? Haha, it's normal for you, a lowly Human Community member, not to know about the Supreme Origin Colossus! After all, it's a rare and extraordinary artifact found only among divine peaks. The Supreme Origin Colossus wields power beyond imagination. Not only does it prevent spatial travel, but it has many other incredible abilities! Even the Artisan Institute's creation of super divine artifacts draws its technology from this colossus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In short, the Supreme Origin Colossus is incredibly powerful and valuable. Our Paramount Supreme Clan has only managed to obtain three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, to deal with you, we've deployed one. You should be proud!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's face turned icy cold as he continued, "I don't waste my time with you anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, you're all going to die! With your spatial power disabled and us surrounding you, it's better to give up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he took steps towards Osborne, Hubery's voice was filled with menace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes were wide with amazement as he stared at the Supreme Origin Colossus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This Supreme Origin Colossus is actually so valuable? The Paramount Supreme Clan treats it as a super treasure? The Artisan Institute's Supreme Malevolence Sword and Shield, even the Supreme Sovereign's Armor, all their technologies are derived from this colossus?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hint of pain flashed in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had once possessed a Supreme Origin Colossus, but it had mysteriously disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I had known how precious it was, I would have taken much better care of it."</span></p><div class="pagination">
