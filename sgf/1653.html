  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside a massive structure at Divine Peak Nine, a hundred warriors congregated, summoned by command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere crackled with power, each warrior emanating a fierce and formidable presence. Judging by the emblems pinned to their chests, they were all leaders of at least ten thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each one was a Deity Overlord, with many in the late stages of this realm and a few even peaking at the pinnacle, proudly displaying insignias of the rank of brigadier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, they stood in attentive silence, waiting patiently for the arrival of Angelo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, Angelo made his entrance. To anyone observing, he appeared to be an ordinary old man, stripped of any noticeable divine power aura. There was no Divine Flame flickering above his head; aside from his bright eyes, he was as unremarkable as they came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, in the presence of this man, none dared to show any sliver of disrespect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the Vice Commander of the Wild Flame Army and the highest authority at the Divine Peak Nine base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, he was a Deity King warrior&mdash;a being truly standing at the pinnacle of Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any Deity King had the potential to forge an empire with their single strength, capable of utterly annihilating even the most substantial factions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For most practitioners, a Deity King was an untouchable supreme being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Angelo Royston!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Angelo Royston!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over a hundred Deity Overlords bowed respectfully as Angelo entered, regardless of whether they hailed from the Demonic Dragon Clan, the Soaring Lion Clan, or any other family or faction. At that moment, they all shared a deep reverence for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo smiled and waved a hand, saying, "No need for such formality."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, his gaze swept over the assembly, and in that instant, everyone felt as if their very souls were being pierced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A palpable tension gripped the room, and the faces of those gathered turned serious, eyes sharpened and wary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "I gathered you all here to discuss the mining of Celestial Crystals. I trust you're all aware of the significance of this endeavor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The heir of the Paramount Supreme Clan's Bowman family, Alfred Bowman, is currently at Wild Flame City's Royston family's place! He has suddenly sensed an opportunity to break through to Deity King, and to maximize his chances, he requires Celestial Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we can procure these crystals and deliver them to Alfred, we will not only bolster our standing with him but earn his gratitude as well. This will benefit us immensely, not just for our army but for both the Demonic Dragon Clan and the Soaring Lion Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thus, this mission must succeed at all costs! We will do whatever it takes to secure Celestial Crystals from the peak!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the mention of Celestial Crystals, the eyes of the warriors gleamed with a newfound determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rest assured, Mr. Angelo Royston, we will give it our all and ensure a successful acquisition of the Celestial Crystals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely! We're ready to lay down our lives in Divine Peak Nine if it means aiding you, Mr. Angelo Royston!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Count on us to go all out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chorus of voices echoed fervently through the hall as they eagerly expressed their loyalty to Angelo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a satisfied nod, he replied, "Excellent! If we succeed, I won't let you go unrewarded. The Essence Crystal vault of the Wild Flame Army will be opened to all of you. You'll have access to abundant Ultimate Essence Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, that's just the tip of the iceberg! There are even more rewards awaiting you! For instance&mdash;Miracle Elixirs! And should we acquire enough Celestial Crystals, each of you will have a shot at them too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mere mention of these rewards sent a wave of excitement through the crowd, their breaths quickening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though they were high-ranking members of the Wild Flame Army, acquiring Ultimate Essence Crystals was no easy feat for them. Just a mere hint of the prizes that awaited stirred a fervor in their hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With enough Ultimate Essence Crystals, their cultivation speed would skyrocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But compared to Miracle Elixirs and Celestial Crystals, the Ultimate Essence Crystals paled in significance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Miracle Elixirs and Celestial Crystals could enhance potential and even allow for direct breakthroughs in their realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These individuals, whose potential had been nearly exhausted, had resigned themselves to the fact that no matter how hard they pushed, their realms were capped for life&mdash;at least when it came to reaching the Deity King level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with Miracle Elixirs and Celestial Crystals, well, everything could change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The possibility of breaking through to the exalted realm of Deity King would no longer be a pipe dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could they not be thrilled?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, they were filled with eager anticipation for the exploration of Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, don't get too excited just yet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all know how dangerous Divine Peak Nine is. The Celestial Crystal mine we're after is deep within, about 60 thousand miles in. Even I don't have full confidence I'll make it out unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go back, prepare, and stock up on whatever might save your lives. We leave in six hours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved a hand dismissively, and the group dispersed, each person eager to gather their most precious life-saving items.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Six hours later, over a hundred Deity Overlord warriors regrouped, now joined by ten additional miners. Their mission was to protect these miners as they ventured into the Celestial Crystal mine to begin excavation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Good, everyone's here. Let's move out!" Angelo's command was crisp and final.</span></p><div class="pagination">
