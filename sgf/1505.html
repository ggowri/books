  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fast, but not faster than me!" Kerwin sneered, unflinching as Osborne's fist nearly grazed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flicker, he narrowly dodged the attack, his smirk intact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now you see, speed alone ain't nothing special. The Crimson Ironhoof Clan's speed outmatches yours! And without your speed advantage, what else have you got?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Against my Celestial Deity peak realm, you're just biding time till you're toast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, unfazed by his missed strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Kerwin couldn't dodge a single move, that would disappoint him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Biding my time? You overestimate yourself! If I can't beat you in three moves, you can have that manor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne launched another attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Judgment Thunder Drake!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deafening roar filled the air as a formidable bolt of lightning coalesced into a dragon, hurtling towards Kerwin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kerwin grinned coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three moves? Dream on! Now you'll see the vast gulf between us aside from speed. Get wrecked!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His divine power surged as he thrust a punch at Osborne's thunder dragon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's smirk widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Knew you'd fall for this! Literally suicidal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lightning elemental essence, at its peak Level Five, made Judgment Thunder Drake devastatingly powerful with a penetrative force that exploded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kerwin, treating it as ordinary, was signing his own doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kerwin's punch connected, but instead of shattering, the dragon pierced through his divine power defenses with terrifying force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crackling thunder made Kerwin's body tingle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that was just the start.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the dragon broke through his defenses and touched his Divine Body, it exploded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thunderous blast engulfed Kerwin, his screams echoing as his body stiffened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the shockwave subsided, Osborne moved again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He zipped to Kerwin's side lightning-fast. Kerwin tried to dodge but remained paralyzed by the dragon's electrical onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's grin widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lightning swirled around him, condensing into a smaller yet more intense dragon on his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a powerful punch, the force erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It sent Kerwin flying, blood gushing, his chest blackened with the smell of charred flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kerwin crashed to the ground, smoking and eyes dimming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers, including Betty, her siblings, Darren, the Keynes family youngsters, and Urban Development Exchange members, stared in shock at Kerwin's blackened, disfigured form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fight had spoken volumes&mdash;mess with Osborne, and the consequences are dire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers exchanged incredulous glances. They mused, "Is the fight over already? Kerwin's a peak Celestial Deity warrior, a chiliarch in the Wild Flame Army. Sure, he might not be the cream of the crop among peak Celestial Deity warriors, but he's definitely no pushover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And here he is, down for the count in just two moves by Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ridiculous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lachlan's just quick, right? He only recently broke through to the Celestial Deity realm. Shouldn't he be way behind Kerwin in every other aspect?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it had been Kerwin who had landed two blows and felled Osborne, it would have seemed par for the course.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Osborne to have done it to Kerwin? That was unthinkable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoa!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd collectively gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, unhurried, approached the prostrate Kerwin. He looked down at the utterly defeated Kerwin with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that it? You think you can challenge me with that measly talent? You dared to look down on me? You really had a death wish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne raised his foot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few young Keynes family members finally snapped out of their shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop it! Lachlan, you lowly Human Community dog, stop right now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you harm our uncle further, the Keynes family will come for you! So will the Crimson Ironhoof Clan! Think twice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Threatening me at a time like this? You're too accustomed to look down on people. Guess it's time you get properly schooled!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Osborne's foot connected with Kerwin's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sickening thud followed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kerwin's Divine Body shattered instantly, his divine power essence obliterated. His Divine Flame guttered out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kerwin was utterly crippled by Osborne.</span></p><div class="pagination">
