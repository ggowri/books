  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spatial power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad was shocked. Metahumans were extremely rare. In Dampston, it had been hundreds of years since one appeared. Seeing Osborne and Isaac emerge from a dimensional rift naturally left him astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his expression quickly changed. "No, the Augustine family wants to silence us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Brad swiftly grabbed Lauren's shoulder, and power surged around him as he prepared to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think you can escape?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered and waved his hand sharply in Brad's direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, several dimensional rifts appeared in front of Brad, blocking his escape route. Even as a Class A martial master, Brad didn't dare to collide with the dimensional rifts and quickly changed direction, frantically trying to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how he ran, numerous dimensional rifts appeared in front of him, blocking his way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sky seemed to shatter into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, all of Brad's escape routes were filled with countless dimensional rifts, forming a prison-like barrier around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This situation made Brad gasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face turned extremely grim. He finally stopped and turned to face Osborne and Isaac.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted angrily, "Isaac, what do you think you're doing? You dare to attack me? Does the Augustine family want to go to war with the Paltrow family? If a war breaks out, your family will be annihilated in no time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac snorted coldly without speaking and looked at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything depended on Osborne's decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly and glanced at Lauren, who was stealthily taking out her phone, seemingly trying to contact someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered and retrieved a signal jammer from the Dimensional Space with a wave of his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lauren's expression instantly turned serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head at Brad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad's face grew even darker. He shouted angrily, "Isaac, what are you trying to do? This is suicide. The Augustine family is courting death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we die near the Augustine Estate, the Paltrow family will know that it was the </span><span>Augustine family who killed us. Do you think blocking our messages will solve anything?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won't get away with this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly, "Brad, there's no need to shout. Even if you die here, the Paltrow family won't go to war with the Augustine family. Because no one will know that it was the Augustine family who killed you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad's face grew even darker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne calmly said, "I mean exactly what I said. You will die here by my hand. Your family will never know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because to them, the only one in the Augustine family capable of threatening you is Isaac, and there will be no traces of his involvement on this battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, there's no need for more words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He won't hurt you. If you can defeat me, you can leave here alive. If you can't beat me, then...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You will die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, Osborne took a few steps forward, filled with fighting spirit, and stared at Brad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad was furious when he heard this. "Kid, you're too arrogant. You think you can kill me just because you took a couple of my blows? Do you really think you can fight me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't even use half of my strength earlier. Since you want to die, I'll grant your wish."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad finished speaking and signaled Lauren to step back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? Then I'm looking forward to it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's gaze was fixed on Brad, his fighting spirit surging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad was a true Class A martial master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne absorbed the power of many blood diamonds, his physical capabilities seemed to have undergone some extraordinary transformation, becoming incredibly powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he hadn't yet broken through to Class A, Osborne felt that his physical prowess was no weaker than that of an ordinary Class A martial master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But whether this was an illusion or not, he would have to find out by fighting a real martial master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad was his touchstone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I can't even defeat Brad, how can I face Alexander? How can I get Clarissa back? So, I have to win this fight. Not only do I need to win, but I also can't use my power. I can only rely on my physical strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then can I be ready to fight Alexander."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne took the initiative to attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Relying solely on physical strength to fight a Class A martial master, Osborne dared not be careless. Without hesitation, he activated the Blood Cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vampire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrifying power erupted within Osborne's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hair grew wildly, instantly turning into long, flowing locks, each strand blood-red, like fresh blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two sharp fangs grew in his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fingers extended into long, dagger-like claws as sharp as knives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face became paler and more chiseled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne transformed into a Vampire. His speed and strength surged, powerful energy even oozing from his pores, enveloping his body in a faint blood-red aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body, like a cannonball, instantly appeared in front of Brad, his fist creating a sonic boom as it sped toward Brad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brad was shocked when he saw Osborne's Vampire transformation, but as a martial master with rich combat experience, he quickly regained his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing Osborne's attack, he didn't panic and met the blow with his own punch.</span></p><div class="pagination">
