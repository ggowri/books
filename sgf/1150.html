  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cillian and his siblings were feeling anxious. In Eidolon City, danger could strike at any moment, and they were itching to whisk Osborne away immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with Osborne's assurance, they had no choice but to wait.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, their impatience quickly faded when Osborne waved his hand, tearing open a massive rift in space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, he led them, along with over 48 hundred Blood Demon members, through interdimensional travel and straight into Newport City, right to the Augustine Estate's doorstep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer display of power left Cillian and his companions utterly speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne </span><span>felt</span><span> a sense of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strength had surged, and his mastery over spatial power had reached new heights. If he were traveling solo, he could easily cover over 600 miles in one jump.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the entire contingent of Blood Demons in tow, they could still traverse more than 200 miles in one go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The travel took a lot of energy</span><span>,</span><span> though.</span><span> </span><span>B</span><span>ut for Osborne, it was a drop in the bucket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy </span><span>in the planet </span><span>was so dense now that his recovery rate had skyrocketed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew he would replenish any lost energy in no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Wait here</span><span> for a sec!" he called out, motioning for someone to take care of Cillian and his siblings while he returned to the training base with the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he surveyed the 4</span><span>,</span><span>8</span><span>00</span><span> Blood Demons around him, Osborne</span><span> was weighing choices</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, they had slaughtered a staggering </span><span>500,000</span><span> </span><span>Ferocious Beasts, with over </span><span>50,000 </span><span>of them being Class A or higher Dark Exotic Beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Blood Cross was now brimming with </span><span>blood energy</span><span> from the dead beasts</span><span>, and he pondered how best to utilize it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could split this blood energy among all </span><span>Blood Demon members, giving each of them a boost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or</span><span> he</span><span> could</span><span> condense</span><span> it into just a hundred drops and let the Blood Demon Vanguard absorb it, </span><span>then they</span><span> </span><span>would</span><span> become top-tier Class S warriors!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should I share it among everyone or focus on elevating the Vanguard to the peak of Class S?" Osborne </span><span>couldn</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span>t decide for a while</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, he </span><span>chose</span><span> the latter. Boosting the Vanguard would provide a greater overall increase in the Blood Demon's fighting strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, Vanguard</span><span> stay</span><span>. The rest of you can head back and rest up," Osborne ordered, and the other members dispersed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, Osborne concentrated the blood energy from the Blood Cross into a hundred drops, ready for the Vanguard to absorb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they consumed the energy, their power began to surge dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Class S warriors came in various strengths</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>A</span><span> top-tier Class S could easily take down an ordinary Class S</span><span>, or even </span><span>five, six, or </span><span>ten ordinary Class S warriors</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the massive influx of blood energy, the hundred members of the Blood Demon Vanguard were rapidly breaking through to </span><span>top-tier </span><span>Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour later, every single one of them had absorbed the energy and reached the limit of Class S!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, their next step was to forge their Divine Bones and Fleshes, honing their unique </span><span>Divine Bodies to master divine power and ultimately transcend into true deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One hundred top-tier Class S warriors!" Osborne thought, a broad smile spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the Blood Demon members didn't have the best talents, certainly not when compared to the prodigies </span><span>from</span><span> superpowers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, since they had been transformed by Osborne using Blood Cross into Vampires, their progression had no bottlenecks, requiring only ample blood energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Consequently, the advancement rate of Blood Demon members far surpassed that of any so-called geniuses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, a hundred top-tier Class S warriors had emerged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, "Even the League of Divine Descent and the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization likely don't have many top-tier Class S warriors. It's too bad we can't take them out just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, let me ascend to godhood, quell the Beast Tide, and elevate all Blood Demon members to top-tier Class S, maybe even gods. Only then will we deal with them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne then prepared to head to Eidolon City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was particularly intrigued by the sudden rift spewing Dark Exotic Beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Osborne led a hundred members of the Blood Demon </span><span>Vanguard to </span><span>meet</span><span> with Cillian and his team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Vanguard members had toned down their auras to a mere Class AAA level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, a hundred top-tier Class S warriors could wipe out most superpowers; there was no need to reveal their full strength </span><span>too soon</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cillian and his group were overjoyed, though they thought Osborne's choice to take only Anastasia, Zoe, and a hundred Class AAA warriors to Eidolon City was too modest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, they dared not voice their concerns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, Osborne tore </span><span>through the</span><span> space, embarking on an interdimensional journey that spanned over 200 miles, depositing them near the Carey Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emerging from the dimensional rift, Osborne activated Satan's Eye, focusing on a direction where intense combat raged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a</span><span> colossal </span><span>canyon</span><span> at</span><span> the edge of the </span><span>Lostridge</span><span> Mountains within</span><span>.</span></p><div class="pagination">
