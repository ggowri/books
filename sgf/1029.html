  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's gaze was fixed on a spot six miles beneath the surface, where the waters lay calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no sign of battle, which only confirmed his worst fears: Bryce had been captured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce was alive but barely clinging to consciousness, his body battered and bruised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> intended to take him alive for some sinister purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, with sixty Class S clones surrounding him, there would be no way Bryce could've escaped&mdash;he'd have been dead long before now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Bryce was a Class S warrior, Osborne was confident that he could take Bryce down swiftly in a one-on-one fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, even with that certainty, Osborne had no illusions about facing sixty Class S clones at once. He knew that not even the Trident of Poseidon would give Bryce an edge in that kind of overwhelming situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least it's only sixty, not the hundred I was fearing," Osborne thought, his expression serious as tension gripped his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on, Osborne? How's my brother? Is he okay?" Kendra's anxious voice broke through his thoughts, her eyes filled with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath, trying to maintain calm. "Listen, don't freak out. The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> hasn't killed Bryce yet. He's alive but... they're planning to take him away alive. There are sixty Class S clones with him right now. They should be moving him soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sixty Class S!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra nearly stumbled back, her face turning pale with despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are we going to do? They're going to torture my brother! How could this happen? We have to do something!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said firmly, gripping her shoulders to steady her, "Hey, take a breath!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We still have a chance! I think they don't know we're here yet. That gives us an edge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I can't take you with me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You need to find a safe spot while I figure out how to rescue him. I can't risk your safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I'm gone for more than a day and still not back, head home without me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No heroics, understood?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra bit her lip, wrestling with the overwhelming fear churning inside her. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'll do what you say! But Osborne... you have to promise me you'll be careful. If... if you can't get Bryce back, don't put yourself in danger trying. I don't want to lose you, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her pain was clear, concerns flooding her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She desperately needed her brother saved, yet she didn't want to see Osborne jeopardize his life for a mission that might be hopeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it, I'll be cautious," Osborne replied, determined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly grabbed her hand and activated another interdimensional travel jump, taking them back 90 miles to a small island. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This should be safe enough for you to hide," Osborne said as they landed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given Kendra's Class AAA strength, she could stay safe as long as she didn't encounter the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever you do, stay put and don't draw attention to yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a last reassuring look, Osborne activated interdimensional travel again and shot 90 miles away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He emerged just 6 miles from Bryce's location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly cast his Satan's Eye ability, sharpening his focus on the sixty Class S clones, vigilant for any sign of weakness and waiting for the right moment to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt his heart race; he knew he had to tread carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was no small task&mdash;sixty Class S clones were no joke, and if they closed in on him, it would be game over. He needed a plan, and he needed it fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mused, "I either need to take out over ten Class S clones at one time, dropping their numbers below fifty, or I have to rescue Bryce first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Bryce's strength, he should be able to hold off ten or even twenty Class S clones for a short time. That would relieve some of the pressure on me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of taking down ten Class S clones in an instant felt daunting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recalled his last spar with his grandfather, where he had managed to eliminate only six before being forced to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Compared to that, saving Bryce seems like an easier choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His injuries are severe, but with the Light of Redemption, I can get him back to peak condition in no time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the challenge loomed large. Bryce was surrounded by sixty Class S clones, and getting in close enough to use the Light of Redemption wouldn't be easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pondered, "Maybe I can tackle both at once!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I can take out several Class S clones quickly, I could break their circle and create a path to Bryce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if I get swarmed while trying to reach him, and Bryce can't hold off the remaining clones, we're both done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne clenched his jaw, deep in thought, as he calculated the best approach. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Which Class S clones should I target first to maximize my chances of success and disrupt their circle?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze landed on eight Class S clones huddled together, their proximity offering a glimmer of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those are the ones! If I can take them down, I'll have a clear shot at Bryce. Plus, they're all Vampire Kings&mdash;my specialty!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a surge of confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew he could dispatch them more easily than the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is it! I'm going for it!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
