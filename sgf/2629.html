  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina said, "The Battle Points Monument on the ninth level can exchange for any resources, treasures, Sacred Artifacts, and achievements you can think of! Of course, the premise is that you have enough battle points."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, start redeeming on your own!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"An hour later, the staircase to the tenth level will disappear. We must enter the tenth level before that. So, whatever you want to redeem, make sure to finish within an hour."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Seraphina placed her hand on the Battle Points Monument. Instantly, a red glow emanated from the Monument, completely enveloping her, as if forming a cocoon, making her figure invisible to the outside world.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone else was astonished but quickly followed Seraphina's example, placing their hands on the Battle Points Monument. In an instant, red light burst forth, enveloping each person and forming individual red cocoons.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone began redeeming.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, the trials were getting increasingly difficult, and none of them were fully confident they could clear all the way to the eighteenth level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they didn't redeem now and got eliminated midway, their battle points would be wasted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Seraphina was redeeming something at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although she was confident in clearing all the way to the eighteenth level, she considered that she could earn more battle points after clearing and still redeem later.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, she chose to use these battle points to exchange for items that could enhance her strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While they were redeeming, Osborne and his group of four also arrived nearby.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara asked, "Are they using battle points to redeem something?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Ignore them for now. Let's complete the ninth level's trial first. After we pass, we'll check out what good items we can redeem."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he stepped into the beam of light.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina and the others were redeeming battle points, which didn't affect them starting the trial. Osborne easily defeated the warriors' projections of Primary Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For him now, this was too easy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even before his breakthrough, he could finish the fight in one breath, let alone now as an advanced Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, Clara and Leroy also defeated the warriors' projections in one breath, each earning one million battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Casey, however, took nearly five breaths to defeat the warriors' projections, earning only two hundred thousand battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, the battle points above Osborne, Clara, and Leroy's heads were all 3.3 million, while Casey's was exactly 2 million.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said, "Let's first see what treasures and resources these battle points can be exchanged for."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They also approached the Battle Points Monument, placed their hands on it, and were instantly enveloped in a red glow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne found himself in an independent space.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was completely empty&mdash;except for a warped shadow that vaguely resembled a tree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, a deep voice echoed in Osborne's mind. "Challenger, you have 3.3 million battle points. What would you like to exchange from me? You can tell me your needs."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stared at the twisted shadow in surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Is this thing actually alive?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this some kind of peculiar lifeform, or a power projection?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without thinking much, Osborne asked, "What level of weapon can my battle points exchange for?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne wanted to first understand the approximate value of over three million battle points to better proceed with the upcoming exchange.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"One million battle points can be exchanged for a high-quality Superior Sacred Artifact, and over three million battle points can be exchanged for three artifacts of the same quality," the deep voice sounded again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "One million battle points can only exchange for a decent Superior Sacred Artifact? That's way too low in value!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the Royal Treasury, one hundred million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints can exchange for a high-quality Superior Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In other words, one battle point is roughly equivalent to one hundred Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The 3.3 million battle points he owned were equivalent to over 300 million Kingdom Duel Scorepoints.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It's a considerable amount, but not particularly astonishing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At least for Osborne now, the items that these battle points can exchange for are far from satisfying him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the advantage of battle points over Kingdom Duel Scorepoints is that they can be used to exchange for almost anything, while Kingdom Duel Scorepoints can only be used to redeem Sacred Artifacts in the Royal Treasury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Rare items not found in the Royal Treasury cannot be exchanged, no matter how many Kingdom Duel Scorepoints one has.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne stared at the phantom and decided to ask further to gather more information. "What kind of existence are you? How should I address you? Here, can anything really be exchanged as long as there are enough battle points?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The voice replied, "I am the Artifact Soul of the Celestial Spire, essentially the soul of the Celestial Spire. You can call me Toby! However, keep in mind that not everything can be exchanged. If it's something I don't have, you won't be able to get it either."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But almost everything you can imagine is here. If I don't have it, then you definitely don't have enough battle points to exchange for it. So, your battle points can probably get you anything equivalent that you can imagine."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but feel a bit unconvinced after hearing that.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Toby has such an arrogant tone."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Everything I can imagine, he has? And the things he doesn't have, I can't even imagine?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a bit unconvinced at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked, "Really? Then can I exchange for a Perfect Dragon Elixir here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he looked at Toby provocatively.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby's words carried no emotional fluctuation. "The cosmos is vast, with countless items, and their names vary. So, please first clearly outline the shape and characteristics of the Perfect Dragon Elixir in your mind, and only then can I answer you accurately."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded and quickly began imagining in his mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So that's it!" Toby said calmly, "You can indeed exchange for the Perfect Dragon Elixir here. However, your battle points are far from enough."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne widened his eyes upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't believe that the Perfect Dragon Elixir could actually be exchanged.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hurriedly asked, "Then how many battle points are needed to exchange for a drop of Perfect Dragon Elixir?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby replied, "One billion battle points!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly did the math, then widened his eyes in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One billion battle points can only exchange for a drop of Perfect Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Based on the value of battle points, one hundred million battle points are enough to exchange for a high-quality Supreme Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And the price of Perfect Dragon Elixir is at least ten times, even dozens of times, that of a Supreme Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hiss!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt shocked. He currently only has 3.3 million battle points, still far from one billion battle points.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, he might still have a chance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "If I can keep completing the trials, I can continuously accumulate battle points. Maybe one billion battle points isn't impossible to achieve."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne continued to ask, "Can I exchange for an Imperial Artifact here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Toby listened and gave a faint smile. "An Imperial Artifact? Of course, it can be exchanged. The most basic Imperial Artifact only requires five billion battle points."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne widened his eyes again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't believe an Imperial Artifact was actually this cheap.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The price of five drops of Perfect Dragon Elixir can exchange for the most basic Imperial Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is equivalent to the price of fifty Supreme Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fifty Supreme Sacred Artifacts can be exchanged for one Imperial Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Probably everyone would choose to exchange without hesitation. Not just fifty, even five hundred or five thousand, someone would still be willing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For example, the Royal Treasury of the Glorious Divine Kingdom has at least over ten thousand Supreme Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the entire Glorious Divine Kingdom doesn't even have a single Imperial Artifact.</span></p><div class="pagination">
