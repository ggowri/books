  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mosley's body twisted and morphed in an instant, transforming back into the monstrous form of a giant mosquito. Its razor-sharp wings, resembling long blades, slashed towards Osborne's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die, my little treasure!" Mosley cried out with enthusiasm, her excitement palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massive blood energy emanating from Osborne was like an irresistible fragrance to her, causing her enormous form to quiver with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her eagerness didn't affect the deadly precision of her wing attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, refusing to be careless, summoned his martial art aura to shield himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp wings, akin to long knives, cleaved through the martial art aura, cutting a gash through it in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "My martial art aura is a fusion of Level Eight Devil's Light, known for its exceptional defense. Yet Mosley's wings sliced through it with such ease? If it had been fully cut through, I'd have had no choice but to retreat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne swung his Rock Smasher with force, aiming a heavy blow at Mosley's wings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deafening crash echoed as Osborne felt a sharp jolt through his hand, but Mosley's wings remained unmoved. Her massive eyes glinted with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had immense strength, having broken through to Class AAA and fused with the Powerstone. Compared to Cuthbert, his power was superior, and among Class AAA, few could rival him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, this colossal power, combined with the divine artifact Rock Smasher, seemed utterly ineffective against Mosley. Her body felt as impenetrable as the strongest metal, instilling a sense of hopelessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! How pathetic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mosley sneered, her wings moving like twin blades, slicing rapidly towards Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no choice but to dodge with quick reflexes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, two long slashes appeared where Osborne had been standing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Think you can escape?" Mosley taunted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her wings were not the only threat. Her long, serrated legs began attacking as well, moving swiftly towards Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sweeping strikes from her wings and legs cut through everything in their path, creating a terrifying spectacle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could only dodge desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Mosley's speed increased, evading her became increasingly difficult for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This can't go on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a determined grimace, Osborne stopped his evasive maneuvers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gripping the Volt Hammer tightly with his left hand, he raised it high above his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying bolt of lightning erupted from the hammer, crashing down towards Mosley's massive form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Osborne's shock, Mosley's wings moved to meet the lightning head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lightning was sliced and shattered by Mosley's wings, disappearing without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "The Thundergod Gloves I'm wearing, combined with the Volt Hammer's power, should be top-tier, even among top-grade divine artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Mosley just swatted it away?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of monster is she?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is this really just a Class S?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pressure Mosley exerted on Osborne was far greater than that of Marvin, another Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grinding his teeth, Osborne continued to channel the power of the Volt Hammer, unleashing wave after wave of devastating lightning bolts at Mosley's colossal form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mosley's gaze was cold and piercing as she continued to slice through the descending lightning bolts with her wings, shattering them with effortless precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were filled with mockery and disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your power is impressive. Even though you're no more than a Lesser God, your attacks are formidable. But unfortunately, they are pointless against me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am the great deity Mosley. Even if my strength has waned to the level of a mere Lesser God, I am still untouchable by mere mortals like you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop wasting your energy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To a being like her, anyone not at the Class S Lesser God level, whether a mere human or even a Class AAA metahuman, was just a mortal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could a mere mortal possibly hurt a deity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face grew grim as he thought, "The Thundergod Gloves and Volt Hammer are my most powerful weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they can't harm Mosley, what can I do? Should I retreat?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But seeing Kendra and Yulissa, who were unconscious not far away, Osborne discarded the idea of fleeing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "No, I can't run! If I flee, Kendra and Yulissa are as good as dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mosley would pierce them with her dreadful mouthpart and drain their blood."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here goes everything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With clenched teeth, Osborne recalled the words of the God of Star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The reason they're called Dark Deities is not only because they seek to enslave the world but also because their very essence is evil, countered only by the power of holy light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Therefore, your Light Power will suppress them to some extent. Otherwise, with your current strength, I wouldn't let you face them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Light Realm!" Osborne roared, and in an instant, the Light Realm erupted around him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
