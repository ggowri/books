  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hush fell over the arena like a thick blanket, a strange calm that took everyone by surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lively buzz around the stage turned into a collective gasp as onlookers gaped at Diana. She'd easily taken a hit from the Wooden Golem and, in a split-second, sent it crashing to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One punch&mdash;that was all it took.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their eyes, the once-fearsome Wooden Golem now seemed like a total pushover in front of Diana, more like a figment of the imagination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what seemed like ages, the chatter started up again, getting louder and more excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Something </span><span>ain't</span><span> right! How could the Wooden Golem be this </span><span>weak</span><span>? These things have been used for training loads of times. You just fork out some Celestial Crystals, and they're good to go..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, a bunch of inner disciples have used them. They've really struggled, and couldn't withstand the Golem's attacks, let alone break through its defenses. And now, this? What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the three guys in Terrance's group looked really glum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get another Wooden Golem! This one's </span><span>gotta</span><span> be a dud!" Terrance ground his teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamaal nodded in agreement. "It might seem okay on the outside, but there's definitely something screwy with its programming!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I grabbed three Golems from the warehouse this time. Each one was from Ms. Olsen's first batch. They're supposed to be way tougher than the rest! I just can't believe all three are acting up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fired up, Jamaal took off running towards the arena, set on swapping out the faulty Golem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look! Jamaal's swapping the Wooden Golem! I said before that the last one had to be busted! How else could some hick from a small life-bearing planet take it down with one punch?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bet! There had to be a problem! With the new Golem, there's no way they'll pull that off again. This time, they're done for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the crowd murmured with wild guesses, Terrance started to feel a bit more at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, Maddox couldn't hold back and let out a scoff. After seeing what Bryce and Diana were capable of, he was brimming with confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Check it out! Anyone who's pals with Osborne </span><span style="font-style: italic;">is</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> bound to be a powerhouse, not your run-of-the-mill folks! I was worried they wouldn't pass the assessment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox shot a look at Terrance and said, "So you think the Wooden Golem's the problem? That's a riot! Just wait till you see how stupid you look later!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrance's face clouded over. "Hmph! What's so funny? Just you wait! Things won't be a walk in the park for you guys from now on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox said, brushing it off, "Really? We'll just have to see! I can't wait to wipe that smug look off your face."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, someone stepped onto the stage&mdash;it was Hannah!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah, also at Ascension Three, got into position. The Wooden Golem sized her up and then launched a full-on attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without saying a word, Hannah tapped into her powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As someone who could wield both life and dark powers, she decided to go with her dark power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The new Wooden Golem went flying again and hit the ground hard, unable to get back up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah stepped out of the ring without a peep, her awesomeness low-key but undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now they knew how strong the Golems really were. Even though their powers outshone those of the top talents from the Paramount Supreme Clan at the same cultivation level, these Golems were still a tough nut to crack, and losing was a real risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with their already huge abilities given an extra boost by the Element Gold Crystal and Sacred Crystal, they'd come to see that the Golems were no match for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Wooden Golem of the same cultivation level? Hardly a challenge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even geniuses with a cultivation level one or two tiers above would find it difficult to hold their ground against Osborne's companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were simply that strong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, the crowd gathered around the arena was left </span><span>gobsmacked</span><span>. Those who'd been so sure that swapping out the Wooden Golem would turn the tables felt like they'd just been given a reality check, a stinging slap in the face. They clammed up, not daring to utter a single word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They weren't stupid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was crystal-clear now that the Golem was in perfect working order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The real game-changers were the fighters in the ring&mdash;Bryce, Diana, and Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their raw power at Ascension Three far exceeded all expectations, allowing them to knock out the Ascension Three Wooden Golem with a single punch each.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They effortlessly defeated their opponents, leaving the onlookers initially shocked and then speechless as the scene unfolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Kendra, Mila, Zoe, and Anastasia took their turns, with Zoe, already at Ascension Four, leading the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the other three were still at Ascension Three, regardless of their cultivation levels, they all dispatched the Wooden Golem with a single, effortless strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, the Golem went flying, hitting the ground and struggling to rise, looking so pitiful that it had become little more than a punching bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It left everyone utterly silent, their eyes wide in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrance and his mates went from mere spectators to hopefuls, only to be plunged into disappointment and finally fall silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first skeptical that the Wooden Golem was broken, they quickly grasped that the problem wasn't the Golem at all; it was that Osborne's gang was just way too powerful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them boasted incredible fighting skills, making the Wooden Golem look like a pushover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrance loathed to admit it, but he had no option as the truth ate away at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't shake the annoyance of knowing that Maddox had recruited these folks into Peak Seven's inner circle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stronger they got, the more it ticked him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, right then, he didn't dare voice his complaints or rile them up more because the Elders of Peak Seven had shown up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After watching Bryce, Diana, and the rest effortlessly take down the Wooden Golems, the Elders started paying attention, huddling together to quietly watch the action in the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Anastasia, having reached Ascension Four, also flattened the Golem with a single strike, the Elders' eyes sparkled with excitement, and they whispered to each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes were glued to Bryce, Diana, and the others, brimming with eagerness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This dawned on Terrance like a bolt from the blue&mdash;the Elders were into Osborne's gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They might even want to take Osborne's gang under their wings as disciples!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!" Terrance gritted his teeth, trying to hold back his mounting annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, he'd set out to undermine Maddox and stop Osborne's gang from waltzing into Peak Seven as inner disciples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his meddling had backfired, turning into a platform that showed off their skills and caught the Elders' eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, the Elders were probably eyeing them as future prot&eacute;g&eacute;s.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If any of them became the elders' disciples, their status and clout would shoot through the roof. Even someone like him would have to think long and hard before picking a fight with them in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like he'd pulled a major blunder on himself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, Maddox couldn't resist showing off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shot Terrance a scornful look and sneered. "So, still full of yourself, Terrance? We've got five more candidates queued up for the practical tests! You up for more?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrance's temper flared up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">More tests?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It'll just give them more chances to show off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm </span><span>outta</span><span> here!" he barked, getting ready to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, a powerful voice boomed, "Let's keep the assessments going! The ones who just fought really impressed me, but I'm itching to see what the other five can do. If they shine, I might just take them as my own disciples..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone went dead silent, too shocked to say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Olsen?!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
