  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin looked at Osborne with a cold, surprised expression.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmph! The Rosenthal family's divine artifact&mdash;the Swallow Shield? The Aberrants' divine artifact&mdash;the Axe of Strength? And the Volt Hammer, a divine artifact from my own family?" Marvin's eyes narrowed as he took in the sight of the three divine artifacts. "I'm truly amazed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You think these three artifacts will help you fight me? You're gravely mistaken. You have no idea just how vast the power gap is between Class AAA and Class S.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if you had ten divine artifacts, it wouldn't make a difference. You simply can't unleash their full power, and against me, they're meaningless!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Marvin began to advance towards Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I won't kill you quickly. I intend to savor your suffering, shattering every bone in your body, flaying you alive, and turning your flesh into ash!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin's voice was icy, his intent clear.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne felt a wave of dread as Marvin approached, like facing a towering tsunami of thousand feet.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The feeling of insignificance was overwhelming.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A surge of fear hit him. He thought, "I can't win this!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Facing a Class S Supreme Overlord feels like battling a god!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could a mere mortal stand against a deity?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Marvin drew closer, Osborne's resolve wavered, and he was tempted to drop his weapons and surrender.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His body trembled with fear.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He bit down hard on his lip, using the pain to clear his mind of doubt.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne thought, "Even if I can't win, I have to fight!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if it means death, I'll fight!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, Osborne struck, swinging the Volt Hammer with all his might. A terrifying bolt of lightning shot out, aimed straight at Marvin.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin's expression grew even colder. "You dare attack me? Too bad I've already said. Attacks of this level are pointless against me!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a casual wave of his hand, Marvin shattered the lightning bolt before it could even reach him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sparks of electricity danced harmlessly around him, with no effect whatsoever.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unperturbed, Marvin continued his steady advance towards Osborne, intensifying the pressure on him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne gritted his teeth. "Again!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He swung the Volt Hammer once more, unleashing an even more fearsome bolt of lightning. Yet again, Marvin merely waved his hand, and the lightning disintegrated on impact.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin walked through the remnants of the shattered lightning unscathed.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was stunned.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "Is this the true power of a Class S Supreme Overlord? Even with the Volt Hammer, which would overwhelm someone like Cuthbert who ranked among the top fifty on the Godson Rankings!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin just swatted my attack away with ease!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He's incredibly strong!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's body trembled, whether from fear or adrenaline, he couldn't tell.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin taunted from a distance of a hundred yards, motioning for Osborne to come forward.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Come on, give me your best shot! Show me everything you've got! I want you to understand just how huge the gap between us really is."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne snorted in defiance.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If that's the case, then watch this!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, he swiftly sheathed the Volt Hammer and gripped the Axe of Strength with both hands.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Vampire Transformation!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He roared, and the Blood Cross within his heart erupted with terrifying power, flooding every cell in his body and transforming him rapidly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His hair surged wildly, transforming into a flowing crimson mane that stretched an astonishing one hundred yards, moving as if it were blood itself, undulating in a phantom breeze.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Two sharp fangs erupted from his mouth, glistening with a predatory sheen.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His fingers elongated, growing into wickedly sharp nails like daggers, while his face became pale and angular, giving him a more feral appearance.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Breath of the Celestial!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne inhaled deeply, drawing in the air from a radius of hundreds of yards around him. Every cell in his body surged with newfound energy, igniting with vitality.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Osborne felt his strength peak.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Having already fused with the Powerstone and transcended to Class AAA, he had become terrifying. Now, with the Vampire Transformation amplifying his abilities at least twofold, the fourth tier of the Breath of the Celestial added another eighty percent to his might.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gripping the Axe of Strength, Osborne felt invincible.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A terrifying force roiled within him, like a volcano ready to erupt.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin could hardly hide his surprise. "You've got quite the bag of tricks! But tell me, what good will they do you?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne let out a derisive snort. "You'll find out soon enough!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, he raised the Axe of Strength high above his head. A surge of dark energy exploded from it, swirling ominously.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mountain Splitter!" Osborne roared, bringing the Axe of Strength crashing down with a ferocity that echoed across the battlefield.</p><div class="pagination">
