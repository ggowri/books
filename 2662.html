  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the moment of killing the bull with the Bloodwrought Bow, Osborne felt as if a current surged through his body, instantly activating every cell and causing his body to tremble involuntarily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's face showed utter shock. Then, he became extremely excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's wrong? What's wrong? What happened to you?" Primordial was startled by Osborne's expression, thinking something was wrong with him, and said anxiously, "Why did you attack that bull? It's just a power projection, not real. Even if you kill it, it will soon reappear in the cycle."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial felt a bit speechless. "Why did you attack it? Is something wrong with your body now?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He merged with Osborne's Soul Current Ocean. Moreover, he rooted himself in Osborne's Soul Current Ocean, and as Osborne's strength and Soul Current Ocean grew stronger, he would also become increasingly powerful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But likewise, if Osborne has a problem, he will too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he thought Osborne was in trouble and was very anxious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial anxiously pressed, "What's wrong with you? Tell me! I'll help you figure it out."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the excited and worried Primordial, Osborne took a deep breath. "I'm fine. No! I'm not fine!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked very serious, but his eyes were full of excitement. "Primordial, I might know what the opportunity in the Eighth Skyfall Casket is. I might know how to quickly enhance strength in the Eighth Skyfall Casket."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial was stunned. "What does this mean?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly recounted what had just happened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said in shock, "What? After you killed that bull, a strange power surged into your body, and this power enhanced your strength?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded firmly. "Exactly. After killing that bull, my strength increased. Although it's not very obvious, it's much faster than cultivating on my own. I feel like if I kill a few hundred of those creatures, I can break through advanced Empyrean Sacredness and reach Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Primordial's eyes widened instantly. "Really?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded. "I'll prove whether it's true or not. But did you notice that after I killed that bull, it didn't reappear? The battle there has already cycled, but the bull is gone."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial observed carefully.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A few minutes later, the battle cycled again, but the bull's projection indeed did not reappear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It really disappeared?" Primordial was a bit surprised, unable to figure out why.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the battle, after being killed by other creatures, the bull would reappear with the cycle. However, after being killed by Osborne, it completely vanished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said excitedly, "Quick! Try again! The creatures here are all at Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness, and they're no weaker than someone like Frederick at Sovereign Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness. With your strength, it's impossible for you to kill them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But you can deliver the final blow after they've been heavily injured by other creatures. My guess is, as long as you land the final hit, it counts as your kill. That way, you can reap the benefits."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, he looked into the distance. There, another bull was fighting with an Elf Race warrior. According to the cycle's pattern, the bull and the Elf Race warrior would soon be injured simultaneously and eventually killed together by a Bug Clan creature at Imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the bull and the Elf Race warrior were already injured simultaneously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I choose you!" Osborne drew the Bloodwrought Bow once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, since he had already used Heaven Arrow earlier and the cooldown time hadn't ended, he could only use the most powerful Arrow Storm from Earth Arrow at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, its power was sufficient.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the Sacred Power Arrow shot out, piercing through the heavily injured bull and killing it completely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, Osborne's body trembled again. He once more felt an inexplicable force rushing into his body from the bull's projection, as if he had absorbed the bull's power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt his strength increase once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No problem!" Osborne felt extremely delighted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He previously thought his strength had increased, and it wasn't an illusion. On this Ancient Battlefield, as long as he killed these creatures, he could enhance his power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then what are you waiting for? Kill them quickly!" Primordial was also very excited.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The stronger Osborne became, the more benefits he could gain, the faster his strength would grow, and the stronger he would become.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial excitedly said, "Killing the astral projections on this Ancient Battlefield will grant you power. If... if you can kill all the projected creatures here, you can easily become a warrior at the Imperial Empyrean Sacredness level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes. "Are you dreaming? With my current strength, even if I use the Bloodwrought Bow to unleash the strongest Heaven Arrow, I can at most deal with these astral projections at the Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness level. And I have to wait until they're seriously injured before making a move. Only then do I have a chance to kill them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As for those astral projections at the Imperial Empyrean Sacredness level, my attacks can't even break their defenses. Even if they're seriously injured and on the verge of death, I still can't kill them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Primordial calmed down. "Even so, that's not bad. There are so many astral projections at the Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness level here. If you kill them all, you'll easily reach Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection or Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection. You might even reach Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Within the range of his Satan's Eye vision, battles were happening everywhere. At least tens of thousands of astral projections at the Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness level were engaged in combat.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt that he only needed to take down a hundred astral projections at the Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness level to break through advanced Empyrean Sacredness and reach Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he killed all the astral projections at the Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness level within his vision, he might even have a chance to reach Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What's more, beyond the range of his Satan's Eye, there were even more astral projections.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was extremely excited. "This is a golden opportunity. I absolutely can't miss it. Otherwise, it will take me years, decades, or even longer to break through my cultivation level. Kill them!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His heart was filled with battle intent. After all, these creatures around him were just projections, not real beings. He didn't need to feel any psychological pressure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne took action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His Satan's Eye locked onto the heavily injured astral projections. Before they could escape, he swiftly shot Sacred Power Arrows, killing them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Streams of power surged into Osborne's body, rapidly boosting his cultivation level. He was already close to reaching Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection. After killing dozens of astral projections, he could feel the bottleneck of a breakthrough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Osborne's talent, such a bottleneck was easily overcome.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon after, when Osborne killed the 108th astral projection, his energy suddenly erupted, becoming stronger, sharper, and more refined than before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He finally broke through his cultivation level, reaching Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection!</span></p><div class="pagination">
