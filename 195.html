  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Chevalier, we should definitely work together more in the future. If my family needs security services, we'll definitely be coming to you. Don't forget to give us a good deal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Chevalier, I was on the fence about hiring either Skyefall Security or Chevalier Security for my daughter's bodyguards. Now it's a no-brainer. Chevalier Security is the choice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From tonight on, Chevalier Security is clearly the top security firm in Skyefall."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Chevalier..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Chevalier Security's team showcased their invisibility powers, everyone knew Skyefall Security was in serious trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elite of Skyefall were quickly flattering Derek and discussing potential deals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek was reveling in the praise, his pride evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, my son Apollo is in charge of Chevalier Security. If you're interested in working with us, talk to Apollo, and he'll make sure you get a fantastic deal," Derek said, glowing with satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apollo is something else! He's just come back from abroad and has already knocked Skyefall Security off its pedestal. What a standout talent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly. My son looks like a mere shadow by comparison. I hope he can learn something from Apollo. Even just a fraction of his skill would be a win."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a pity Apollo is engaged to the Radcliffe family's daughter. Otherwise, I would have introduced my daughter to him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apollo truly is the brightest star of our younger generation..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're telling me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The top families couldn't stop showering Apollo with praise, lifting him to almost legendary status, and Derek soaked up the admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone on the viewing platform heard the enthusiastic compliments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the Radcliffe family tried to stay composed, it was clear they weren't entirely happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, not everyone was impressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyefall was home to seven prestigious families, and the rivalry among them ran deep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Chevalier family's invitation to this contest was more about flaunting Apollo's skills than fostering goodwill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Representatives from these families were beginning to fume, especially the Lark family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion Lark, a strikingly handsome man in his mid-twenties and the Lark family's heir, was particularly annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saw himself as Apollo's equal. Fifteen years ago, when the Lark family proposed a marriage alliance with the Radcliffe family for him to wed Clarissa, the Radcliffe family chose Apollo instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion's frustration was only intensified by Clarissa's rising fame as the most beautiful woman in Mayby City and Skyefall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, she should have been his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the elite representatives were heaping praise on Apollo, crowning him as the most formidable young talent in Skyefall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa stood silently beside them, her lack of rebuttal only fueling Orion's frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a scowl, Orion snorted, "Are you all getting ahead of yourselves? So what if they have invisibility powers? It's not the end of the world. Chevalier Security hasn't won yet, and neither has Apollo!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words immediately brought a hush over the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek turned his gaze towards Orion, a smile tugging at his lips. "Orion, are you suggesting that Skyefall Security has some counter-strategy? Do you think they can turn this around?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion, wary of crossing the line with Derek, tried to maintain his composure. "I don't know if Skyefall Security can win, but I'm sure they won't give up easily. After all, they were once the top security firm. They must have some tricks up their sleeves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to say, I'm a bit concerned for you. You let Apollo take such a big risk personally. If anything happens to him, it'll be too late to regret it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek chuckled softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't need to worry about that. My son is not like you, living a cushy life. He's been through countless battles. This little risk is nothing to him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion bristled at the implication that he was less capable than Apollo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph, if Apollo ends up getting taken out, let's see how long you keep that smile!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And if he dies, his engagement to Clarissa is off. I wouldn't mind stepping in for that alliance myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then glanced at Clarissa, but she was too absorbed in watching the canyon to pay him any mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face showed a flicker of concern, which only made Orion angrier, thinking she must be worried about Apollo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn woman. Once Apollo is out of the picture, I'll make sure to take you for myself!" Orion thought bitterly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the calm of the canyon was shattered by the sudden, sharp crackle of gunfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fierce battle had finally begun.</span></p><div class="pagination">
