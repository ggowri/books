  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three factions all came to the same conclusion: to first unite and obliterate Rosmandi's Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their eyes, the Augustine family was the weakest of all the dominant forces on the Blue Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, to ensure absolute success, they decided to join forces, leaving no room for error. Their plan was to swiftly eliminate the Augustine family before turning their attention to the Lord League and the Prophet Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbeknownst to them, Osborne had overheard every bit of their plotting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His anger was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had initially thought that the Pantheon League and the Eityreia Organization were merely negotiating with the Dark Deities, maybe forming a temporary alliance. Though it was a betrayal of humanity, it could be understood as a move for survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the truth was far more sinister: the Pantheon League and Eityreia Organization were submitting to the Dark Deities and aligning with Lord Malevolence of Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were even prepared to betray human resistance forces to gain territory in Celestara, providing intelligence to the Dark Deity Legion and even assassinating key figures in the resistance movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was beyond mere betrayal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Pantheon League and Eityreia Organization deserve to be obliterated!" Osborne fumed, his eyes burning with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a surge of relief that he had stumbled upon their conspiracy in time. If Dark Deity, Pantheon League, and Eityreia Organization were left to execute their plan against the Augustine family, the outcome would be disastrous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if the Augustine family survived, they would suffer heavy losses, with many casualties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, armed with foresight, Osborne was determined to thwart their plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do they really think the Augustine family is the weakest on the Blue Planet? Ha! They're working with outdated information. If that's the case, perhaps I can set a trap for them before taking down the Pantheon League."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nelson and Emperor Dare had already left the cave to make their preparations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three factions had agreed to launch an all-out assault on the Augustine family in three days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated momentarily but decided to follow Emperor Dare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a Transcendent Deity warrior at his peak, Emperor Dare held a significant position within the Eityreia Organization. Tracking him would likely reveal their hideout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Eityreia Organization had concealed themselves even better than the Pantheon League, and Osborne was eager to pinpoint their location. Having already identified the Pantheon League's base, locating Eityreia's would make it easier to eventually eradicate them both.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Osborne witnessed Emperor Dare and his companions arrive at another major city in Marcelin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They descended into the depths of the city and then vanished from sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback. "Another Dimensional Microcosm?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When did these become so commonplace? The Pantheon League has one, and so does the Eityreia Organization!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, without such protection, they might not have survived this long."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these thoughts, Osborne left a trace of spatial energy on the Eityreia Organization's Dimensional Microcosm vessel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This would allow him to easily locate it in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time to head back and prepare," he murmured to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having completed his task without alerting the Eityreia Organization, Osborne swiftly retreated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, he was back at the Augustine Bastion, calling a meeting with the Augustine family's leadership.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He relayed his discoveries, and the room filled with a tense, angry silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, several leaders erupted in outrage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Pantheon League and Eityreia Organization have actually submitted to the Dark Deity? They've become Lord Malevolence's lackeys? This is a betrayal of humanity&mdash;they deserve nothing but condemnation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lord Malevolence destroyed their homes, and instead of seeking vengeance, they choose subjugation? They have no backbone. What a disgrace!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian interjected with a frown, "Enough! Now is not the time for this. In three days, the Dark Deity, Pantheon League, and Eityreia Organization will attack us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We need a plan to counter them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning to Osborne, Sebastian asked, "What's your assessment of these three forces? Can we withstand them with our current strength?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pondered the question, his expression serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their knowledge of our capabilities is limited, so they've underestimated us. Yet, they're overly cautious. Despite assuming we're the underdogs, they're all in for a full-force assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From what I've seen, the Dark Deity alone boasts at least fifty Transcendent Deity warriors and over two hundred Superior Deities&mdash;two or three times the strength of the Deschanel Clan!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And that's just the Dark Deity. I haven't been inside the Pantheon League or Eityreia Organization's Dimensional Microcosms, but their power likely rivals the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three days from now, we may be facing over a hundred Transcendent Deities and several hundred Superior Deities."</span></p><div class="pagination">
