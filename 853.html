  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the heart of Tethynia, the Aberrants' headquarters resembled a vast ant colony buried deep underground. Figures flitted through the corridors, their movements mechanical and purposeful.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A tall, imposing man stood there, gazing through a massive glass window at the grotesque carcass on the other side.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The creature was a Tauren&mdash;its enormous horns and bull-like head a stark contrast to its human body.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This particular Tauren was colossal, standing over 65 feet tall, its eyes closed in death. Despite its lifelessness, a faint aura of divine power still emanated from its body.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Aniston."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The towering figure turned, revealing a menacing devil mask.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The eyes behind it glowed a chilling red.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was Gerardo Aniston, the King of the Aberrants.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Entering was his chief disciple, George.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">George bowed respectfully. "Mr. Aniston, we couldn't locate Sebastian. He's vanished into the sea, and despite my efforts, I haven't been able to track him down."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gerardo remained unmoved. "If he's out of reach, then so be it.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After all, he's the Godfather of Rosmandi and someone who once defeated me. Even injured, he's not someone you can easily capture.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"However, he's been wounded by my divine power. It will take him at least a year or two to fully recover. By the time he's back to his old self, our plans will have long been completed."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A cold smile spread across his face.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sebastian, you once expelled me from Rosmandi. Now I'm returning, and there's nothing you can do to stop me."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">George grinned, saying, "You're right, Mr. Aniston. That Godfather is no match for you. Even if he recovers quickly, he'll still be no match for you."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet George's expression grew hesitant.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gerardo noticed, saying, "George, if you have something to say, just say it. You're my most trusted ally. Don't start being indecisive now."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">George quickly bowed again. "I apologize. I've come across some news that I wasn't sure whether to share, which is why I hesitated."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What news?" Gerardo asked, his interest piqued.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">George hurriedly replied, "The Augustine family has sent out invitations for an Honor Quest Ceremony for their first heir, Osborne. It's scheduled for two weeks from now."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gerardo froze.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne? The same Osborne who's thwarted my plans multiple times? I remember him as only Class AA. Although he's grown rapidly and even recently killed many of my 'hound dogs,' including your sixth disciple, Luca, holding an Honor Quest Ceremony with his level of power seems like a joke."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gerardo frowned in suspicion.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">George continued, "I thought the same. It's strange that Osborne, who isn't even on the Godson Rankings, is being given such an event.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is the Augustine family plotting something?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gerardo's frown deepened. "It does seem fishy. But whatever their scheme, it will be meaningless against our absolute power.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Send Bradley Fleming and Felicity Aniston to Rosmandi to find out what the Augustine family is up to. If there's a chance, eliminate Osborne and ruin the Honor Quest Ceremony.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Augustine family's Honor Quest Ceremony for Osborne must have been Sebastian's idea. Sebastian wouldn't have become Rosmandi's Godfather without some serious tricks up his sleeve. If he's so invested in Osborne, then I'll crush Osborne and shatter Sebastian's hopes once and for all!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A chilling resolve gleamed in Aniston's eyes.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Also, make sure they bring the Number Six Elixir."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Number Six Elixir?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">George's surprise was palpable. "Mr. Aniston, with Bradley, ranked 46th on the Godson Rankings, and Felicity ranked 128th, they should handle Osborne easily. There's no need to waste the Number Six Elixir on him, is there?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Number Six Elixir boosts their power threefold. It's a rare extract from the Minotaur's corpse, and using it on Osborne feels like overkill."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gerardo's smile was faint but cold. "It's fine. As long as we take down Osborne, wasting a couple of Number Six Elixirs isn't an issue. Also, have Medusa come along."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Medusa?!" George's astonishment was evident. "Mr. Aniston, have you managed to clone a Class S Medusa?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gerardo shook his head. "Not quite. The latest Medusa clone is still a work in progress&mdash;close to Class S but not there yet. Within a month, I'll be able to produce a large number of Medusas, Titan Kings, and Wolf Kings...</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then, it will be time for our return to Rosmandi!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And when that time comes, anyone who dares stand in our way will be destroyed!"</p><div class="pagination">
