  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a surge of determination, Osborne could no longer suppress the killing intent boiling within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He turned to Diana, his voice steady but urgent. "Diana, is there any way to send a message back to the base from here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana immediately stepped in front of him, instinctively protecting him from any potential attack from Emmett. Her expression was one of confusion as she processed his question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No, we can't! There's a strong special energy field near Divine Peak Nine. Any communication devices are useless within a thousand miles of it! We're only about 60 miles away, so there's no way to send a message back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As she spoke, Emmett couldn't help but chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at Osborne with a sneer. "What's the matter? You hoping to call for backup? Want to tattle on me? Ha! Too bad you're in a dead zone for messages! Even if we killed you right here, no one would ever know!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His voice dripped with malice, and the threat in his eyes grew more intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana shot back, her voice fierce. "Emmett, if you dare to kill him, I swear I'll fight you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emmett laughed coldly. "Diana, do you really think you can keep threatening me? I've held off on dealing with you only because you've been useful to me. I need you to help me mine Ultimate Essence Crystals to level up and become a Deity Overlord faster! But now, I'm about to reach the rank of brigadier-level miner!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I need to head to Divine Peak Nine to mine Celestial Crystals, and you, the cursed one, can't even set foot there! Anyone who goes with you is just asking for death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Plus, with my imminent breakthrough to Deity Overlord, you're becoming less and less important to me. Killing you wouldn't even be a setback!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There are plenty of lowly Human Community miners around; if I off you, I can just grab another one&mdash;maybe one that'll actually listen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So if you try to stop me today, I'll take you out too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His icy words sent a chill through the air, and Diana's face paled as panic flickered in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Y... You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She bit her lip, then suddenly pleaded, "Mr. Emmett Huntington, considering how long I've helped you, can't you spare Osborne? If you let him go, I promise that every Essence Crystal I mine will have a share for you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're on the brink of becoming a Deity Overlord, and you'll need all the Ultimate Essence Crystals you can get. Please, just let him go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At her words, Emmett burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, weren't you just so full of yourself? Now you're begging for this guy? Ha! You've really got it bad for him, don't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His eyes were filled with contempt and fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You want me to spare him? That could be arranged! Just become my woman and keep me happy, and I might let him live! Otherwise, he's as good as dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's anger flared, and she clenched her fists tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Emmett, you're despicable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Looks like you're not interested, huh? No problem! I'll kill him first, and then I'll deal with you! Whether you like it or not, I'll have you beneath me, and I'll enjoy every second of it! Honestly, I've been wanting to do this for a while; I just held back because you were still useful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He turned his gaze back to Osborne, a cruel smile spreading across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, lowly Human Community scum, how do you want to die?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he listened to the exchange, Osborne's own killing intent surged to the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gently pulled Diana behind him, a mocking smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana, step back for a moment. I wouldn't want your pretty clothes to get stained with his blood."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's eyes widened in disbelief as she stared at Osborne, clearly shocked by his defiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Emmett, taken aback for a moment, quickly regained his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You dare to talk back when your death is imminent? Fine, if that's how you want it, I'll be glad to oblige! Let's see whose blood ends up on the floor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he unleashed a surge of divine power, the air around him crackling with intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You all stay back and keep Diana out of my way! This lowly Human Community fool is nothing but a beginner Celestial Deity, yet he has the audacity to act so high and mighty. I'll send him straight to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Emmett advanced on Osborne, a terrifying aura surrounded him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Riley Raglan has just two minutes left in his training! In that time, I'll shatter every bone in this guy's body and strip the skin from his flesh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His words dripped with malice as he lunged forward, but Diana couldn't just stand by and watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, watch out!" she cried out, rushing to intervene and protect him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To her, Osborne seemed like nothing more than a novice against Emmett, the peak Celestial Deity on the brink of becoming a Deity Overlord. If she didn't act, Emmett would surely kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, as she prepared to intervene, Emmett's four companions moved as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One was a mid-level Deity Overlord, and the other three were peak Celestial Deities. They easily intercepted Diana, holding her back with a force that left her feeling utterly helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despair washed over her as she realized she could do nothing to save Osborne from the impending doom that loomed ever closer.</span></p><div class="pagination">
