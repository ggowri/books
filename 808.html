  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once everyone had left, Marvin sprang into action.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His voice was cold and resolute. "Freeze the space, and let's see how you can escape now! Dare to disrupt the Williamson family's plans and humiliate my son, and I'll make sure you die right here!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin unleashed a tremendous wave of power, an eerie force that seeped into the void and quickly vanished from sight.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the same time, a faint ripple spread through the space, much like ripples in water, expanding outward. Ordinary people wouldn't notice anything amiss, but the space touched by these ripples was instantly frozen, becoming incredibly solid.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In no time, the space within a 1640-foot radius centered on the Williamson Castle was completely frozen by Marvin's magic.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marvin's face was slightly pale, clearly showing the toll that wielding such a mighty spell took.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even for a Class S powerhouse like him, it was no small feat and required significant energy.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But to Marvin, it was worth it.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's survival would forever stain the Williamson family's honor, and Cuthbert would carry psychological scars that might prevent him from ever advancing beyond Class AAA.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's hope they can handle it without me having to intervene personally," Marvin murmured, closing his eyes.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Osborne jolted upright in the courtyard, his face turning grim.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "The space has been frozen? Is this the power of some divine artifact or the work of a Class S?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Can every Class S freeze space?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Williamson family clearly didn't intend for me to leave alive; freezing the space is meant to prevent my escape. They must be gearing up to act soon!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's expression hardened.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "Given Emma and the others' speed, they should be far from Tethynia by now.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Williamson family will have a tough time catching them again. I need to save myself!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Osborne stood up, assessing the strength of the frozen space.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "With my current spatial power, tearing through this space to perform interdimensional travel is feasible, but it would drain my mental energy and affect the distance I can travel.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Better to keep this as a last resort.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For now, I should get out of Williamson Castle."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne swiftly moved toward the outskirts of the Williamson Castle, feeling a multitude of eyes on him from the shadows, all filled with malicious intent.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ignoring them, he quickly exited the bounds of the Williamson Castle.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Williamson Castle was perched by the sea, with the vast ocean stretching out before it and a dense, untamed jungle behind it. Osborne hesitated for a moment but decided against escaping by sea.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He mused, "The ocean may be vast, but there are few places to hide. Even if I went underwater, the Williamson family's experts would likely find me easily. Besides, they probably expect me to flee by sea and have already sealed it off.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I'll go the opposite way and head into the jungle."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that decision, Osborne dashed into the jungle, disappearing in an instant.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moments later, several figures emerged in pursuit.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking in the direction Osborne had vanished, they said, "He didn't head for the sea but dove into the jungle? Hmph, doesn't matter. He won't get away. Follow him!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They plunged into the jungle after him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne moved swiftly through the underbrush, using the jungle's cover to his advantage.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne quickly began to remove his disguise. Using a special agent, he soon stripped away the makeup, revealing his true appearance. He then pulled out a new set of clothes from his Dimensional Space and changed into them.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne felt a twinge of relief; fortunately, his mastery of spatial power was strong enough. If it weren't for that, he wouldn't have been able to access Dimensional Space with the area frozen like this.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, having removed his makeup and changed his clothes, Osborne was a completely different person.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He suppressed his powers and blended in, appearing just like any ordinary person.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now, they shouldn't be able to recognize me!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A smile crept across Osborne's face.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before long, he heard a whoosh through the air as several figures appeared not far away. They glanced at him briefly before moving on, seemingly uninterested.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne pretended not to notice, casually observing his surroundings like a regular tourist.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, his expression hardened as he sensed the group turning back toward him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne thought, "Have they figured me out?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Keeping his cool, he feigned ignorance. The four figures were Class AAA powerhouses, and they fixated on Osborne from a distance.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One of them suddenly exclaimed, "He's suspicious!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the blink of an eye, the four figures closed in, surrounding him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne acted startled. "W... What do you want? Who are you?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The quartet exchanged cynical smirks.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Axell, stop the charade! We recognized you the moment you walked in. Who knew your disguise skills were this good? You almost had us fooled!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Still wearing a mask of feigned terror, Osborne stammered, "What are you talking about? I don't understand."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Enough with the games! Let's take him out!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ignoring his protests, they lunged at him, powerful attacks instantly enveloping Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His demeanor shifted; now, his expression turned icy and resolute.</p><div class="pagination">
