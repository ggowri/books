  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was relentless in his assault. Despite having the upper hand, pummeling Gerardo with a barrage of attacks that left him barely able to defend himself, killing Gerardo was proving to be no easy feat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's defenses were simply too robust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with tactics designed specifically to break through his defenses, it would take time to finish Gerardo off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had overheard the conversation between Gerardo and Armstrong, but he found himself at a loss for how to counter it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Armstrong had finally been persuaded by Gerardo, he was forced to split his focus, diverting some of his power to deal with Armstrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armstrong was no slouch; he was a top-tier Class S himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he might not be as powerful as Gerardo, who had fused with two divine remains, he was still a formidable opponent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Armstrong joining the fray, Osborne found it increasingly difficult to maintain his dominance over Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Gerardo got a moment to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The horrific wounds that had once plagued him began to heal rapidly, and his expression shifted from despair to one of renewed confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo taunted, his voice gaining strength, "Osborne, what good is your strength if you're going to die today?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Armstrong, keep him occupied for a bit! I'm about to unleash my ultimate move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armstrong nodded. He summoned even more power, pushing back against Osborne's relentless attacks to buy Gerardo some precious time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frustration flickered across Osborne's face as he realized he had to deal with Armstrong first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He snarled, "I was planning to take care of Gerardo first and give you a little more time to live. But since you've chosen to step in, I'll make sure to finish you off too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he launched a furious assault on Armstrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, he kept a wary eye on Gerardo, aware of the potential threat posed by his so-called "ultimate move."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even with his vigilance, Armstrong felt the weight of Osborne's power pressing down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he engaged Osborne in battle, he understood just how brutal the fight would be. Armstrong finally grasped why Gerardo, fused with two divine remains, had been struggling against Osborne's overwhelming strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was a beast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strength, speed, and combat skills were far beyond those of a typical top-tier Class S. Just a single strike from Osborne sent shockwaves through Armstrong, leaving him reeling and struggling to maintain his defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne had the upper hand, pushing Armstrong back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gerardo! Are you ready with that ultimate move yet? Hurry up! I can't hold out much longer!" Armstrong shouted, his voice tinged with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo couldn't help but chuckle at the desperation in Armstrong's tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ultimate move? Sorry, but I don't have anything like that! This guy is a monster! Even if we team up, we can only hold out a little longer before he takes us down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, thanks for stalling him, Armstrong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I've got to make my exit now! Once I'm back and have fused with more divine remains, I'll come back for revenge and take this guy down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, a dimensional rift appeared before Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, he stepped through it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, both Osborne and Armstrong were left dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo was actually escaping!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's brows furrowed tightly. He had been too preoccupied with Armstrong, and now he was too far away to stop Gerardo from using the interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All he could do was watch helplessly as Gerardo vanished into the rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gerardo, you traitor! You bastard!" Armstrong roared, fury boiling within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armstrong couldn't believe it. Gerardo had called for his help not to defeat Osborne but merely to hold Osborne off while he made a run for it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gerardo's getting away! What am I supposed to do now?" Armstrong thought, panic creeping into his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's icy glare fixed on Armstrong, his rage simmering just beneath the surface. "So you're Armstrong from the League of Divine Descent, huh? Great! Because of you, Gerardo managed to slip away. Now it's your turn to pay the price!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Osborne launched a furious attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No longer worried about Gerardo's ultimate move, he unleashed his full strength, making his power a terrifying force that Armstrong simply couldn't withstand. Within just three strikes, Armstrong found himself battered and on the brink of defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armstrong cried out, blood spilling from his lips, "Stop! Look, Osborne! We can talk this out! You can't kill me! I'm part of the Thornberry family! My father is Helios, the strongest being on the Blue Planet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's still alive, you know! If you dare to kill me, my father will come out of his seclusion and hunt you down for revenge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You might be strong, but he's no match for my dad! He's on the verge of becoming a true god!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just let me go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice grew frantic, desperation hanging on every word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne's expression remained chill, devoid of any empathy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think I'd let you walk away after you killed my sister? Time's up! It's lights out for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a fit of rage, Osborne swung a powerful punch that shattered Armstrong's defenses. With a sickening crunch, his fist drove straight into Armstrong's chest, creating a gaping wound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armstrong's face went pale, his breath catching as shock settled in.</span></p><div class="pagination">
