  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne is currently in a dilemma.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On one side is the legendary Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign, where only Imperial Empyrean Sacredness Warriors can barely survive&mdash;a mysterious route leading straight into the depths of the universe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On the other side is a rapidly approaching Warrior at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Choosing to enter the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign almost guarantees death, but if he refuses to step in, he will be caught by the Warrior at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection. He is no match for him. Moreover, over ten other Warriors at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection and Great Perfection are following closely behind, leaving no chance of survival either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne has never been an indecisive person, but at this moment, he doesn't know what to choose.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whoosh!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, a sword light tore through the void, accompanied by a tall figure emerging from the void, appearing not far from Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment he saw Osborne, a cold smile appeared on his face. "I finally caught up with you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying this, he immediately prepared to strike, attempting to quickly deal with Osborne and seize his Kingdom Duel Scorepoints to avoid interference from those chasing behind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, just as he made his move, his expression suddenly changed, and he swiftly looked behind Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He exclaimed, "Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he quickly retreated, as if terrified of being devoured by this terrifying presence.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, a glimmer of hope flashed in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So it's not just me who fears this Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign, even the one hunting me is more terrified and frightened! After all, he is merely at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, not an Imperial Empyrean Sacredness Warrior, and has no chance of surviving in the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Moreover, I possess spatial power and time powers, which might give me a sliver of hope in the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign, whereas once he enters, he is doomed to certain death!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne suddenly felt much more at ease.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at the man and calmly said, "Who are you? Hunting me so openly and stealing my Kingdom Duel Scorepoints, aren't you afraid of being ridiculed?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man sneered after hearing this, "Ridiculed? Who would laugh at me? If I succeed, others will only envy and be jealous of me. That's over 46 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints! Enough for me to exchange for four, maybe even five supreme Sacred Artifacts from the Glorious Divine Kingdom's treasury!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And I, Lionel Lawson, have been cultivating for tens of thousands of years, stuck at the Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection cultivation level for a full ten thousand years. I've traveled through several Stellar Regions, set foot on countless resource-bearing planets, ventured into numerous perilous secret lands, and tried everything, yet all I've obtained is this one supreme Sacred Artifact in my hand."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, Lionel glanced down at the longsword in his hand and continued, "And now, as long as I kill you, I can obtain 46 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints. I won't miss such a great opportunity. As for whether I'll be ridiculed, those who don't dare to make a move against you are the real joke!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he glanced once more at the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a Warrior at the Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection level, he was well aware of the terrifying nature of this path. With his strength, entering it would undoubtedly mean certain death.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the past, he had always dared not approach the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, this time, due to being too focused on chasing Osborne, he unknowingly approached this forbidden area. When he realized it, he instinctively chose to move away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, there was still some distance between him and the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign. The suction coming from it was not strong and had almost no effect on him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as he didn't actively fly into it, there shouldn't be any problems.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, he coldly said to Osborne, "Now, hand over your Kingdom Duel Badge! Give me all your Kingdom Duel Scorepoints. Considering I'm in a relatively good mood today, I might spare your life!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne sneered upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Who is this Lionel?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He tried to recall but couldn't remember this person. He wasn't sure if it was because he had never heard of the name or if the other party had deliberately used a fake name.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, this person's appearance was also disguised.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although his disguise was extremely convincing, in Osborne's Satan's Eye, all disguises were futile. Osborne had already seen his true appearance. As long as he managed to survive this time, Osborne would eventually uncover this person's true identity and seek revenge when the opportunity arose.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, at this moment, what he should do most is to escape the current predicament.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Lionel's words, Osborne took out his Kingdom Duel Badge and looked at the long number on it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Forty-six billion is indeed a fortune that lingers in one's mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was merely a small figure who had not yet reached Empyrean Sacredness, yet he possessed such immense wealth. In this strength-driven world, where warriors could trample on rules and laws at will, it seemed unreasonable that no one had targeted him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ultimately, it was because his strength was lacking.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lionel spoke coldly, "I'll give you ten more seconds! Hand over your Kingdom Duel Badge within ten seconds, and I might spare your life. If you still refuse after ten seconds, don't blame me for taking action. To be honest, I am at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection. Killing you would be as easy as crushing an ant!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't even think about stalling for time, waiting for others to catch up, and then using our fight to escape in the chaos. I won't give you such a chance!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hand over the Kingdom Duel Badge immediately!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Or I'll kill you right now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A chilling, bone-piercing killing intent suddenly erupted from Lionel, surging like a tide and pressing down on Osborne. Even without any tangible force impact, Osborne felt a faint pain on his skin.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it were an ordinary Ascension Ten Supernal Deity King, under such terrifying killing intent, they would likely be too frightened to speak, possibly even dropping to their knees to beg for mercy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne merely let out a cold laugh and mocked, "You want me to hand over the Kingdom Duel Badge willingly? Do you think that's possible? If you have the guts, come and take it! Even if I bring the Kingdom Duel Badge into the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign, I will never give it to you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, Osborne immediately took action.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He sped off in the direction of the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Lionel's expression changed drastically.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He roared angrily, "Stop right there! Entering the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign will surely get you killed. Even I wouldn't survive. Stop now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne would not stop because of this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Lionel instantly became anxious. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne really charges into the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign, it</span><span>'</span><span>ll be a huge problem. Osborne will definitely die, and the Kingdom Duel Badge will be lost inside.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even with my strength, I wouldn</span><span>'</span><span>t dare to recklessly go in and search.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, I</span><span>'</span><span>ll gain nothing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Osborne getting closer to the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign, Lionel gritted his teeth and cursed under his breath, "Damn it! You want to die? Not that easy! Even if you</span><span>'</span><span>re going to die, hand over the Kingdom Duel Badge first!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Lionel rushed toward Osborne at an astonishing speed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had to stop Osborne and seize the Kingdom Duel Badge before he was completely locked and dragged in by the pulling force of the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whoosh!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Whoosh!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne and Lionel, one after the other, rapidly approached the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign. Osborne could clearly feel the pulling force growing stronger as the distance shortened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had to frantically channel Sacred Power just to barely resist the pull of this force.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he got any closer, his body would lose control and be firmly locked by the power of the Sacred Path of the Empyrean Sovereign, forcibly dragged inside!</span></p><div class="pagination">
