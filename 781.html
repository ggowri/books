  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next,&nbsp;Osborne&nbsp;experimented with the&nbsp;lightning elemental essence,&nbsp;light elemental essence, and other elemental essences, confirming that they could all be enhanced using&nbsp;star power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's&nbsp;mind became more active, brimming with ideas.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The only power I haven't mastered yet is my&nbsp;psychic power. Should I take this chance to grasp the&nbsp;Spirit Realm&nbsp;as well?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After all,&nbsp;star power&nbsp;can quickly boost the essence of any power. Even if I train in four domains simultaneously, my progress will still be faster than others!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The&nbsp;Spirit Realm&nbsp;is definitely not weak!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne&nbsp;quickly solidified his decision.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While his&nbsp;comprehension&nbsp;was still heightened, he immediately began understanding the&nbsp;Spirit Domain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, before fully mastering the&nbsp;Spirit Realm,&nbsp;Osborne first mastered two intermediate-level&nbsp;psychic abilities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Psychic Blast!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Psychic Tear!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Both techniques were direct attacks on the enemy's mental strength, damaging their mental strength tremendously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially&nbsp;Psychic Tear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the past,&nbsp;Osborne&nbsp;had used the&nbsp;Death's Sickle&nbsp;to perform&nbsp;Psychic Tear, ripping apart his enemies' mental strength and inflicting serious damage on both their minds and souls.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, he no longer needed to rely on the&nbsp;Death's Sickle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His current&nbsp;Psychic Tear&nbsp;was even more powerful than before, capable of devastating an enemy's mental strength in a single blow, even causing them to experience&nbsp;mental collapse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, the night passed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Every time the boost to their&nbsp;comprehension&nbsp;faded,&nbsp;Emma&nbsp;would cling to&nbsp;Osborne, using various techniques to make him incredibly pleased.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, the two of them would use their heightened&nbsp;comprehension again to delve deeper into mastering their respective domains.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By the third round,&nbsp;Emma&nbsp;made her breakthrough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She finally mastered her first domain, the&nbsp;Death Domain!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The&nbsp;Death Domain&nbsp;was terrifying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whenever&nbsp;Emma&nbsp;activated the&nbsp;Death Domain, any enemy caught within it would rapidly lose their life force. Even those who tried to resist using their own domain's power couldn't prevent their life energy from fading away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Additionally,&nbsp;Emma&nbsp;could actively drain the life force of her enemies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In short, entering the&nbsp;Death Domain&nbsp;meant that death was the only outcome unless it was countered quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The most frightening aspect was that&nbsp;Emma's Death Domain&nbsp;was tied to her&nbsp;Death's Stare, making it incredibly stable. Even if&nbsp;Osborne&nbsp;collided with his&nbsp;Spatial Domain&nbsp;or self-destructed his domain, he wouldn't be able to shatter hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With the&nbsp;Death Domain,&nbsp;Emma's&nbsp;power instantly became terrifying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even&nbsp;Osborne&nbsp;had to be careful when dealing with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However,&nbsp;Osborne&nbsp;didn't fall behind. Before dawn, he finally mastered the&nbsp;Spirit Realm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once the&nbsp;Spirit Realm&nbsp;was activated, it suppressed the enemy's mental strength, drastically reducing their power and trapping them in a continuous illusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The best part was that using&nbsp;Psychic Blast&nbsp;and&nbsp;Psychic Tear became effortless for&nbsp;Osborne, and their destructive power was tremendous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately, the&nbsp;Spirit Realm&nbsp;wasn't stable yet, making it vulnerable to being shattered by stronger enemies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Next, I'll use&nbsp;star power&nbsp;to enhance my&nbsp;lightning elemental essence,&nbsp;spatial essence, and&nbsp;psychic essence!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne&nbsp;murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At dawn, both&nbsp;Osborne&nbsp;and&nbsp;Emma&nbsp;stopped training, their states having reached their peak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Finally mastered it! I can't wait to test my&nbsp;Death Domain&nbsp;on someone!"&nbsp;Emma&nbsp;said, her confidence soaring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne&nbsp;smiled lightly. "Today is&nbsp;Cuthbert's Honor Quest Ceremony. He's ranked 35th on the Godson Rankings. Wait, no... 36th now. If you want to test your&nbsp;Death Domain, you can challenge him. With his strength, he can push your domain to its limits.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you can beat&nbsp;Cuthbert, you'll be famous worldwide. You'll also win an&nbsp;ancient divine artifact&nbsp;and a massive reward of five trillion dollars."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing this,&nbsp;Emma&nbsp;stuck out her tongue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Challenge&nbsp;Cuthbert? And beat him? I can't imagine that! Right now, I'm not his match, unless he's already exhausted after a series of battles. Maybe then I can sneak in a win.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"According to the challenge rules, those who aren't ranked on the&nbsp;Global Godson Rankings&nbsp;must first challenge Cuthbert. After he defeats us all, the ranked challengers will battle him, starting from the lowest-ranked to the highest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"With&nbsp;Cuthbert's&nbsp;strength, defeating all those who aren't ranked on the&nbsp;Godson Rankings&nbsp;will be a breeze, so it won't wear him out much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I won't have the chance to sneak in an easy win.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But you're right. Even if I can't win, I'll still challenge him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma&nbsp;was filled with fighting spirit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at&nbsp;Osborne&nbsp;and said, "You're ranked 465th on the&nbsp;Global Godson Rankings, which means there are still 19 people from Earth's younger generation ranked lower than you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In other words, you'll be the 20th&nbsp;Godson&nbsp;to challenge&nbsp;Cuthbert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By then,&nbsp;Cuthbert&nbsp;should have used up much of his strength. Can you beat him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you defeat him, you'll win an&nbsp;ancient divine artifact, you know!"</p><div class="pagination">
