  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Shawn's loud command, all kinds of attacks came towards Osborne in an instant. The terrifying fluctuations of power covered the sea surface within a radius of several miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The originally calm sea surface suddenly became turbulent and huge waves were raised, making everything around like a doomsday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among the attacks, Yaron struck Osborne the </span><span>most fierce</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Luther family inherited the water elemental power for centuries, which was extremely intense at sea. Yaron could easily create a towering wave that pressed towards Osborne like a high wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and Clarissa seemed extremely powerless in the face of these attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But facing these attacks, Osborne showed no fear at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this </span><span>what</span><span> you can do? If you think you can kill me with such something like scratches, don't even think about it." After murmuring, Osborne moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A layer of </span><span>pale yellow</span><span> halo suddenly burst out from his body, rapidly expanding to protect him, Clarissa, and even the entire yacht.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the martial art aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the attacks kept hitting him in an instant, but they seemed to have hit an invisible barrier and were blocked by Osborne's martial art aura, causing ripples on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were turbulent waves outside the martial art aura, but it was calm inside. No attack could break through the defense of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a situation immediately shocked Shawn, Yaron and others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Holy shit! His strength is even stronger than we expected. Compared to when he fought the Paltrow family, his strength has become even stronger. We can't kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn's face looked extremely displeased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had overestimated Osborne's power as much as possible, which was why all the masters of the four ancient families were dispatched, and even launched a sneak attack, hoping to severely injure Osborne in an instant, or even kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, he found that he had underestimated Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's strength had become even more overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, attack together!" Shawn gritted his teeth. The battle had already begun, and there was no way to retreat. Either they would kill Osborne, or Osborne would kill them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To retreat meant death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, everyone moved. Class A Power Masters attacked Osborne from a </span><span>distance, and Class A martial masters wrestled with him. Even those Class A- masters launched their most powerful attacks, trying to provide as much help as possible, although their help could be ignored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne faced these with a sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, his power was on the same level as before. What made him so calm in encountering this battle was because his master of the power became more proficient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the battle with the Paltrow family, Osborne had just broken through to become a Class A Power Master. He didn't even have time to adapt to the surging power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, after a few days, he has adapted to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could use his power more at ease. The benefits of the fusion of the soul of powers and his body were greater than he had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His martial art aura merged with the Devil's Light, becoming a fresh new aura that was both offensive and defensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could exert his power faster and more strongly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most important improvement was his physics. After integrating the soul of powers, his body far exceeded the level of ordinary Class A martial master and was even superior to Class A+ ones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he was with the Murphy family, he was able to defeat Raven, who was already a Class A+ master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would only be stronger now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There </span><span>were</span><span> a total of fifteen Class A masters in the four ancient families, but only six of them could strike from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was like a daydream for only six metahuman masters to break his upgraded martial art aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though there were another three of them, they couldn't hurt him at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had no intention of dodging and sneered, "I suggest you should run now, but if you refuse to do so, you must prepare something more than these harmless tricks. Let me guess, you have contacted the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> to help you, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn's face suddenly changed when he heard this. "I don't know what you are talking about, but you have to die today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly. "You don't want to admit it, right? Do you think you hide your conspiracy with the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shawn's expression changed again, but he gritted his teeth and said nothing, only attacking more fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, their attacks could not break Osborne's martial art aura at all, which set Shawn and others in desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap was really too big!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne continued, "It doesn't matter if you don't admit it. When I kill you all, the people from the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> will naturally appear."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he finally took the initiative to attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His attack was very simple, just punching one after another, but each of his punches was infused with the Spiral Force, an advanced martial art.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already mastered this trick and was not far from the top level of it. Coupled with his already terrifying strength, he had become something that the four ancient </span><span>families couldn't compete with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first ones who suffered from his horrifying power were Class A martial masters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every punch from him could injure them so badly that they would vomit blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had practiced martial arts for decades and had honed their bodies to be invulnerable, but in front of Osborne's fists, they seemed so weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they were all Class A martial masters, Osborne was more than one level stronger than them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when facing Class A+ masters, they didn't feel such desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, six of the nine Class A martial masters were seriously injured by him. The remaining three reacted quickly and fled away in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at the overwhelming Osborne in horror at this moment.</span></p><div class="pagination">
