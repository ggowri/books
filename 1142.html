  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nine Dark Exotic Beasts had come to a halt, but the terrified screams of the three people didn't stop. The beast's massive jaws were perilously close to snapping them up, and they could smell the foul, rancid odor wafting from its mouth, prompting them to shut their eyes in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all braced for the inevitable, convinced that in the next moment, they would be devoured whole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like an eternity of screaming, they realized they hadn't felt any pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slowly, they opened their eyes, only to be met with the sight of the monstrous jaws right in front of them, sending them into another round of panicked shrieks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rihanna! Viggo, Ariana, stop screaming!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the middle-aged man's voice rang out as he swiftly dragged all three of them out from beneath those beasts' maw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced back at the nine-headed Dark Exotic Beast, which was frozen in place, his face a mask of shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, faint footsteps echoed through the air. The middle-aged man tensed up, fearing there might be more Ferocious Beasts lurking nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to see three figures slowly approaching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those three were none other than Osborne, Anastasia, and Zoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia and Zoe each held onto one of Osborne's arms as they made their way through the dense jungle. As they drew closer, the thorns and vines parted effortlessly for them, making it seem like they were on a leisurely stroll rather than navigating a treacherous wilderness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing Osborne and his companions, the middle-aged man let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that relief quickly shifted to concern; he couldn't gauge the strength of Osborne and his companions. The nine Dark Exotic Beasts had suddenly become immobile, and their timely arrival was too much of a coincidence. He knew they must have had a hand in this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he couldn't understand what kind of power could immobilize nine Class A Dark Exotic Beasts in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked so young. Osborne appeared to be in his twenties, while Anastasia and Zoe looked barely out of their teens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you guys alright?" Osborne asked with a friendly smile as they approached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man, still serious, quickly bowed slightly. "Thank you! We're fine, but if it weren't for you, we'd surely be done for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled. "No need for thanks; it was just a small favor. But you really shouldn't be so reckless. The </span><span>Lostridge</span><span> Mountains are dangerous these days. With your level of skill, wandering this deep into the wild is a risky move."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man, </span><span>Cillian Carey, looked downcast at the reminder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's my fault! By the way, we're from a wealthy family, the Carey family, in Eidolon City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm Cillian, and these are my siblings&mdash;Viggo, Ariana, and Rihanna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"May I ask for your names?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cillian was exceedingly polite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Viggo, Ariana, and Rihanna started to recover from their fright and hurriedly expressed their gratitude to Osborne and his sisters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne </span><span>smiled,</span><span> his demeanor relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Carey family from Eidolon City?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had never heard of them, but then again, there were countless wealthy families in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, with Ancient Families numbering in the hundreds. It was impossible for him to know them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the fact that a single wealthy family had produced four Class A masters was impressive. And they were all so young&mdash;this suggested that the Carey family was likely more powerful than the average Ancient Family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eidolon City wasn't too far from Newport City, separated only by the </span><span>Lostridge</span><span> Mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm Osborne Augustine," he introduced himself, gesturing to his companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These are my younger sisters, Anastasia and Zoe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Cillian's eyes lit up, his breath quickening. "Wait a minute, are you all from the Augustine family? The Augustine family from Newport City? We came here looking to reach out for help from the Augustine family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear Cillian didn't recognize him. After all, he was just another guy from a rich family, nowhere near the upper echelons of a powerhouse like the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "What kind of help does he need?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curiously, Osborne asked, "Yes. So, you really are looking for assistance from the Augustine family in Newport City? Why don't you tell me what this is about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cillian </span><span>hesitated,</span><span> anxiety etched on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well... Osborne, I'm really sorry, but this matter is quite sensitive. I can't disclose any details without first informing the higher-ups in the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I hope you can take us to Newport City. Once we meet with them, I promise to explain everything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but smirk, thinking, "Does Cillian really think I'm just one of the younger generations from the Augustine family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could be so. That was why he was hesitant to share details with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, his smile unchanging, "I can certainly take you to see the Augustine Estate. However, I have some other pressing matters to attend to first. Your situation </span><span>can't be that urgent, can it? How about you wait for a bit?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cillian looked startled. "Osborne, that's not a great idea! This place is way too dangerous. We've made our way all the way from Eidolon City and encountered countless Ferocious Beasts. There must be at least 100 thousand of those beasts gathered around us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Beast Tide is coming; we really need to get out of here fast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cillian's worry was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, just chuckled. "No need to sweat it. I came here specifically to handle the Beast Tide!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
