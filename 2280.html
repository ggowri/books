  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The release of the state duel power rankings had a sobering effect on the disciples of the Mystic Sirius Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, on whom they had pinned their hopes, hadn't even cracked the top hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bethan and Jamar fared even worse, ranked near the bottom, after eight hundred&mdash;virtually the weakest of all the state duel contestants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you guys still going to the state duel to watch?" someone asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh! I was all set to go and cheer Osborne on, but now I'm having second thoughts. There are so many powerhouses in this state duel. Osborne doesn't seem to have a shot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the point of going when we already know it's a lost cause? Traveling </span><span>to the place </span><span>and getting tickets aren't cheap. Why spend money just to watch Osborne and the others get thrashed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't feel like going either..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, I'm definitely going to watch. Even if I know Osborne and the others probably won't win, it's a wilderness battle. You never know what might happen. Maybe they'll catch a lucky break."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's even tougher precisely because it's a wilderness battle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Luck? Even with a stroke of good luck, can they take on a strong team? Some teams have several members ranked in the top hundred, even ten or twenty. If Osborne runs into them, he might as well throw in the towel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not going. I'll just stay in the sect and wait for the news."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going! Not for any other reason, but to see if those at the top of the power rankings are really as powerful as they're said to be. It'll give me some goals to aim for..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, watch out. You don't want your confidence to take a beating."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chatter wasn't limited to the disciples of the Mystic Sirius Sect. Folks from every major faction were weighing in on the rankings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over at Azure Haven Academy, Leroy did a double-take when she saw her name at the ninety-sixth spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the sole representative from Tempest Fortress City to make it into the top hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, I'm ranked higher than Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's probably fuming. He won the Tempest Fortress City championship but couldn't crack the top hundred, and here I am, someone he beat, outranking him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still, this ranking makes perfect sense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Leroy spoke, a long spear burst into her grasp, surrounded by roaring flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I owe you big time. If you hadn't knocked me out when you did, I'd probably have been devoured by the Inferno Drake Lance. There's no way I'd have been able to fully master it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even though I'm in your debt, I'm gonna take you down in the state duel! I'll show you that I've outgrown you," Leroy declared, her eyes ablaze with a ferocious fighting spirit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over at Fantasia Isle, Clara was checking out the power rankings too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw her name at the 299th spot, she puckered her lips in a pout, her face scrunched up in annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She muttered, "Almost dropped out of the top three hundred? Seriously?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare they look down on me! They've got Leroy at 96th, and I'm on the verge of falling out of the top three hundred. Is there really that much of a gap between us? Even if she's fully mastered the Inferno Drake Lance, I'm not backing down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh! And they've got Osborne ranked below Leroy, outside the top hundred. They're really dissing Osborne big time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it. I'm done with this ridiculous ranking list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once the state duel wraps up, they'll realize how laughable this ranking is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara huffed, then took off to resume her solitary training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, nearly all the contestants in the state duel had caught a glimpse of the state duel power rankings. Some nodded in agreement, while others scowled in discontent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless, the unveiling of these rankings had given them a rough idea of who their opponents were, so they weren't going into the duel completely blind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A good number of them were champing at the bit, eager to strut their stuff in the state duel and make a splash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even more were already busy schmoozing, using the rankings as a guide to find potential allies for a short-term alliance in the state duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They lacked the strength to go it alone, so their only shot at a good outcome in the state duel was to band together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The real heavy-hitters, the ones at the very top of the state duel power rankings, like Agatha, Horace, Broderick, and Benson, sneered at the thought of teaming up with others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were so powerful that they were a force unto themselves!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne was in seclusion and had no idea about the state duel power rankings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he did, he wouldn't give it a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strength had come a long way since the city duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Finally, it's fully integrated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne opened his eyes, his eyes alight with excitement. Guided by Adriana, he'd started to blend thunder power into his Sacred Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, he'd finally pulled it off!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could keenly feel that his Sacred Power had reached new heights of profundity and might. It wasn't a mere arithmetic addition where the result was predictable. Instead, it was as if the combination of different forces had sparked a synergy, creating an effect that far exceeded the sum of its parts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Blending three powers, not too shabby, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I'm probably ten times stronger than when I took part in the city duel! After all, I've reached the Ascension Nine cultivation level, and my Sacred Power has also taken a leap forward!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If I were to cross paths with Leroy again... even if she fully mastered the Sacred Artifact Inferno Drake Lance and didn't get backfired or lose control... I could take her down with ease!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">One arrow would do the trick!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smile spread across Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">However, Leroy has a Sacred Artifact. I'm afraid a lot of other contestants in the state duel will have them too! The Bloodwrought Bow is starting to show its age...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Thankfully, the Bloodwrought Bow can absorb Azure Ore once more!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">For the next little while, I'll integrate all the Azure Ore into the Bloodwrought Bow and let it transform into a Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having made up his mind, Osborne wasted no time and got down to business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He started to use his Sacred Power to melt the Azure Ore one by one and infuse it into the Bloodwrought Bow. Thanks to the enhancement of his Sacred Power, he could melt the Azure Ore at a much quicker pace. In just three days, he'd managed to fully integrate nearly a thousand pieces of Azure Ore into the bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right away, the Bloodwrought Bow began to undergo a transformation. An otherworldly, blood-red glow erupted from it, and a terrifying power started to take shape within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That power was none other than Sacred Power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After soaking up the energy from over two thousand pieces of Azure Ore, the Bloodwrought Bow finally reached its peak strength. It was on the verge of a complete metamorphosis and was about to become a Sacred Artifact!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne clasped the Bloodwrought Bow tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he felt an intimate connection, as if the bow was an extension of his very being. A mighty force radiated from the bow and coursed through his body, filling him with such power that he felt he could pierce the sky with a single arrow!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Damn, it's so powerful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">A Sacred Artifact truly outshines a quasi-Sacred Artifact! With the Sacred Artifact Bloodwrought Bow in my hands, my odds of shining in the state duel have just skyrocketed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Too bad the dark, spatial, and lightning elemental essences still haven't hit the Level Ten Peak. If they had, I'd be an absolute force to be reckoned with!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">It's nearly time to head to the state duel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A steely determination flashed across Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Alright, it's time to break this seclusion. After the state duel, I've got three months to recharge before the zone duel kicks off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">By then, I've got to integrate the fourth power. And I'll make sure all the elemental essences I'm working on reach the Level Ten Peak!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that resolve, Osborne wrapped up his seclusion and stepped out of his dwelling.</span></p><div class="pagination">
