  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne halted his movements as he saw Alfreda concede defeat, a satisfied smile spreading across his face as he gazed at her, her expression a mix of resentment and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure enough, the absolute forbidden zone really does the trick!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Osborne had activated the absolute forbidden zone, Alfreda's Luminous Elven Wings had caused him considerable trouble. No matter what he tried, overcoming her proved nearly impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But once he unleashed the absolute forbidden zone, Alfreda didn't even entertain the thought of continuing the fight; she simply surrendered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, this was also because Osborne's relentless attacks had nearly shattered her Luminous Elven Wings. If they hadn't been so severely damaged, there was no way she would have given up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her Luminous Elven Wings were formidable; even with her cultivation level suppressed to Ascension Four, they could unleash tremendous power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She might not have been able to defeat Osborne outright, but she could have put up a fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the battle concluded, Alfreda approached Osborne, her eyes wide with shock and lingering resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, she finally asked, "Osborne, have you mastered Sacred Power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment but then nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, due to some special circumstances, I have indeed mastered Sacred Power. I've fused space elemental essence with dark elemental essence to create a new form of Sacred Power essence! However, I can only claim a weakened version of Sacred Power, far from the level of an Empyrean Sacredness warrior."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's jaw dropped, his words leaving her momentarily speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She murmured, utterly astonished, "Is it really true? You've actually mastered Sacred Power and possess its very essence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible? You're only an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King! How could you possibly fuse different elemental powers? How could you wield Sacred Power? Even if your talent rivals that of a Celestial Progeny, it shouldn't be possible for you to master Sacred Power at this stage!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the entire history of Elf City spanning a hundred thousand years, there have been only a handful of individuals who mastered Luminous Elven Wings without reaching Empyrean Sacredness. But those who grasped Sacred Power before reaching that level? There are absolutely fewer than ten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The earliest among them didn't achieve Sacred Power until they reached Ascension Eight Supernal Deity King! And here you are, mastering it at Ascension Two?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you... from Umbra World?" Alfreda gazed at Osborne, her eyes wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a bit exasperated. First, Alfreda suspected he was disguised from the Sacred Dragon Clan or the Sacred Tiger Clan, and now she was entertaining the idea that he hailed from Umbra World.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He replied, "The truth is, my mastery of Sacred Power is due to external aid, not solely my own abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not something easily replicable! It's not about my talent; I just got lucky."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after his explanation, Alfreda still struggled to wrap her mind around it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon enough, she regained her composure, realizing something important.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was her friend, her ally in battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stronger he became, the smoother their explorations in Umbra Earth would be, allowing them to delve deeper and reap greater rewards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For her, Osborne's strength was nothing but beneficial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! Being around someone like you really knocks my confidence down a peg! Before I met you, I thought I was the most talented in Elf City&mdash;nobody could hold a candle to my abilities! But now? My confidence has taken a hit, and you owe me for that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, shaking his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Owe you? How exactly am I supposed to repay you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's eyes gleamed with mischief as she replied, "Well, how about this&mdash;whenever we find treasure from now on, if there's something suitable for me, I get first dibs! I refuse to be your little sidekick forever! I'm going to level up my skills, and one day, I'll defeat you, and then you can be my sidekick!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Alfreda's words, Osborne shrugged with a playful grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure thing! If we come across any treasures that suit you, I'll let you pick first! But as for your plans to surpass me and have me as your sidekick... well, you'll have to work hard for that! So far, no one who's been left in my dust has ever managed to catch up again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne spoke confidently, a glint of determination in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda, at this moment, was no match for him, and as their powers grew, the gap between them would only widen. The thought of her surpassing him was simply out of the question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne would never let such a thing happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had the confidence to prevent it, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! Don't get too cocky! I'm different&mdash;I'll definitely catch up and surpass you!" Alfreda shot back, her competitive spirit ignited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she shifted the conversation. "It's been about half a month since we entered Umbra Earth, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In another half month, this whole continent will break through the space barrier and return to Umbra World...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, we need to get back to business!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had spent a total of twelve days in seclusion, which meant they were right on track for their half-month timeline in Umbra Earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been nearly twenty days since he left Celestara!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, a serious expression crossed Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go! We really should continue our exploration! This Death Chasm seems to yield mostly Element Gold Crystals, but those aren't as crucial for us anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I suggest we leave the Death Chasm and venture deeper into Umbra Earth! There's bound to be treasures far more valuable than Element Gold Crystals waiting for us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glanced at Alfreda, his excitement palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, the Death Chasm had lost its value. During his twelve days of </span><span>seclusion</span><span>, his two hundred plus Spatial Clones had scoured most of the chasm branches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had already amassed over three thousand Element Gold Crystals in his Dimensional Space!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Osborne, the Element Gold Crystals no longer held much worth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed other treasures from Umbra Earth to continue boosting his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, more Sacred Crystals, Sacred Elixirs, powerful Sacred Artifacts, or even the elusive Soul of Umbra Earth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda hesitated for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Element Gold Crystals still had value for her, the prospect of more precious treasures deeper within Umbra Earth quickly swayed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's leave the Death Chasm and dive deeper into Umbra Earth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their decision made, they wasted no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They swiftly returned to the main chasm and followed it forward. After about half a day, they finally emerged from the main chasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before them lay a massive platform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they wanted to exit Umbra Earth, this was the spot to use the Spatial Translocator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But neither Osborne nor Alfreda was ready to leave just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stepped onto the platform, both lifting their gazes toward the depths of Umbra Earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before they could fully grasp what lay ahead, something caught their attention&mdash;a stone tablet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tablet seemed to have been erected recently, adorned with a row of glowing characters that stood out prominently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The writing was in Elvish, but Osborne instantly understood its meaning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Up ahead&mdash;Corrosive Marsh! Corrosive Marsh is ten times more dangerous than Death Chasm! Any Elf Race member below Ascension Six should turn back!
