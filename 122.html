  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How much is it worth?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin scoffed, "A million dollars? Or two million dollars? You are the eldest son of an ancient family. Is it really worth getting so worked up over just one bottle of wine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn sneered, "A million dollars? Two million dollars?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That is still not enough! A bottle like this, if it were on the black market, would sell for thirty million dollars in an instant. Believe it or not, it is not just about the price - it is that you cannot even buy it! No matter how much money you have or how high your status, you just cannot get it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How much?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thirty million dollars? Thirty million dollars could buy a large villa in Mayby City, a top-tier piece of jewelry, or ten luxury cars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just for a bottle of wine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin's voice shot up, staring incredulously at the bottle of wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could not understand it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she was the heir of the Montague family, with assets in the hundreds of billions dollars, she could not grasp why a single bottle of wine could cost thirty million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought it should be no more than one or two million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That is right, thirty million dollars! And it is priceless, with no market availability."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn said proudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was full of anticipation. "I never imagined I would have the chance to drink Glacium Beauty. Now I can boast to my wine friends, haha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to thank Osborne for being able to get Glacium Beauty. I am enjoying this because of him! Austin, do not try to snatch it from me. You would not even be able to taste its quality. This bottle is enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn clutched the Glacium Beauty like a treasure, placing a bottle of thirty-five thousand dollars Musigny Grand Cru in front of Austin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said disdainfully, "I used to think this was the top wine. But now that we have Glacium Beauty, this seems like garbage!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin rolled her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why should you have all the fun? I want to try Glacium Beauty too! A thirty-million-dollar wine? Do not think I have not had it - neither my father nor my grandfather has."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me have some too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin and Barlyn started to argue, carefully avoiding breaking the bottle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, let's drink together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne mediated the situation. Barlyn was not really trying to monopolize the wine, so he sat down and eagerly opened the bottle. An intense, almost overwhelming aroma filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn's face showed pure intoxication, as if just the smell had made him drunk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Austin and Osborne, who were not wine enthusiasts, were momentarily stunned by the aroma. It was refreshing, as if it opened their pores.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne understood why this wine was worth six hundred thousand dollars internally and why people on the black market were willing to pay thirty million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was indeed top-tier wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It smells amazing! It is a hundred times better than the best perfume I have ever used."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin exclaimed in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn said excitedly, "Now you see why it is so expensive, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hurry, let me taste it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin was eager.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn stopped her. "Why the rush? With top-tier wine, you cannot just drink it right away. You need to wait fifteen minutes for the aroma to fully develop after opening the bottle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We will drink after fifteen minutes, not a second less."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn was insistent, even though he was impatient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin rolled her eyes but understood that fine wine needed to be treated properly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just fifteen minutes, so they waited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three chatted and waited, and soon ten minutes had passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne felt it was time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled and discreetly pressed a button in his pocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few seconds later, a phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Barlyn's phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn glanced at it, his expression changing, and quickly answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Smith, is something wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Captain Barlyn, you need to come back quickly. There has been an incident that requires your personal handling."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Violet's anxious voice came through the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn asked urgently, "What is going on? Is Clarissa in trouble?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not Ms. Radcliffe, but it is too complicated to explain over the phone. Just come back, and you will understand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The call ended abruptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn's face turned from anxious to distressed. He looked at the bottle of Glacium Beauty with a pained expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Barlyn stood up. "Osborne, Austin, I have an urgent matter to attend to. Wait for me to return so we can drink together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait for me, you have to wait for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do not finish my Glacium Beauty!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn repeated his requests several times before rushing out of the villa and heading back to the Radcliffe Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled as he watched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, the wine is almost ready. Should we wait for Barlyn? Or should we start drinking now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin asked eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied with a smile. "I heard that if wine is left to breathe too long, it can change its taste. We do not know when Barlyn will be back, so let's start drinking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he finished speaking, Austin's eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right! Let's drink first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she quickly poured a glass for herself and Osborne.</span></p><div class="pagination">
