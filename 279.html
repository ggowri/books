  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the core members of the Radcliffe family were assembled in the grand hall of the Radcliffe Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a violent motion, Eugen slammed the file on Osborne onto the solid wood table. The table shattered as if struck by a sledgehammer, pulverized by the mere impact of the thin sheets of paper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Splinters of wood flew in all directions like bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone </span><span>present</span><span> felt the heat of his anger, bowing their heads in silence, not daring even to dodge, allowing the sharp splinters to cut through their exposed skin, leaving behind a trail of fine wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere in the hall was incredibly oppressive, causing everyone to hold their breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugen was genuinely furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, Clarissa and Osborne had publicly announced their relationship in front of the entire upper class of </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>, and the news had reached his ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was even acutely aware of the details of their public embrace and kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugen was enraged and immediately convened a meeting of all core members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments before, Osborne's file had been delivered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After reading it, Eugen became even more furious, his face extremely gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take a look at this young man's information."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group, already curious, picked up the pages quickly, their expressions turning grim as they read.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, their expressions also became extremely grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An orphan? Raised in an orphanage? And he's been divorced?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could such trash be worthy of Clarissa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He saved Clarissa when they were children? Is that why Clarissa has feelings for him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa is being naive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although this trash has some strength and has been Clarissa's bodyguard captain, dutifully protecting her, he is far from the true masters! How could he be worthy of Clarissa?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's faces were gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The information they had on Osborne was only what was on the surface. The fact that he was the owner of Luna Jewelry and </span><span>Skyefall</span><span> Security, and the grandson of Godfather, was beyond the reach of the Radcliffe family's investigation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, in their eyes, Osborne was not a suitable match for Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After everyone finished reading the file, Eugen waved his hand, signaling for silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's discuss how to resolve this matter," he said, his gaze piercing as it swept across the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone bowed their heads, avoiding his direct gaze. His eyes finally rested on the family head, Dylan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dylan, you are her father. You tell us," Eugen commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dylan could only respond with a heavy heart, "Dad..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a meeting. Call me Sir Radcliffe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Sir Radcliffe! This matter is very serious, and I've only just become aware of it. There was no indication beforehand. The people I placed around Clarissa did not notice anything unusual between them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugen interrupted him, his voice cold, "So you're telling me this has nothing to do with you? You are her father and the head of the Radcliffe family! Such a significant event occurs, and you're completely in the dark. How exactly are you fulfilling your role as the head of the family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugen's accusations made Dylan feel wronged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He explained, "Dad, I have just returned from </span><span>Dampston</span><span>, where I was securing a perfect husband for Clarissa from the Paltrow family. The heir, Alexander, has seen Clarissa's photo and is very fond and satisfied with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Paltrow family has agreed to a union with the Radcliffe family. Soon, we will be able to marry Clarissa off to Alexander of the Paltrow family in </span><span>Dampston</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All my focus has been on this matter. I had no idea Clarissa would cause such a stir with Osborne."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Dylan finished explaining, Eugen's expression softened significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said calmly, "You have done well in this matter. The Paltrow family of </span><span>Dampston</span><span> is one of the most powerful ancient families. In terms of wealth, influence, and strength, they far surpass the Chevalier and Lark families in </span><span>Skyefall</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Clarissa could marry into the Paltrow family, Apollo's death might actually be a blessing in disguise! After all, I have heard of Alexander. It is said that when he was born, there were strange omens in the sky, with thunder and lightning all night long. As soon as he was born, he possessed the power of thunder and lightning, a once-in-a-century genius metahuman in the Paltrow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is only twenty-eight years old and is said to be on the verge of becoming a Class A metahuman master. I wonder if he has succeeded. If he has, he would undoubtedly be one of the most outstanding young people in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, far surpassing Apollo."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, everyone nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right. Someone like Alexander is the most suitable husband for Clarissa. Perhaps only he can withstand the fate power that Clarissa possesses."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At the very least, he is far superior to that waste of space, Osborne. They are not even on the same level."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We must marry Clarissa into the Paltrow family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I don't know if Clarissa's public announcement with Osborne will affect this matter. If the Paltrow family gets wind of it, they may be displeased."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugen said coldly, "So we must eliminate any future trouble! We must completely remove the impact of this matter!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, he looked at Dylan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to </span><span>Mayby</span><span> City immediately, take Clarissa away, and send her to </span><span>Dampston</span><span>! As for Osborne..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugen's voice turned icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he knows what's good for him, he will give up on Clarissa and never see her again. If he doesn't, then let him... disappear forever!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
