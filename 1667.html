  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood, Mr. Angelo Royston!" Edison replied without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly gathered a team of warriors, many of whom were in the late or peak stages of Deity Overlord, and charged toward the center of the platform.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before them, an army of over four thousand Deathborns stood in their way, launching frenzied attacks to thwart their advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their numbers alone, it would be impossible to break through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the determination on their faces remained unwavering. Just as they were about to engage the Deathborn, a terrifying surge of energy erupted behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Angelo&mdash;the power of a Deity King had been unleashed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of my way!" he roared, his voice echoing like thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ground trembled as Angelo's full force came crashing down. His mind control power struck like a whip, obliterating everything in front of him. Deathborns of every rank were torn apart, their bodies exploding in a shower of gore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, over five hundred Deathborns fell to Angelo's assault. For a brief moment, his face turned pale as the strain of such power took its toll on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to claim the Miracle Elixir, he had no choice but to push through the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone who thinks they can take the Miracle Elixir from me is seeking death!" he declared, continuing his onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He unleashed a barrage of horrifying attacks that kept the surrounding Deathborn at bay, preventing them from converging on Edison and his group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A clear path emerged before Edison and his team, free of Deathborn opposition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Charge!" Edison shouted, seizing the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, they surged forward, rushing toward the center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne, engaged in a fierce battle with the four peak Deity Overlord Deathborns, had been informed of Edison's imminent arrival by Riley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression shifted to one of alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Angelo lives up to his title as a Deity King! Surrounded by so many Deathborns, he still managed to carve out an escape for Edison's group! This is going to create some serious issues!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face hardened. "Looks like I'll need to employ some different tactics."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He considered using Spatial Clone to create several doppelgangers to deal with the Deathborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after a moment's thought, he instead grasped a beautiful sword&mdash;the Malevolence Sword!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More accurately, it was the Supreme Malevolence Sword, a weapon on par with Ultimate divine artifacts and, in some respects, even more potent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This had been his prize after killing Tobey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Supreme Malevolence Sword was an awe-inspiring weapon, its power unparalleled. Osborne had never wielded it before, yet he could already sense its raw strength. In terms of sharpness and durability, it surpassed even the Goddess of Grain's scythe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he held the Supreme Malevolence Sword, Osborne felt a sharp, invigorating energy coursing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His divine power seemed to sharpen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, this feels incredible!" he thought, excitement bubbling within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no time to waste; Osborne immediately swung the Supreme Malevolence Sword, launching his counterattack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each stroke, deadly blades of spatial energy sliced through the air. The peak Deity Overlord Deathborn standing in his way couldn't even hold up against his lethal strikes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne cleanly decapitated one Deathborn with a single sweep of his sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With electric sparks dancing around him, he activated Thunderform Flash, his speed skyrocketing as he darted behind the second Deathborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, he wielded the Supreme Malevolence Sword, unleashing a devastating arc of light that severed the creature's shoulder before sweeping upwards to take its head clean off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, only two peak Deity Overlord Deathborns remained to assault Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After wielding the Supreme Malevolence Sword, his attack power had more than doubled. There was no way these last two could withstand the onslaught!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, Osborne dispatched the last two Deathborns with swift precision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead of rushing to support Diana, he took a moment to assess the situation. He could see that Edison and his group were closing in fast. If Osborne diverted his attention to help Diana now, he wouldn't have enough time to harvest the Miracle Elixirs before they arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a determined resolve, he used his spatial power to send the Supreme Malevolence Sword directly to Diana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, hang in there! I'm going for the Miracle Elixirs!" he shouted, urgency lacing his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded, quickly grasping the Malevolence Sword. With its power now in her hands, she felt an immediate surge of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She swung the sword with renewed vigor, turning the tide of battle against the two remaining Deathborns. The energy radiating from the sword allowed her to unleash a flurry of strikes, leaving deep, horrific gashes across the Deathborn's forms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne wasted no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raced toward the towering humanoid stone figure that loomed in front of him, which stood about 164 feet tall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three Miracle Elixirs sprouted from its surface, one red, one blue, and one white.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All three Miracle Elixirs are mine!" he murmured to himself, a fierce determination igniting within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, he positioned himself at the chest of the stone, where the red Miracle Elixir, known for its ability to enhance one's realm, awaited him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its roots were thick and robust, deeply embedded into the stone, anchoring it securely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne focused his spatial power, attempting to extract the Miracle Elixir along with its roots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But to his astonishment, he found himself unable to do so.</span></p><div class="pagination">
