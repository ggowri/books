  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Strange waves erupted from the Death Sickle. They spread in the sea and quickly attacked Serena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena's pupils were shrinking violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that if she was hit by the Death Sickle again, most of her spirit and soul would be reaped. Even if she didn't die, her strength would be greatly reduced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, even Bruce would be able to defeat her easily, let alone Chris.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she couldn't hide the attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris was a psychic metahuman who had the ancient magic weapon, the Death Sickle. His strength was on the same level as Serena's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena had no way to dodge or resolve the attack and could only withstand it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she couldn't stand it anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Am I going to die here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Serena had this thought in her mind. As she looked at the smiles and confidence on Chris' and Bruce's faces, she felt very unwilling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne in the distance finally took action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't just watch Serena get seriously injured or even killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not just because Serena helped him before, but also because he knew that if Serena died, he would be the next to die, and the Maritime Auction wouldn't be able to be held smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he must save Serena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, with his current strength, he was not qualified to interfere in the fight between the three people. How could he save Serena?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Osborne thought of a way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had the Bronze Mirror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne won his bet with Alexander, and the Paltrow family gave him the Bronze Mirror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bronze Mirror was a level three ancient magic weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa said that if it had not been damaged, it would have been a level five ancient magic weapon at its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its greatest function was to resist psychic attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris was a psychic metahuman. He swung the Death Sickle to attack the opponent's mind and reap the opponent's soul. This was a psychic attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since it was a psychic attack, it would be suppressed by the Bronze Mirror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if it couldn't be completely suppressed, the Bronze Mirror could minimize the damage to Serena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So Osborne took action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He no longer cared about being exposed. He quickly opened the Dimensional Space and took out the Bronze Mirror. Then he activated it without hesitation and threw it at Serena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a burst of energy burst out from the Bronze Mirror and quickly enveloped Serena's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, Chris' psychic attacks arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bronze Mirror vibrated violently, and the crack on it instantly became much larger, but it blocked the attacks in the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the black energy was blocked by the Bronze Mirror, and only a small part of it rushed into Serena's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The little energy posed no threat to Serena at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With surprise in her eyes, Serena looked up in the direction of Osborne, wanting to see who saved her in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw Osborne, her face suddenly changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brat, why are you here? Run away now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena shouted loudly, and her face even more panicked than when she herself was in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could die but Osborne couldn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a few people knew that Osborne was Godfather's only grandson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was Godfather's only heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Godfather's maid, Serena would rather die than see Osborne die to save her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that the Bronze Mirror was useful, Osborne quickly moved and prepared to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that once he helped Serena, he would be discovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he was discovered, he would be killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He must escape immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had prepared the dimensional rift. While Serena was speaking, he had taken a step forward and walked into the dimensional rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But unfortunately, his movements were too slow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His power level was Class B+. In front of Chris and Bruce, his realm was too low.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Chris and Bruce stared at Osborne fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll kill you!" Chris shouted. "You dare to ruin my plan. Die here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Chris swung the Death Sickle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying psychic attack instantly erupted in Osborne's mind. At that moment, Osborne felt as if someone had hit his head hard with a sledgehammer, causing his mind to buzz as if lightning had exploded in his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stopped in place, and the dimensional rift that had lost control also collapsed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, his Satan's Eye suddenly emitted a cool power, which quickly soothed the vibration in Osborne's mind and made him sober up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he still spat out a mouthful of blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a little nauseous and wanted to vomit. This was the sequelae of a psychic attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he could no longer care about this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He raised his head and stared at Bruce and Chris, with a solemn expression. He couldn't escape, so what should he do next?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saved Serena, but he was going to be left here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris was surprised to see that Osborne had blocked his attack and recovered so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though it was just a casual attack, it shouldn't be something a Class B+ metahuman could withstand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bruce said coldly, "Chris, I will hold Serena back. You go and deal with that brat. Serena is very nervous. That brat must have a deep relationship with Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, he has Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is most likely the descendant of Godfather. He must be killed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Bruce's words, Chris' eyes lit up.</span></p><div class="pagination">
