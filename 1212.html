  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This isn't going to work!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't hold them back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the forces defending against the Beast Tide continued to retreat, the leaders of Hearin City's twelve Ancient Families gathered in a tense huddle, desperately seeking a solution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What on earth is the Deschanel family doing? Why haven't they made a move yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Historically, these twelve families had looked to the Deschanel family for guidance, almost like vassals. But now, anger simmered in their hearts as they watched the Deschanel family remain aloof amidst the chaos unleashed by the Beast Tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the leaders, his face grave, spoke up, "We can't stop the Beast Tide!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If this continues, we'll lose everyone to their onslaught!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of the twelve Ancient Families boasted formidable strength, with at least ten </span><span>Class S warriors and over a hundred Class AAA warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just six months ago, such power would have dwarfed most superpowers; even the Augustine family, reputed as the strongest Ancient Family in Rosmandi, could barely muster a dozen Class S warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, the energy in the world was so thin that breaking through to Class S was nearly impossible. Even the most gifted prodigies might never achieve it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Class S warriors were the elite of Blue Planet, each one a ruler in their own right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, due to the surge in energy, breaking through to Class S had become significantly easier. Anyone with a hint of talent could make that leap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, even the Ancient Families could field at least a dozen Class S warriors, and some wealthy families had several as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this dire situation, they had gathered over three hundred Class S warriors and 10 thousand Class AAA warriors&mdash;a formidable force by any standard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, they were up against an even more powerful Beast Tide, which included over 10 thousand Class S Dark Exotic Beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With such overwhelming odds, how could they possibly hold their ground? Across every battlefield, defenders were being pushed back, unable to stabilize the situation, with casualties mounting by the second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, not far away, there was one battlefield that remained surprisingly stable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a sector held by a wealthy family, guarded by just one Class S warrior and a handful of Class AAA warriors&mdash;barely a dozen. Remarkably, they had managed to hold an entire street. With the sound of gunfire echoing, every Ferocious Beast that dared to approach had already fallen before they could get close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This unexpected resilience caught the attention of the leaders of the Ancient Families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader of the Bush family exclaimed, his eyes wide with disbelief, "What's going on over there?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have over 20 Class S warriors and more than eight hundred Class AAA warriors, and we can't even hold a street! Yet they're managing it with just one Class S and a few Class AAA warriors?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shock was palpable among the gathered leaders as they turned their gazes toward the scene, their expressions a mix of astonishment and curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the midst of the turmoil, a voice broke the cacophony. "It looks like the district is being held by the Pinto family from the wealthy class! Those guns they're using&mdash;those are Draco Group's energy guns!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His revelation caused a collective gasp among the defenders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those Draco Group energy guns? I heard a few days ago that Draco Group opened up sales to the public. Even regular folks could buy them, and the price isn't even that steep. Damn, we missed out on that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard the Pinto family bought a thousand of them! And just with those, they're holding their ground like one of the Ancient Families."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We should've ordered like the Bush family too! If we had 10 thousand energy guns right now, we wouldn't be struggling so hard. We wouldn't be losing so many people."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leaders of the twelve Ancient Families were kicking themselves, regretting their decision not to invest in Draco Group's energy guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With 100 thousand energy guns, they might have stood a chance against the Beast Tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, now's not the time to dwell on the past. We need to figure out how to handle this Beast Tide! The Deschanel family has been radio silent, and even Newport City's Augustine family might take too long... Wait a minute!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speaker's eyes lit up in sudden hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We got a message from the Augustine family! They're sending reinforcements! Led by the new Godfather Osborne himself, and they'll be here soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This news sparked a wave of relief and anticipation among the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that very moment, a massive dimensional rift appeared on the outskirts of Hearin City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emerging swiftly from it was a young and imposing figure&mdash;Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind him stood 48 hundred fully armed Blood Demon members, their ranks perfectly aligned as if they were the finest soldiers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their battle-hardened presence radiated an intense fervor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The battle's really heating up," Osborne murmured, his gaze fixed on the ferocious scene ahead, his expression stern and resolute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bellowed his command, "Blood Demon, listen up! Rip those bastards apart!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
