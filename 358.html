  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be careful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other three finally reacted then. Seeing the figure being knocked away by Osborne, they all became serious. They retreated quickly and attacked Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bolt of lightning struck down instantly, hitting Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, an icy breath burst out. It was as if the whole warehouse was instantly under control. Layers of ice crystals appeared out of thin air, trying to freeze Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An invisible force entangled Osborne, making him feel like he was falling into a quagmire. His every movement required more strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned tightly at that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A lightning elemental metahuman!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An ice elemental metahuman!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mind control metahuman!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining three were all metahumans. Their strength was mighty, much stronger than Kyle and Leon he had dealt with before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had initially thought he could successfully attack two of them before they could react. But before he could even launch the second attack, the enemy launched an effective counterattack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, he had attacked one of them badly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lightning had struck Osborne's body, making crackling sounds. But Osborne was not injured at all. That man had just attacked in haste, and it was not powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the contrary, the ice elemental metahuman and the mind control metahuman imposed more significant restrictions on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought for a moment and locked onto the mind control metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mind control? I can do that, too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted, and his ocular energy flickered violently. The mind control power wrapped around him shattered in an instant, causing the mind control metahuman's expression to change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without thinking, the man quickly retreated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Osborne let him do it? He instantly launched Illusion Projection into the man's brain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the man stopped, and his eyes became temporarily blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waved his hand to tear open the space and instantly got into the dimensional rift. The next second, he appeared behind the mind control metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He punched the man hard on the back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling threatened, the man immediately woke up. But it was too late to dodge. The man only had time to turn his mind control power into a shield and block behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind control power shield was no match for Osborne's mighty power and was shattered in an instant. Osborne's heavy fist hit his back, denting it directly and blasting him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Evan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a man in black with purple eyes roared in extreme anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he waved his hand, countless lightning gathered above Osborne's head. Then, he struck Osborne like mad, as if the end of the world was coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, "I've taken care of two of you. You've already lost! None of you can escape! Do you want to strike me with lightning? Sorry. I can control lightning, too. You can't hurt me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne also waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, all the lightning above Osborne's head changed direction, bypassed his body, and struck around him without causing any damage to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man with purple eyes was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What grudge do you have against us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he was extremely shocked. It had only been ten seconds since Osborne had launched the sneak attack. But the strength and means displayed by Osborne were already making his scalp numb. He thought, "It is unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He transformed into a Vampire!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He has terrifying power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he has spatial power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could even change the direction of my lightning!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader of the Ghost Ship was utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It happened so quickly, and Osborne transformed into a Vampire at the first moment, so he hadn't recognized Osborne until now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clenched his fists and roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled coldly, "Weren't you just discussing that you must kill me? Now, I appear in front of you. How could you not recognize me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, the leader of the Ghost Ship was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He once again showed an incredible look. "You are Osborne Augustine, the heir of the Augustine family? How could it be you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why can't it be me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... How come you are so strong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader of the Ghost Ship refused to accept it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled again, "Are you starting to get scared? Are you worried that I will threaten Alexander Paltrow, the Paltrow family's heir?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Osborne's words, the man suddenly became serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know what you are talking about! I have nothing to do with the Paltrow family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged. "No matter what, I will know who you are when I get you. Stop talking nonsense. Today is the end of the Ghost Ship! You </span><span>bugs</span><span> hiding in the shadows are doomed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne attacked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the remaining two was a lightning elemental metahuman, and the other was an ice elemental metahuman. Both of them were strong, but they were still in Class A-.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All Class A- metahumans were actually losers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they were strong enough, they would not fail in their attempt to become a Class A master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Osborne now, as long as multiple Class A- metahumans did not besiege him, he was fearless. He had too many means. And when he burst out with all his strength, his opponents of the same level would be completely crushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Illusion Projection!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Attack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Illusion Projection!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Attack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Osborne seriously injured the remaining two. Their chests collapsed, and they fell to the ground, coughing up blood madly. They couldn't stand up at all, and their eyes were full of despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't expected that they would be defeated so easily.</span></p><div class="pagination">
