  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro ignored Icy Five, his life force burning rapidly as he maintained the Draconic Formation. His body felt like a funnel, draining away with each passing moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew he couldn't hold on much longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other Hudson family warriors were in similar straits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when he witnessed that the majority of the Human Alliance took advantage of the Draconic Formation they'd set up and quickly retreated behind the last line of defense in Peaks City, and saw one colossal shield after another rapidly rising above the city, Jethro finally couldn't help but heave a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "Thank goodness the Human Alliance hasn't completely fallen apart!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There's still hope for the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the protection of the last-line defensive barrier in Peaks City, the Human Community should be able to hold out for a few more days. I just hope Osborne comes back soon, resurrects the God of Light, and brings us back to life..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, he turned to Icy Five, a cold smirk on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Icy Five, don't get too cocky! Celestara belongs to the Human Community! This land protects us, and we will win this war! We will drive you invaders out for good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Five erupted into laughter, a cruel sound that echoed across the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha! You're hilarious!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even in this dire situation, you still think the Human Community stands a chance? How laughable! Your fate is sealed! The God of Light is dead&mdash;what do you have left to fight us with?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if we can't break through Peaks City today, it will fall within three days! By then, the entire Human Community will be wiped out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy Five glared at Jethro with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro didn't bother to argue further; the grim reality of their situation was undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Icy One, Icy Two, and others arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces were gloomy as they surveyed the massive dragon phantom defense wall before them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One declared coldly, "The Hudson family is asking for death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once we breach Peaks City, I'll lead the charge against the Hudson family </span><span>first </span><span>and wipe out every last one of you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro chuckled, "You won't need to go through all that trouble. All the warriors of the Hudson family are right here, and they've already unleashed the deadly forbidden technique. They won't last much longer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if we can hold you off just a little longer, allowing the Human Alliance to retreat, then every last one of us in the Hudson family will have died for a worthy cause!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One fell silent at that, contemplating Jethro's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, he finally scoffed and waved his hand. "Attack! Break their defenses and take Peaks City! Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Deity Legion surged forward, a tidal wave of destruction crashing against the dragon phantom defense wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Icy One, Icy Two, and the other two Dark Sovereigns joining in, even the dragon phantom defense wall created by million-strong Hudson family warriors couldn't hold out any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a boom, the dragon phantom wall finally shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro coughed up a mouthful of blood, his face turning as pale as a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other Hudson warriors were in the same dire condition, all of them spitting blood as the defense crumbled around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many fell to the ground, lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More Hudson warriors burned through their remaining life force, collapsing one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the dragon phantom wall fell, the human shield disintegrated, and the sight was so devastating that even the Dark Deity Legion hesitated to continue their assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stood in silence, watching as the Hudson family warriors, once proud and defiant, succumbed to the relentless drain of their life force, falling like autumn leaves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Huddled behind the last line of defense in Peaks City, the Human Alliance felt their hearts break as they watched the Hudson family warriors fall. Eyes turned red with a mixture of rage and grief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One said, "The Hudson family is a worthy opponent!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a shame!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're just foolish for sacrificing themselves for the hopeless Human Community. What a bunch of idiots!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave their bodies untouched; we can't waste time here! Go around them and attack Peaks City! We have to break down the last barrier within three days and wipe out the Human Alliance once and for all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thunderous roar of the Dark Deity Legion filled the air as billions surged forward, relentlessly assaulting the final defenses of Peaks City. The massive protective barriers shivered under their fierce onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pour power into the barrier! Hold the line!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's voice rose above the chaos, urgency lacing her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were bloodshot from the strain, not because she believed the Hudson family warriors were truly gone&mdash;she knew they could be revived once Osborne returned&mdash;but seeing them fall weighed heavily on her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it wasn't just the Hudson family; members of the Blood Demon forces had perished as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Biting her lip, she steeled herself. "We have to hold on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we can keep the Dark Deity Legion at bay for three days, hope is not lost! God of Light isn't dead; she will return in three days!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their waning spirits, the Human Alliance sprang into action, channeling energy into the barrier to keep it intact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But they had underestimated the Dark Deity Legion's power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although everyone had hoped that the final defense would last at least three days, by the second day, the barrier was already on the verge of collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Exhaustion settled over every soldier in the Human Alliance; their strength was nearly depleted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone said, "This is not </span><span>the way out</span><span>! We can't hold them off much longer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if we can't hold, we must try!" Anastasia gritted her teeth, her eyes aflame with determination. "We have to keep holding!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A leader from the Human Community spoke up, a voice dripping with cynicism, "Let's be honest here, folks. We should probably give up. God of Light is dead; God of Night isn't even showing up. Just look at us, how can we stand up to the Paramount Supreme Clan? Maybe it's time to negotiate with them. Let's surrender to the Paramount Supreme Clan; they might not kill us! We might survive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A heavy silence fell over the group, heads drooping as they mulled over his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Anastasia couldn't take it anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're all thinking about surrendering instead of standing against the Dark Deity Legion! Are you even real members of the Human Community? Do you really want to kneel before the Paramount Supreme Clan and live as their slaves?" Her anger burned bright as she locked eyes with the speaker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man, Samson Fairchild, the leader of the Glacial Bear Crew, was an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King. He was among the highest-ranked in cultivation level present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression darkened at her reproach; it stung his pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold snort, he retorted, "Watch your mouth, girl. Do you think you're in charge here? The Human Community was never a match for the Paramount Supreme Clan anyway! What's wrong with surrendering? At least that way, we won't have to die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really want to end up like the Hudson family, throwing your life away foolishly?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We in the Glacial Bear Crew have decided to surrender! And not only that, but I'll hand over the Seven Young Deity Kings from the Human Community to the Paramount Supreme Clan, to Lord Malevolence! Maybe they'll reward us for that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a mocking laugh, Samson lunged forward, aiming to seize the remaining four members of the Seven Young Deity Kings.</span></p><div class="pagination">
