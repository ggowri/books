  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor sneered and said, "What did you expect? An old man like you isn't worth our personal attention?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you've reached Ascension Three Supernal Deity King, you're still nothing but a minor obstacle to the esteemed Lord Malevolence's Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll be swallowed up and crushed in no time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the Seven Young Deity Kings of the Human Community? Now that's a different story. They've been noticed by a major player from the Paramount Supreme Clan, and we need to eliminate them ASAP!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unfortunately, you lot have been holed up lately, cranking up the power on your divine power shield to the max, making it nearly impossible for us to breach your defenses. So, we had to lie in wait for you instead. But look at us now&mdash;we succeeded!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold smile crept across Trevor's face. He continued, "Now, tell us where the Seven Young Deity Kings are hiding! Especially their leader, Theodore. That esteemed figure from the Paramount Supreme Clan has listed him on the hit list, and he's as good as dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just tell us where Theodore is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor's expression darkened as divine power surged around him, crystallizing into countless ice blades that hovered ominously above Jethro's head. With a mere thought, those blades could plunge down and end Jethro's life in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Jethro couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A major player from the Paramount Supreme Clan wants to take out the Seven Young Deity Kings of the Human Community? You want to kill Theodore? Ha! You're dreaming! Want to know where they are? I could tell you, but it won't do you any good... They're currently at the Sanctum of Light!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The esteemed God of Light values them highly and has decided to personally mentor them! If you want to take out the Seven Young Deity Kings, you'll have to go to the Sanctum of Light!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Jethro wore a look of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor frowned. "Sanctum of Light?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bram scoffed and said, "Impossible! The Seven Young Deity Kings can't be at the Sanctum of Light!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro retorted, "Oh really, Bram? How do you know it's impossible? Don't you think the strength and potential the Seven Young Deity Kings have shown would warrant the esteemed God of Light's personal attention?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bram retorted, "Hmph! I say it's impossible, so it is! Jethro, don't even think about trying to deceive us or struggle against us! Since you're being uncooperative, we'll have to resort to more... persuasive methods! We'll make you talk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Bram produced a vial from his hand, the contents of which were unknown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro's brow furrowed as he sensed the danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bram grinned. "Jethro, this is a special potion. Once you drink it, you'll become my puppet, obedient to my every command! You'll spill the beans on the Seven Young Deity Kings and even confess to things like wetting the bed when you were three! If you won't cooperate, then don't blame me for what comes next!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Bram approached, Jethro's eyes widened in shock and panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a deep breath, determination flashing across his face. "Bram, you think you can use that on me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Turn me into your puppet? You're dreaming!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'd rather die than let you succeed! Self-destruct!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce shout, Jethro chose to detonate his Divine Body and powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew there was no way to escape&mdash;Bram was an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King, and even at his peak, Jethro wouldn't stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, after being ambushed and severely injured, he had only one option left: self-destruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only in death could he protect the secrets in his mind and prevent Bram from discovering Osborne and the others' whereabouts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To safeguard Osborne, he made the ultimate sacrifice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a tempest of power surged through Jethro, wildly swirling around him like an untamed storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face flushed bright red, resembling a boiled lobster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying force was brewing, like a nuclear bomb on the brink of detonation, ready to unleash chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Crap!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bram and Trevor hadn't anticipated that Jethro would resort to self-destruction so readily. After all, he was an Ascension Three Supernal Deity King&mdash;a being with an exceptionally long lifespan. Why would he throw it all away like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You lunatic!" Bram cursed, instinctively pulling Trevor back as they stumbled away in a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A self-destructing Ascension Three Supernal Deity King was no joke. Even if Bram was an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King, he risked being severely injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back up!" they shouted, retreating hastily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Jethro was beyond reason now. Having made his choice, he wouldn't let Bram and Trevor escape. If he was going down, he'd make sure they went with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bram! Trevor! You traitors to the Human Community! You're both going to hell with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce roar, Jethro charged at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body and divine power ignited, propelling him forward with unimaginable speed. In an eye blink, he closed the distance to Bram and Trevor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bram's face paled in shock as they realized the imminent danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbeknownst to them, a figure appeared right where Jethro had stood moments before, teleporting in using the Binding Twin Pearl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had sensed the dramatic shift in Jethro's energy and rushed over, only to witness his grandfather, ablaze with chaotic power, sprinting after Bram and Trevor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of dread washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Self-destruct! Grandfather is going to self-destruct!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's brows knitted together as he realized he was out of time. Jethro had fully ignited his Divine Body and powers, and there was no way to stop the explosion now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! But I still have time!" Osborne muttered under his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A plan formed as he quickly cast absolute guardianship, duplicating Jethro's life essence in a heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that done, he let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Jethro's explosion commenced!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body erupted like a massive explosion, releasing a force akin to a nuclear blast that sent a massive mushroom cloud billowing into the sky, engulfing Bram and Trevor within its chaotic wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You madman! You're absolutely insane!" Bram shouted, feeling the full force of Jethro's self-destruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting his teeth, he shoved Trevor in front of him, turning him into a makeshift shield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trevor's eyes widened, panic flooding through him as he realized the futility of their situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tremendous force hurled them through the air, both of them spitting blood as they crashed hard into the ground, creating a huge crater upon impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bram, being stronger and using Trevor as a human shield, fared slightly better. After coughing up some blood mixed with bits of flesh, he managed to regain a significant portion of his energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In stark contrast, Trevor was a broken mess, his body reduced to a ragdoll state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But somehow, he was still alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bram gripped Trevor tightly and lifted him into the air, preparing to flee back to the Baxter family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's when he caught sight of a pair of chilling eyes fixed on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Osborne!</span></p><div class="pagination">
