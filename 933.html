  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood there, momentarily dumbfounded, struck by the sheer potency of the blood energy he had just unleashed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "This... this is incredible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be the influence of the Dark Deity? All this blood energy is derived from his essence, which is far more advanced and robust. It's no wonder the Blood Demon members have all surged in strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The excitement surged within him as he continued to contemplate, "If I could bring down a few more Dark Deities and absorb their blood energy, I could elevate all five thousand of these fighters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who knows? Maybe I could even push them all to Class AAA! Or even Class S?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shiver ran down his spine at the thought. "Imagine five thousand Class AAA warriors!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd decimate the Aberrants without breaking a sweat, crush the League of Divine Descent, and wipe the floor with almost any superpower out there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And five thousand Class S?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that were the case, I could conquer the world without lifting a finger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that's almost impossible...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'd have to take down dozens of Dark Deities to achieve that. How could anyone do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaking his head to dispel those outlandish thoughts, Osborne called out, "Everyone, on your feet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, all the Blood Demon members snapped to attention, their eyes gleaming with fervor as they looked up at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After this massive power boost, they regarded Osborne with a reverence that bordered on worship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Report, First!" Osborne commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine!" First stepped forward, voice ringing with authority. "The Blood Demon assembly is complete! Out of five thousand two hundred nine members, all five thousand two hundred nine are present and accounted for!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Awaiting your orders, Mr. Augustine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's heart swelled with pride as he observed First.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the strongest among the Blood Demon members, a true powerhouse radiating Class AAA energy and teetering on the edge of Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several others, like Second and Third, displayed similar levels of strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "Perhaps I should provide them with even more blood energy to help them level up to Class S. However, their advancement shouldn't outpace mine. I have to reach Class S before they can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sighed, reflecting that he would have to exercise a bit of patience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After surveying the assembled warriors like a general inspecting his troops, he made his voice clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First, Second, Third. I need you to mobilize immediately. Head to the coastal provinces of Skyefall, Dampston, Tyrisland, and others at maximum speed. We've got to rescue the members of the Draco Armed Services Branch and confront the Aberrants!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Show no mercy when you encounter any Aberrant forces!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His command ignited a spark of excitement among the troops; their faces were alight with fervor and anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian had trained them explicitly for this moment, and now the opportunity to take action was finally at hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, they sprang into action, equipping themselves with weapons and swiftly boarding transport planes headed for the coastal strongholds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was worth noting that every member of the Blood Demon organization was now armed with energy weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the super energy pistols remained in limited supply&mdash;only the strongest, like First and Second, possessed them&mdash;each fighter had access to lighter energy weapons, which they wielded with proficiency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "Don't underestimate those energy guns. Sure, one might only be able to injure a Class AA enemy at best, and they're a bit weak against Class AAA powerhouses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But on the battlefield? If you've got dozens or even hundreds of these weapons firing in unison, they can create an impenetrable wall of fire. Not even a Class AAA fighter could stand their ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's either run or face certain death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when used alongside super energy pistols, even an average Class S might think twice before stepping into the line of fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Make no mistake: the Blood Demon's power right now is more than a match for the Draco Armed Services Branch. In fact, they might even be stronger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne urged, gathering Serena and the others, "Let's go; we should move! The Blood Demon members will take some time to arrive by transport, but we can get there first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He planned to use interdimensional travel to get them there quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his current capabilities, covering over 600 miles with five people in tow wasn't going to be tough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The five women stood momentarily stunned, their minds reeling from the sheer magnitude of the Blood Demon members. It wasn't until Osborne called them back to reality that they began to snap out of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a mix of admiration and apprehension in their eyes, they looked at him but didn't voice their thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, they followed Osborne into the dimensional rift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a series of ten interdimensional jumps, they finally arrived at Skyefall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they stepped out of the rift, Osborne instinctively felt the violent currents of battle nearby.</span></p><div class="pagination">
