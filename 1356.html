  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow's expression was charged with excitement. "An unusual spatial fluctuation?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you tap into it? If it really leads to a dimensional portal to </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, we could return home!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Star's eyes lit up with anticipation, echoing Divine Shadow's eagerness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of them longed to return to </span><span>Celestara</span><span>. Their realms had reached the pinnacle of Transcendent Deity, but the incomplete rules of Blue Planet prevented them from advancing further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, </span><span>Celestara</span><span> was their true home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Blue Planet had originated from it, it felt like a mere shadow of what they remembered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They yearned to see their old home, even if it had turned into ruins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nostalgia was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could sense their urgency and hope, which made him furrow his brows in concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about I give it a shot?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could feel the peculiar spatial fluctuations in this area, and deep within the fabric of space, he sensed energy waves that hinted at another world lying just beyond reach. This was indeed the closest spot to that world from Blue Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne didn't know if he could successfully open a dimensional portal between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quick, try it now!" Divine Shadow urged, her voice brimming with hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, Osborne pooled all his spatial power. Here, at this convergence point, the two worlds drew near to one another&mdash;yet the actual distance between them could still be unfathomably vast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with his space elemental essence already at Level Six, he felt uncertain about his ability to create a dimensional portal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew he could only try his best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a hum, the space in front of Osborne began to tremble violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dimensional portal swirled open, stretching deep into the energy-laden abyss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his astonishment, the portal quickly extended to an impressive 600 miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grinding his teeth, he pushed harder, determined to unleash more of his spatial abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression hardened as he realized that stretching the portal to 6000 miles was pushing him to his limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hidden realm grew clearer, but the portal still didn't connect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't back down!" he exclaimed, clenching his jaw and pressing on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sweat formed on his forehead as he strained to open the portal further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twelve thousand miles was as far as he could go, and despite his efforts, the connection to the other side seemed just out of reach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This isn't happening!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's complexion paled, and fatigue threatened to overwhelm him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at Divine Shadow and God of Star, who were watching with palpable disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it really hopeless? Ugh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They both sighed, their excitement deflating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing their disappointment, Osborne felt a pang in his chest. He resolved to give it one final shot. "Grandma Divine Shadow, God of Star, I can still sense that world hidden in the depths of space! It's not that far away; it's just my power that's lacking. Let me try one more time. If it doesn't work this time, we'll have to set it aside for now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination, Osborne summoned the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Channel the strength!" he commanded, connecting through the roots of the Lotus, calling on the immense power of the hundreds of thousands who had just been transformed into the Blood Clan from the Pantheon League.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Osborne's power surged dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Pantheon League, with over a hundred thousand members&mdash;including three </span><span>thousand five hundred God-realm warriors and other masters of Class A or above&mdash;was a force to be reckoned with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their combined strength, though perhaps not equal to that of the Blood Demon members who were all Intermediate Deities or higher, was nothing to scoff at. As they channeled their power to Osborne, his realm soared from the early stages of Superior Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he reached the Superior Deity realm, Osborne's power surge showed no signs of slowing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rocketed from the early stages to the mid-stages and finally peaked in Superior Deity before crossing the threshold into Transcendent Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he entered the Transcendent Deity realm, Osborne continued to push his limits, only coming to a halt when he reached the mid-stages of this formidable domain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, he unleashed his spatial power, and the dimensional portal stretched deeper into the fabric of space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The length of the portal continued to expand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, it reached a staggering 90 thousand miles into the depths of space, pushing its limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, it still hadn't bridged the two worlds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Osborne could vividly sense the other world&mdash;its vastness and grandeur far beyond anything Blue Planet could offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That must be </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, sealed away in the depths of the Dimensional Space by the God of Space!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
