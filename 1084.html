  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo shouted desperately at Armstrong, his voice laced with urgency. He was even willing to trade the technology for creating Class S clones using the bodies of deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armstrong was his last hope!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Armstrong left him now, Gerardo knew he would only suffer more injuries, eventually succumbing to Osborne's relentless attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't bear the thought of dying just yet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the face of death, everything else paled in comparison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words made Armstrong halt in his tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The expression on Armstrong's face shifted through a spectrum of emotions&mdash;hesitation, conflict. On the surface, he looked down on Gerardo's cloning technology, dismissing it as a mere trick, but deep down, he felt a stirring of desire for it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ordinary cloning techniques were child's play for the League of Divine Descent; they could accomplish that with ease. But cloning Class S beings? That was an entirely different ballgame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they learned that Gerardo had managed to clone nearly a thousand Class S individuals, he received orders from the Wise Order of the League of Divine Descent to acquire that technology at any cost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the League of Divine Descent could master such a technique, their power would soar, far surpassing anything the Aberrants could muster!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the League of Divine Descent had access to more divine remains than Gerardo ever could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could potentially clone tens of thousands of Class S beings, making them the undisputed rulers of Blue Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who could stand against them then?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Court of the Sun?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Prophet Alliance?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Eityreia Organization?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They would be mere footnotes in history, easily obliterated by the League of Divine Descent's might!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That thought was tantalizing, and Armstrong felt the allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, as he glanced at Osborne, who was mercilessly beating Gerardo, doubt crept in. Osborne was a formidable opponent, and even if he teamed up with Gerardo, could they really hope to defeat him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Class S cloning technology was tempting, but not at the cost of his life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Armstrong hesitated, Gerardo's injuries worsened, and panic surged through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted again, "Armstrong, what are you waiting for? If you think the Class S cloning technology isn't enough, I have a formula for the Young Godling Cultivation Serum! It can double the physical strength of anyone under fifty! I can give that to you too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The reason this guy is so strong is that he used my Godling Cultivation Serum! Once you have that formula, the younger generation of the League of Divine Descent will undergo a transformation, becoming incredibly powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, the League of Divine Descent will be unbeatable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just want to live! Help me take him down, and I promise I'll share both the Class S cloning technology and the Godling Cultivation Serum with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's desperate plea lit a fire in Armstrong's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His breath quickened at the mention of the Class S cloning technology and the Godling Cultivation Serum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll do this!" Armstrong made his decision in an instant, but he didn't act immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He called out to Gerardo, "I don't trust you. You need to share the Class S cloning technology and the Godling Cultivation Serum with me first, via telepathy. Only then will I step in to take him down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo smirked, saying, "Not a chance! If I give it to you now, what's to stop you from running away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armstrong frowned. "Then give me one of them first. Once I save you, you can share the other!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deal!" Gerardo agreed, desperation overriding his reluctance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was on the brink of collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo exclaimed with urgency, "I'll give you the formula for the Godling Cultivation Serum first! The formula is..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could switch to telepathy, the words spilled out of him. He spoke loudly and clearly, ensuring not just Armstrong but also Osborne could hear every syllable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armstrong's expression hardened instantly, concern replacing his earlier bravado.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo couldn't help but smirk, sensing the advantage. "Now Osborne knows the formula, too, Armstrong! If you don't help me get rid of him, you and your League of Divine Descent won't get to monopolize this technology!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once Osborne kills me, he'll utilize the Godling Cultivation Serum to boost the Augustine family's strength, and then they'll come after you guys!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armstrong snorted, irritation creeping into his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gerardo, don't try any tricks! I promised I'd help you take him down as soon as I had the formula. You can count on me to keep my word!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I expect you to share the Class S cloning technology after we deal with him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At those words, Gerardo's eyes lit up with a glimmer of hope. "You can count on me! I'm a man of my word. Just get rid of him, and I'll hand over the Class S cloning tech to you! Hurry up; I'm running out of time here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath to steady himself, Armstrong nodded resolutely. "Don't worry; together, we'll make short work of him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Armstrong unleashed a burst of radiant energy that radiated from his body like a miniature sun. He expertly directed the beams of light toward Osborne's form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression shifted to one of alarm as he realized the impending danger.</span></p><div class="pagination">
