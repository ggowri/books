  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, come forth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne spoke, the surroundings erupted into chaos. Figures darted out from nowhere, multiplying rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, the Blood Demon members who had been training within Haven's Hope responded instantly to Osborne's command, initiating dimensional portals to emerge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, over four thousand eight hundred Blood Demon members materialized around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, three hundred had already ascended to the Deity King tier, while the rest were Deity Overlords at the peak of their power, poised to break through into Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they stood in perfect alignment, their combined auras surged upwards, creating an atmosphere that was both intimidating and awe-inspiring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this was only the beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next came Osborne's Spatial Clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time he had unleashed his Spatial Clones in full force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, powerful clones coalesced before their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having mastered the seventh level of Spatial Clone, Osborne commanded sixty-four clones in total.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each clone possessed around fifty percent of Osborne's full strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their sudden appearance sent Hubery and the others into a state of shock, foreboding sinking deep into their hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, this was not the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne immediately invoked the Undead Cataclysm, summoning Dark Undead entities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his current might, each Dark Undead he conjured was equivalent to a Deity Overlord in the late stage or even at the peak of their power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their numbers were staggering&mdash;mounting up to one million Dark Undeads swarmed around Hubery and his group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They cast a darkness that was both malevolent and fearsome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery and his companions were utterly stunned by this turn of events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery let out a startled cry, refusing to believe what he was seeing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He exclaimed, disbelief coloring his voice, "Undead Cataclysm?! This is the Undead Cataclysm! Only the revered Lord Malevolence was said to have mastered it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you presume to wield it? And to summon a million Dark Undeads? You've taken the Undead Cataclysm to the seventh level? It's impossible! Absolutely impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This must be an illusion! Some trickery!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery roared, refusing to accept the reality unfolding before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments ago, he had led more than five hundred Deity King warriors, encircling Osborne, certain of Osborne's demise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the blink of an eye, the tables had turned. Now, it was Hubery and his entourage who found themselves surrounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What encircled them was a formidable force, Osborne's sixty-four Spatial Clones, over four thousand eight hundred Blood Demon members, and one million Dark Undeads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, everyone sucked in a sharp breath, their eyes wide with panic and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being Deity King-level warriors, many of them in the mid to late stages of Deity King level, the million Dark Undeads surrounding them still made their legs go weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And to make matters worse, there were three hundred Blood Demon members who had also reached the Deity King level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not to mention Osborne's sixty-four Spatial Clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This force was more than capable of wiping out their five hundred Deity King warriors right here and now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could they not be terrified?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's bodies were tense, divine power bursting forth in defensive auras, their vigilance at an all-time high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, felt somewhat drained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Conjuring sixty-four Spatial Clones while summoning a million Dark Undeads was a massive drain on his divine and soul power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't care; he just sneered at Hubery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne taunted, "Hubery, do you still think I can't take you down here? Who's really on the brink of death now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I remember you saying that with so many of you, one spit from each of you could drown me. Well, I'll return that back! With so many of us, a single spit from each could drown you all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face was smug with arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's face turned beet red with rage. "You lowly, despicable human! Do you really think this can kill me? So what if you have more people? The gap in our levels is too vast. Your Spatial Clones, your Dark Undead, no matter how many, can't touch me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for those blood-robed folks, having three hundred Deity King-level warriors among them is impressive! But they've all just recently broken into Deity King level. They can't threaten me either! I can fight my way out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his words, Hubery's expression remained grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words were more for self-reassurance, a way to boost his own confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded and said, "You're right. If all of you try to escape with everything you've got, these arrangements alone won't be enough to wipe you all out. At least, some of you might find a way to slip away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery's expression relaxed somewhat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, continued, "But since that's the case, I'll have to pull out a few more tricks! Time to borrow some power!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
