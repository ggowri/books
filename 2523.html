  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Trenton's words, Hamilton immediately became furious. "Trenton, what do you mean by this? I&rsquo;ve already given you all the Dragon Elixirs. You hid the Dragon Elixirs yourself, yet you accuse me of tricking you. Are you trying to break your promise?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, both Hamilton and Trenton felt the other was playing tricks on them, as they couldn't see Drum and naturally wouldn't think a third party was present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Trenton thought Hamilton didn&rsquo;t want to give him the Dragon Elixirs, while Hamilton believed Trenton wanted to kill them after obtaining the Dragon Elixirs. Instantly, they were both furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hamilton, you're courting death. How dare you play tricks on me. Do you really think I won't kill you all? I can kill you all and then extract the Dragon Elixirs from you," Trenton roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hamilton shouted, "Trenton, you're courting death. You took my Dragon Elixirs and still want to kill us. We're not people you can bully at will. Everyone, let's fight them! Even if we die, we won't let them have it easy. Kill them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the two sides, who were about to cease fire, erupted into an even fiercer battle. This time, both sides aimed to completely annihilate the other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation made Osborne very satisfied, thinking, "Go on and keep fighting. Once you're almost done, I'll come out to clean up the battlefield. As long as the Frenetic Storm Warband members aren't all killed, I'm in no rush."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne continued to watch the battle leisurely from the sidelines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hamilton, Trenton, Dominic, and Ronald, at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, were much stronger than the Illusionary Heavenly Demon at the same level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the very least, they all possessed numerous Sacred Artifacts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their battle unleashed incredibly terrifying power, but fortunately, the black mist of the Phantomagic Realm had a special force that prevented the aftermath from spreading too far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, two more members of the Frenetic Storm Warband were killed. Their strength couldn't match that of Trenton, Dominic, and Ronald. If this continues, everyone in the Frenetic Storm Warband will inevitably be wiped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation made Hamilton even angrier. "Trenton, I'll fight you to the end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Hamilton began burning his blood essence. Flames surged around him, instantly making his aura much stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Originally, Hamilton and Trenton were evenly matched, unable to kill each other. But as Hamilton burned his blood essence, Trenton immediately fell into a disadvantage. After being struck in the chest by Hamilton's Sacred Artifact, he coughed up blood while flying backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hamilton, you're crazy!" Trenton was shocked. "You actually burned your blood essence? Aren't you afraid of falling into a weakened state and then dying in the Phantomagic Realm?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing his words, Hamilton snarled, "You want to kill us. If I don't fight with everything I've got, should I just let you kill me? I told you, if you dare break your promise, I won't let you off even if I die. Everyone, start burning your blood essence now. We're going to fight them to the end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone in the Frenetic Storm Warband went berserk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The remaining twenty or so people all began burning their blood essence. Their strength instantly increased significantly. Although Dominic and Ronald had higher cultivation levels, they couldn't withstand these frenzied opponents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, the weakest Ronald was sent flying, a massive bloody hole appearing in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Hamilton charged at Trenton again. "Trenton, die! As long as I kill you, I can take back all my Dragon Elixir. I can also get your Dragon Elixir. Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, Trenton was sent flying again, severely injured. Half of his body was nearly shattered. If this continues, he will surely die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Trenton became even angrier and roared, "Hamilton, you truly deserve to die. Do you think you're the only one who can burn blood essence? Today, let's see if you kill me or if I kill all of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Trenton also began burning his blood essence, and his strength started to surge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, he was already injured before. Even if he burned his blood essence now, he still couldn't defeat Hamilton and was completely overpowered by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dominic, Ronald, burn your blood essence too. Finish off your opponents quickly and come help me," Trenton could only shout to his two companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Dominic and Ronald also realized something was wrong. Although reluctant, they had no choice but to burn their blood essence, hoping to end the fight quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Osborne couldn't help but laugh, thinking, "This is perfect. Burning blood essence may give them greater power for a short time, but they'll soon fall into a weakened state. Then, I can deal with them more easily."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The following situation was pretty much as Osborne expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With everyone burning their blood essence, the Frenetic Storm Warband clashed even more fiercely with the three from the Wolfen Trinity Guild. Soon, over a dozen members of the Frenetic Storm Warband were killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this point, only Hamilton and five advanced Empyrean Sacredness warriors remained in the Frenetic Storm Warband, while Trenton, Dominic, and Ronald's injuries worsened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If this continues, the Frenetic Storm Warband will still be defeated. In the end, Hamilton will also be killed by Trenton and the other two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne knew it was time to act, thinking, "Only six members of the Frenetic Storm Warband are left. They can't die. The aftereffects of burning blood essence have already set in. Their energy is fading fast."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go, Flash," Osborne ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Flash carried Osborne swiftly toward the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Hamilton and Trenton were both insanely furious, holding on with sheer willpower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, neither of them noticed Osborne approaching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne drew the Bloodwrought Bow from a distance and unleashed the powerful Heaven Arrow, targeting Trenton, who was fighting Hamilton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, the arrow shot out, instantly reaching Trenton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Trenton was already very weak and in the midst of an intense battle. By the time he realized something was wrong, it was too late. Although he tried his best to defend, he was still a step too slow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, the terrifying Heaven Arrow shattered Trenton's body, completely killing the already severely injured and extremely weak Trenton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, countless Sacred Power Arrows appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After killing Trenton, Osborne didn&rsquo;t hesitate and immediately unleashed the Earth Arrow's Arrow Storm. In an instant, tens of thousands of powerful Sacred Power Arrows engulfed Dominic and Ronald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No!" they roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Dominic and Ronald's strength and physical condition were at their peak, Osborne's Earth Arrow, even the Arrow Storm, wouldn't have caused them serious injuries, let alone killed them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, because they had burned their blood essence, they were in a weakened state. Moreover, they were already seriously injured before and couldn't possibly withstand the Arrow Storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, a terrifying explosion erupted. In an instant, Dominic and Ronald were completely dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After finishing all this, Osborne stopped attacking and quickly appeared in front of Hamilton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He stared at Hamilton, his eyes filled with coldness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was actually a bit nervous at this moment, thinking, "I've finally found him. I'm finally about to know if my parents are still alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Hamilton was already stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked at Osborne, then felt Osborne's indifference, and immediately became nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said calmly, "I won't kill you now. Surrender."</span></p><div class="pagination">
