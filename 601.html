  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm just going to the dungeon to find you an opponent," Matthew said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aresta was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go to the dungeon?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Does he want to find me an opponent?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that the Augustines still had a hidden expert locked away in their dungeon? Impossible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aresta let out a sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They dared to challenge the Augustines, so they must have done their research. The only young talents worth their attention were a select few.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the main bloodline, there were Emma and Owen. From the branch bloodline, there was Lance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to their investigation, only these three had the strength to rival a Yalynch Godson. The others, including Sam and David, were not worth considering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aresta scoffed, "Find whoever you want! As long as they're from the younger generation of the Augustines, anyone will do. Just don't keep me waiting too long!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew smirked, "Just wait. This will give you some time to recover."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Matthew quickly left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustines were all confused, wondering who Matthew was going to find in the dungeon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be... Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, someone guessed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, after all, was the champion of the Branch Bloodline Competition. Though he hasn't fought Lance, he did genuinely overpower Sam."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, if there's anyone qualified to step onto the ring, it's probably only Osborne! He's currently locked in the dungeon, put there by Matthew himself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unexpectedly, just a day later, Matthew's going to invite Osborne out personally."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd buzzed with rapid discussions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph, what's the use of inviting Osborne out? His strength is barely enough to suppress Sam, and Aresta defeats Sam in one move!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen sneered at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although Aresta is injured, Osborne is definitely no match for him. Even if Osborne is brought out, he'll only last a few more moves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Owen finished speaking, Lance also frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't think inviting Osborne out at this point would be helpful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides Aresta, the Rosenthal family still had three Godson who hadn't appeared yet. Even if their strength weren't as good as Aresta's, it wouldn't be much weaker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they were all Godson, the top young powerhouses of the younger generation in Yalynch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, let alone Osborne, even if Emma stepped into the ring again, it would be challenging to turn the tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Augustine family has lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd felt a sense of despair, unable to imagine how the Augustine family could turn things around in such an unfavorable situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Rosenthal family, on the other hand, were incredibly relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all felt that the duel was over, and they had won a great victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were already speculating which two divine artifacts Godfather would give them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Everett was looking at the Godfather with a playful expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sebastian, my Rosenthal family is going to win this battle. You better prepare the two divine artifacts quickly. I won't be polite to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Godfather looked at him calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everett, the battle isn't over yet. Even if you win now, it's too early to celebrate. The Augustine family still has one more spot to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps I'll be the one who wins in the end."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Everett burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sebastian, I didn't expect you to be so naive! The Augustine family can barely scrape together enough people to fight, and now you're dreaming of a comeback?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you're willing to waste time, I'll humor you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Everett looked at Godfather with a playful expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Godfather's expression remained calm, giving no hint of his thoughts. He simply waited in silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Matthew had arrived at the dungeon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pushing open the heavy dungeon door, Matthew took a deep breath. "I really didn't want to come to this forsaken place! And to have to personally ask&nbsp;that guy&nbsp;to come out and fight for the Augustines!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I had known this would happen, I wouldn't have locked him up yesterday."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Muttering to himself, Matthew stepped into the dungeon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly reached Osborne's cell. In the pitch-black darkness, Matthew couldn't see a thing. He pulled out a particular ancient artifact, and a faint light finally illuminated the dungeon, casting a glow around his body and dispelling the oppressive silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the light of the ancient magic weapon, he looked into the cell and jumped back in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was staring right at him, his eyes gleaming in the darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You startled me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You knew I was coming?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew entered the cell. The ancient magic weapon's light bathed both him and Osborne, and the world seemed to return to normal. Their voices echoed in the confined space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow. "I had a feeling you'd come looking for me, and that you'd ask me to leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew froze, touching his nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can also predict the future. Do you think I'll believe you? But it seems you're in good shape. Hurry up and pack your things. Let's leave this hellhole. You're free."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't move. He said calmly, "I'm not leaving! You want to lock me up, and you lock me up. You want to let me out, you let me out? There's no such thing as a free lunch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think this place is not wrong. I'm comfortable here. I like it here. I think I'll stay here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew heard this and looked anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this hellhole not bad? Do you like this hellhole? Osborne, you haven't gone crazy after just one day, have you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shrugged, too lazy to pay attention to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew Matthew's purpose in coming to find him, but he wasn't going to leave quickly. At the very least, he would make Matthew pay a price.</span></p><div class="pagination">
