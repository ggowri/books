Every member of the Hudson family had had their life essence replicated by Osborne, meaning even if they died on the battlefield, Osborne could bring them back to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under such circumstances, he had nothing to fear, and neither did the Hudson family warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing God of Light's question, he confidently replied, "Please rest assured, God of Light. While I can't promise absolute success, we're at least seventy to eighty percent confident. The Hudson warriors will do their best to secure victory!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he finished speaking, everyone around looked at him in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't understand why Jethro was so confident. Could a team composed entirely of Hudson warriors really win in the arena?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the past two days, even the alliances formed by the brightest talents from various factions had lost!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jethro, don't gamble with the future of the Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian sneered as he spoke, "Our Human Community has just achieved two consecutive victories. Now's the time to capitalize on that momentum and go for a third win! Are you sure your Hudson warriors have what it takes to secure this one for us?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you break our winning streak, you'll be the greatest sinner of the Human Community! I think it's better to let the elite talents from the Sanctum of Light continue fighting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Jethro shot a cold glare at Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Julian, if you're so confident, why don't you send someone from your HeartUnited Alliance to fight? Otherwise, shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian was furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian was an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King, while Jethro had just broken through to the Ascension Three. Furthermore, the HeartUnited Alliance was one of the top three Dukedom Level Powers in the Human Community, while the Hudson family was at the bottom of the rankings. In terms of both strength and status, Julian was on a whole other level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, Jethro actually dared to talk to him like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's anger exploded as he unleashed his divine power, a terrifying aura pressing down on Jethro.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro's expression changed immediately, his face going pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a figure stepped in front of Jethro, shielding him from the oppressive aura while fixing a cold, piercing gaze on Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes glinted with a chilling light as he said coldly, "Julian, is it? Trying to suppress my grandfather with your aura? Who gave you that courage? Do you have a death wish?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne finished speaking, Julian froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others around them were equally stunned, looking at Osborne in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was actually threatening Julian?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian was an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was only at the Ascension One!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap between them was four entire levels&mdash;a difference as vast as heaven and earth. No one could have expected Osborne, just an Ascension One Supernal Deity King, to confront Julian and even dare to threaten him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian froze for a moment, then became furious, as if he had just been deeply insulted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're the one seeking death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You ignorant brat! Do you think that just because you've broken through to become a Supernal Deity King, you're on the same level as me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't know your place!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're no better than an ant. If I wanted to crush you, one finger would be enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's rage erupted, and an even more terrifying aura pressed down on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Osborne seemed completely unfazed, replying coldly, "One finger to crush me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then go ahead and try!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne didn't back down. Instead, he took step after step toward Julian, looking eager and ready to fight at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene left everyone stunned again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne... was he really about to fight?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he actually dare to make a move?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Julian's words were an exaggeration&mdash;he couldn't literally crush Osborne with one finger&mdash;it was undeniable that someone of Julian's level could easily eliminate an Ascension One Supernal Deity King like Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was Osborne actively courting death?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's what everyone thought, yet Osborne's expression remained calm, showing no fear at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian was indeed an Ascension Five Supernal Deity King, an incredibly powerful figure&mdash;but Osborne wasn't afraid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could Julian really be stronger than Icy Nine?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While they were both Ascension Five Supernal Deity Kings, Cold Nine was one of the Nine Dark Sovereigns. If Icy Nine wanted to take Julian down, it wouldn't be difficult at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Icy Nine... had died at Osborne's hands!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian had repeatedly provoked and insulted Osborne's grandfather, Jethro, and Osborne wasn't about to let it slide!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It looked like Osborne and Julian were about to clash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, God of Light finally spoke. She said coldly to Julian, "Julian, watch your words and actions! No matter what, it is my decision that the Hudson warriors will fight in this battle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To question the Hudson family is to question me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's more, the Hudson warriors are putting their lives on the line to win glory for the Human Community! Even if you distrust them, that doesn't give you the right to spout nonsense or humiliate them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it happens again, I won't let it go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as God of Light finished speaking, a terrifying aura descended upon Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's face turned pale, and his body began to tremble slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, he had used his aura to suppress Jethro.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, God of Light chose to use the same method, letting him experience what it was like to be suppressed by a higher-level powerhouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The difference was... when Julian had suppressed Jethro, Osborne had stepped forward to confront him directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now that he was the one being suppressed... no one dared to stand up for him, no one to confront God of Light on his behalf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, he had no choice but to lower his proud head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Light, I... I understand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian gritted his teeth as he spoke, though a trace of defiance and coldness flickered in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing him relent, God of Light withdrew her oppressive aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough! The third match is about to begin. Stop the infighting and focus on the arena!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After God of Light spoke, everyone turned their attention to the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the platform, ten thousand Hudson warriors at the peak of the Deity Overlord Level had already spread out evenly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stared in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spreading out at the start? Aren't they afraid of being picked off one by one?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are the Hudson warriors planning to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was focused on the arena, except for Osborne, who felt a cold gaze fixated on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was coming from Julian!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned his head, meeting Julian's icy glare with an equally cold look. Their eyes locked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Julian's frosty voice echoed in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kid, you got lucky today!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But don't think for a second that just because God of Light is protecting you, you can act all high and mighty! The moment she's not around, if I see you, I'll teach you a lesson you'll never forget!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll show you what happens when you provoke me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll crush you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle. He sent a mental message back. "Oh really? Then I'll be waiting for you! Just make sure it's not you who regrets running into me elsewhere!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne ignored him and turned his attention to the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The third battle had begun.</span></p><div class="pagination">
