  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne wasn't about to let his recent triumph cloud his judgment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Guy was just a leader of ten thousand, and in the Wild Flame Army, there were at least fifty of them. With his current strength, he might manage to take on two leaders of ten thousand, but any more than that would be pushing his luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, above the leaders were twenty vice generals and ten generals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Beyond them stood three deputy commanders and the most powerful of all&mdash;the commander himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From what Osborne understood, all the vice generals were at least at the early to mid stages of Deity Overlord, with some leaders of ten thousand also being Deity Overlord warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The generals, on the other hand, boasted late-stage Deity Overlord strength, if not peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The three deputy commanders and the commander were all Deity King warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This meant that any general from the Wild Flame Army would be far beyond Osborne's current capabilities. Even if he unleashed all his power, defeating one would be an uphill battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, instead of focusing on converting more Wild Flame Army members into Blood Clan, he needed to think about boosting his own strength. Once he was stronger, he could devise a plan to transform the entire Wild Flame Army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "Divine Peak Nine...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>My focus now has to shift to Divine Peak Nine! That's where I can get my hands on the death scent liquid. With it, I can fully restore the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity is completely restored, I'll gain a true immortal body. I won't have to tread lightly anymore; I can dive headfirst into my plans."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Turning to Guy, he asked, "You're a leader of ten thousand and part of the Wild Flame Army's upper echelon. Do you know the selection criteria for the next elite group being sent to Divine Peak Nine? Is there a chance I could join them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy quickly responded, "My Lord, I do know a bit about how the Wild Flame Army selects its elite for Divine Peak Nine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"About a month ago, they sent a contingent of 100 thousand elite troops to Divine Peak Nine, joining forces with the Inferno Army, Thunderwind Army, and Firestorm Army to launch a massive assault. Unfortunately, they were crushed by the Deathborn army, suffering nearly fifty percent casualties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yet, the higher-ups in the Ninth Dark Deity Legion didn't give up. They're planning a second offensive and have ordered the four armies to replenish their ranks within half a month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Our Wild Flame Army lost over 46 thousand soldiers, and this time, we're supposed to send another 50 thousand, all of whom need to be elite troops.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just yesterday, I received orders to select a thousand elite warriors from my ranks to form a thousand-man unit for the second wave to Divine Peak Nine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up at this news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, whether I can go to Divine Peak Nine depends entirely on you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy nodded. "That's right!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My Lord, are you seriously considering heading to Divine Peak Nine? I must advise against it&mdash;the place is incredibly dangerous! Anyone with connections has been coming to me, pleading not to be assigned to the support team for Divine Peak Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"As per usual, I plan to select from those with strength but no backing. Those sent to Divine Peak Nine often end up as cannon fodder!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, my Lord, it would be wise not to take that risk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow at Guy's concerns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thanks for the warning, but I have to go to Divine Peak Nine. So, please arrange for me to join the support team heading there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though worried, Guy understood the gravity of Osborne's decision and didn't dare defy him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well, if you're set on it, my Lord, I'll make it happen and add your name to the list for the Divine Peak Nine support team. I'll be right by your side to protect you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And I think it's crucial to select the strongest from my ranks to join us as well; that way, we can ensure your safety."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne chuckled and shook his head. "There's no need for that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just stay here and carry on as usual. You don't need to bring the strongest warriors into this doomed mission. Many of them have significant backgrounds; forcing them into a situation like this could raise suspicions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Just focus on getting my name on the list. Everything else should proceed normally. Right now, your top priority is to avoid drawing attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And if you notice any unusual activity from your family, let me know immediately. If they start plotting against the Spark of Blaze or trying to undermine the Human Community, it's critical that you subtly work to disrupt those plans. Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Guy nodded seriously. "Yes, my Lord, I'll remember that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Satisfied, Osborne nodded back. "Now, let's get you to push for my promotion to chiliarch."</span></p><div class="pagination">
