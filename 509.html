  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" said Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne froze. "The god who controls time in the Court of the Sun? What nonsense are you talking about?" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa surprisingly ignored Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression was extremely strange. It was as if she had fallen into some kind of memory. Her face turned pale, which made Osborne suddenly nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, what's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?" Osborne asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa finally responded and shook her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine! I just remembered some things from the past," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned deeply. He still felt that Isa's state was off, so he asked again, "Isa, what exactly do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa looked at Osborne with a hesitant expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really want to know?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded firmly and grabbed Isa's hand. "I want to know! Because something is clearly bothering you, so this must be important to you, right? If it's important to you, then it's important to me!" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled slightly. "Don't be so nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's only just awakened. To be more precise, her powers have just awakened. Given the timing, it's about time she woke up," Isa said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she spoke, she pointed to the sofa. "Let's talk over there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pulled Isa over to sit down and looked at her expectantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was silent for a while before finally speaking, "What do you want to know? Today, </span><span>I'll tell you everything I can," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly asked, "You just mentioned the Court of the Sun. What is that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa calmly replied, "According to ancient records, the Court of the Sun is a group of gods within the solar system."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh? Ancient records? Isn't that just a myth?" Osborne asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled faintly. "Who knows? Anyway, I've read about it. Besides, you're already Class A. Do you still not believe that gods really exist?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do gods exist?" Osborne wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't know. If it had been a few months ago, he would have firmly believed that gods didn't exist. He believed in science, in materialism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he had seen too many powerful metahumans and martial artists. The existence of gods didn't seem so strange anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, gods could just be powerful beings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only that in the eyes of ordinary people, their abilities were too powerful. So, they were called gods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stopped dwelling on it and asked, "So, the god you mentioned in the Court of the Sun who controls the world is actually just a powerful time elemental metahuman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled and nodded. "You can think of it that way," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> when you said she awakened, what does that mean? Did she pass out before?" Osborne asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She didn't pass out. She used up all her power to help this world quickly return to the right path, and then she died," Isa said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was shocked. "If she died, how could she wake up?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa looked at Osborne calmly. "That's why she's a god!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?!" Osborne was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne froze. He was unable to refute her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's gaze became distant as she continued, "It's very complicated. According to ancient records, a long time ago, there were many gods in the world. They fought wars everywhere to gain followers, eventually angering the god who controls the night in the Court of the Sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The god who controls the night turned the entire world into darkness instantly, nearly wiping out all the gods and living beings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There were very few gods who survived!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the god who controls time was one of them! She died, too. Before her death, she used her power to return to a time before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As she looked at the destroyed world, she didn't have the power to return the entire world to a time before the destruction. So, she chose another way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She used up all her power and life to speed up time in the entire solar system by billions of times! She used billions of years to erase the traces of the gods' war and allow this world to give birth to intelligent life and new gods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The accelerated time still hasn't stopped! And now, I feel that the god who controls time has awakened. Once she fully awakens, time in this world will return to normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When that happens, the world will be completely different from what it is now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The gods will reappear."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa stopped speaking at this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mouth was wide open, and he didn't respond for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long while, he finally said, "Isa, where did you read this storybook? It sounds kind of interesting. Can you recommend it to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa rolled her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't believe me?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a wry smile. "Can I believe it? You said time in the solar system has been sped up by billions of times? Why haven't I felt it? Isn't this a joke?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't believe I couldn't fool you. It's no fun! I originally had more to the story. Now that you've figured it out, I won't tell the rest,</span><span>" she</span><span> said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was curious and asked with a smile, "What's the rest of the story? Tell me anyway."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa shook her head. "You definitely wouldn't believe the rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For example, I'm actually the god who controls the night in the Court of the Sun. I'm the one who buried all the gods and destroyed the world," Isa said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa finished speaking. Her face was full of smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doesn't it sound too fake?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but laugh out loud. "It does sound a bit fake and a bit exaggerated. If you're the god who buried the gods and controls the night in the Court of the Sun, then I'm the god who controls beautiful women in the Court of the Sun!" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Osborne grinned mischievously and wrapped his arms around Isa's waist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All the beautiful women in the world are under my control!" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa rolled her eyes. "You're not the god who controls beautiful women in the Court of the Sun. There's no such god there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the story I made up, you're the god in the Court of the Sun who...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Controls death!" Isa said.</span></p><div class="pagination">
