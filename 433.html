  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, spit it out, why are you really here? Don't tell me it's just for a kiss." Isa grumbled after a while, fixing the clothes Osborne had messed up. "If that's all you came for, I'll be seriously disappointed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was in a great mood. Isa's attitude towards him had noticeably changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, her words were still frosty, and her pretty face held that familiar look of annoyance, but her eyes had softened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, she would reject Osborne outright instead of holding back at the last moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was something even Isa herself might not have realized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Remembering his real purpose, Osborne spoke up, "Last night's battle made me realize just how far I am from where I need to be. I want to improve my skills, so I'm hoping you can teach me more advanced martial arts techniques."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded in response. "It's good that you recognize your lack of strength. You've only been training for a short time. Even though the Breath of Celestial has helped you close the gap with your peers, you're still far behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For the time being, stay here and focus on your training with me. I'll teach you more advanced martial arts techniques based on your progress."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Osborne smiled and said, "Thanks, Isa. You're the best! I mean it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa rolled her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment before adding, "But Isa, aren't you worried that once I master these skills, I'll surpass you? If that happens, you'll have no choice but to submit to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa responded with a cold smile, "Worried? I'm looking forward to that day. If you can beat me, go ahead. I'd love to see it. In fact, if you can do it today, I'll wash up and wait for you in bed. You can do whatever you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words left Osborne speechless, his jaw hanging open as he rubbed his nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, take your time! Take your time! You're incredible. Even now, I still have no idea what your true strength is. Even Bryce, a Class AAA warrior with the Trident of Poseidon, looks up to you. You must be stronger than him, right? Isa, are you a Class S Supreme Overlord?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa raised an eyebrow at his question. "Do you think I'm a Class S Supreme Overlord?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Isa shook her head. "Sorry, wrong guess. I'm not a Class S Supreme Overlord. Don't worry so much about it. As long as you keep pushing yourself, you'll have a shot at catching up, maybe even surpassing me. Now, get up. Let's start training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've already got Spiral Force down, which gives your attacks some serious bite. Next up, I'm gonna teach you Ninefold Tide Crash! Once you've mastered that, you'll be leagues ahead of where Spiral Force got you!" Isa's tone grew serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne straightened up, intrigued. "What's Ninefold Tide Crash all about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ninefold Tide Crash allows you to unleash multiple attacks in an instant, with each attack stacking together to create an effect greater than the sum of its parts, dramatically increasing your attack potential," Isa told him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Like any advanced combat technique, there are different levels of mastery, ranging from basic understanding to mastery, to pushing it to its limits, and even beyond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With a basic grasp of Ninefold Tide Crash, your attack potential increases by 30%. Master it, and you'll see a 60% increase. If you push Ninefold Tide Crash to its limits, your attack potential will double!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, limits are meant to be broken. When you push past your limits and master the Ninefold Tide Crash beyond its current level, only then can you say you've truly mastered it. At that point, your attack potential will increase by at least twofold."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Isa explained this, Osborne's breath quickened. "Increase my attack potential? If I master it beyond its current level, my attack potential could double?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's incredible!" Osborne's eyes lit up with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Isa quickly burst his bubble. "It's not that easy to push the Ninefold Tide Crash beyond its limits! In fact, reaching the limit itself is already quite an achievement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take your Spiral Force, for example. You've barely scratched the surface! If you push your Spiral Force to its limit, or even beyond, the power would be just as terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember this. There's no such thing as the strongest martial art technique, only the strongest person! Even if I don't use any martial art skills, I could still crush you like a bug."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scratched his nose awkwardly and said, "Yeah, yeah, I get it. You're amazing. Can't I be proud that my wife is so badass?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa froze for a moment when she heard that, and then her cheeks flushed red. "What nonsense are you talking about? Who's your wife? Go find your Clarissa! And just so you know, the only reason I let you kiss me was because I wanted to see what it felt like. I was just using you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lip and spat, "Don't think I have feelings you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled at her words, "I get it. I'm happy to be your tool. Just let me know when you want to kiss again. I'm always up for it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's face turned even redder. "Are you asking for trouble? Are you going to study or not? If not, get out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, alright! I'm on it." Osborne quickly dropped the teasing and buckled down to study.</span></p><div class="pagination">
