  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emi had once held the 499th spot on the Godson Rankings, and many knew that her true strength could easily place her much higher.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, with the recent ascents of Axell, Maia, and Clarissa, Emi had been pushed out of the rankings altogether.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite her potential, she hadn't made any moves to reclaim her spot.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone understood that Emi had the capability to break back into the Godson Rankings if she chose to.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, as Emi stepped onto the stage to challenge Osborne as the tenth contender, excitement rippled through the crowd.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Finally! A real expert stepping up to challenge Osborne!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is just the tenth match!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Emi's true strength could easily get her on the Godson Rankings. If she beats Osborne, his winning streak will be stuck at nine!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not even a ten-win streak? That would be a disgrace!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd buzzed with expectations, particularly the members of the League of Divine Descent, who hoped Emi would deliver a crushing blow to Osborne, turning his Honor Quest Ceremony into a spectacle of shame.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the faces of the Augustine family members turned pale.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This isn't fair! It's only the tenth match, and they send someone so strong to challenge Osborne? They don't want him to complete his ten-win streak!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's clearly a setup against Osborne!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite their grievances, the rules were the rules, so their discontent wouldn't change anything.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They watched Osborne intently, silently praying he'd come out on top.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the very least, they wanted him to secure that tenth victory and prevent the Honor Quest Ceremony from becoming a laughingstock.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emi fixed a cold glare on Osborne. "Are you targeting the League of Divine Descent on purpose?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne shrugged, his demeanor calm. "Targeting the League of Divine Descent? What if I am? What if I'm not?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emi's expression darkened. "If that's the case, you'll pay the price."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne chuckled lightly. "Is that so? If I remember correctly, Cuthbert took you down in two moves during his Honor Quest Ceremony. With that kind of skill, you think you can make me pay? </p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who do you think you are? You think you're Marlon or something?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emi's expression darkened instantly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a scoff, she retorted, "Cuthbert defeated me in two moves because he's a powerhouse! He's ranked 36 in the Godson Rankings. And what do you think you are? Just because Cuthbert could do it, you think you can too?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled, shrugging nonchalantly, "I can't."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Glad you know your place," Emi said, a smug grin on her face.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Osborne continued, his demeanor unflinching, "To take you down, I won't need two moves. One will be more than enough."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His words left Emi momentarily speechless.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd below fell silent, disbelief washing over them. Did Osborne really just say he could take down Emi in one move? No way! Emi's strength is more than enough to get her back into the Godson Rankings. Among all the young prodigies out there, she has a shot at breaking into the top hundred. Even Cuthbert needed two moves to beat her. What gives Osborne the right to claim he could do it in one?</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many spectators shot Osborne disdainful looks, convinced he was just blowing smoke.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emi shared that sentiment.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"One move to take me down? Ridiculous! Who do you think you are? I'll take you out right now and turn your Honor Quest Ceremony into a disgrace!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Emi launched her attack.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Dark Realm enveloped the arena once more, but this time, her Dark Realm was far stronger than Satoru's; it was a Level Two Realm.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, Osborne remained unfazed, allowing the darkness to wash over him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He took a step forward, moving toward Emi with unwavering confidence.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Kill!" Emi commanded, her voice echoing through the arena.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emi sprang into action, wielding massive dark energy to attack Osborne, her own form shrouded in shadows, making it hard to pinpoint her location.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But unfortunately for her, this tactic proved futile.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne erupted with a faint martial arts aura that effortlessly blocked Emi's onslaught. Raising his hand high, he struck down decisively in one direction.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, Emi's Dark Realm shattered, and she was violently thrust out of the shadows by the force of Osborne's blow.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Blood spewed from her mouth, her teeth scattered like confetti, shock and disbelief etched across her face.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her body crashed heavily onto the arena floor. She struggled to rise, but stars danced in her vision, pain throbbing in her skull, making it impossible to get up.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had lost!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With just one move&mdash;no, one slap&mdash;Osborne had decisively defeated Emi, obliterating her Level Two Dark Realm in the process.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd erupted in gasps, eyes wide with disbelief as they turned to Osborne, marveling at his power.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, the Augustine family cheered triumphantly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With this victory, Osborne had achieved his ten consecutive wins!</p><div class="pagination">
