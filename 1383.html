  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on here?" Osborne's voice cut through the tension as he approached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The expressions on Harry and Amelia's faces were grim, their anxiety palpable as they stood before a towering man who exuded arrogance and coldness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That guy's back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone shouted, their voice echoing through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes turned to Osborne, including the piercing gaze of the tall man, who smirked with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned but continued forward, determined to uncover the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Swift, it's him! He's the mysterious stranger that Harry and Amelia took in!" a shifty-eyed man chimed in, ingratiating himself with the imposing figure. His face was a mask of sycophancy. "As soon as I spotted him, I reported it to you right away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia shot daggers at the </span><span>man,</span><span> their anger evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't seem to care. "Mr. Swift, this is a critical mining area for the Ninth Dark Deity Legion. How could Harry and his sister harbor a stranger like this? They must be punished!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And as for this unknown man, he's probably here to steal Essence Crystals! Every single crystal belongs to the Ninth Dark Deity Legion, and he dares to try and take them? I say we should just get rid of him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's words ignited fury in Harry and Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia shouted, her voice ringing out, "Vance Rodriguez, shut your mouth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Swift, it's not like that! Osborne is actually a distant relative of ours. He's here to help the Ninth Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right now, you're hunting down the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> army at the Ninth divine peak, and you need all the Essence Crystals you can get. Osborne wants to work as a miner, digging for the Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We just haven't had a chance to report it to you yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, Osborne is part of our family. We'll make sure to deliver three times the Essence Crystals each month, no exceptions! If we fail, then punish us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Amelia spoke, Patrick Swift, the Dark Deity overseer, wore a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You say he's your relative? Is that really the case? Hmph, do you think I'm easily fooled? And the fact that you didn't report this in advance is a clear violation. Violations come with consequences!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia's expression turned pale at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Patrick quickly added, "However, I'm not heartless. We do need miners to supply the Ninth Dark Deity Legion with more Essence Crystals, so I won't kill him. I'll give him a chance to work as a miner."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Relief washed over Harry and Amelia's faces, but Vance was quick to interject.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Swift, we can't let them off the hook! He's..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Vance could finish, Patrick slapped him hard across the face, leaving him stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My decisions aren't up for debate, you worthless rat! If you want to be my lapdog, then be a good one and keep your mouth shut!" Patrick shot back, his voice dripping with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning his attention back to Harry and Amelia, he continued with a chilling smile, "I can spare his life and let him work here, but you two broke the rules. That means you'll have to face punishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll pay three times the amount of Essence Crystals each month! If you can't meet that quota, well, you know the consequences. I'll make you regret ever being born."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and Amelia gasped, their faces turning ghostly white.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Three times?! Mr. Swift, that's impossible! Even if we lived in the mines, we couldn't gather that much Essence Crystal! Please, Mr. Swift..." Amelia pleaded desperately, her voice cracking with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" Patrick bellowed, his body erupting with a fearsome surge of power&mdash;a signature trait of a Superior Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harry and his sister, Amelia, were but an Intermediate Deity and a Junior Deity, respectively. How could they possibly withstand such a formidable force?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces paled in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick sneered. "You can refuse to triple your Essence Crystals if you like. But then, I'll kill him right here, and then I'll make you pay... dearly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused, letting his threat linger in the air before adding coldly, "You choose."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were scornful, piercing through Harry and Amelia with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The siblings' faces contorted in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, they gritted their teeth and conceded. "Fine! We'll triple the Essence Crystals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick scoffed. "Excellent choice!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only seven more days until the Essence Crystal dues are due. I'll be back, and if your contribution isn't up to snuff, don't expect any mercy from me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Patrick strutted away, flanked by his entourage, who swaggered with an air of arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alone now, the villagers of Rodriguez Village simply stared at Harry and Amelia with pity in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tripling their monthly Essence Crystal contribution?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was nothing but an arbitrary pretext concocted by Patrick to torment them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their lives were about to become considerably more arduous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The villagers said nothing, turning their backs coldly and dispersing.</span></p><div class="pagination">
