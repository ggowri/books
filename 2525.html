  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If possible, Osborne would even want to leave the Phantomagic Realm now and head to the Frenetic Storm Warband's resource-bearing planet to search for his parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But unfortunately, he couldn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Phantomagic Realm only allows entry, not exit. Once you enter, you either die inside or wait for a month until the Phantomagic Realm disappears to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Today marks the eighteenth day since Osborne entered the Phantomagic Realm, with twelve days remaining until it disappears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, even though Osborne is very anxious, he can only wait for these twelve days to pass. He can now choose to snatch others' Dragon Elixir like those major forces and collect as much Dragon Elixir as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in the end, Osborne chose not to do so because he didn't care about those Dragon Elixirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had already obtained over twenty jadeflare vials filled with Dragon Elixir from Hamilton and Trenton. However, most of them were Low-grade Dragon Elixir and Mid-grade Dragon Elixir, with only a small portion being Top-grade Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since he had previously used Elven Sacred Water, Top-grade Dragon Elixir had almost no effect on Osborne. Only Legendary Dragon Elixir could bring him gains in the Enlightenment State.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, among all the Dragon Elixirs from Hamilton and Trenton, there was only one drop of Legendary Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That's right, out of over twenty jadeflare vials, there was only one drop of Legendary Dragon Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Trenton, Dominic, and Ronald, three warriors at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, didn't manage to obtain even a single drop of Legendary Dragon Elixir in the Phantomagic Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Osborne very disappointed. Therefore, Osborne felt that even if he went to snatch others' Dragon Elixir, the final gain wouldn't be significant and could almost be negligible compared to the Dragon Elixir he already had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Perhaps only warriors at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection can obtain a large amount of Legendary Dragon Elixir in the Phantomagic Realm. However, only about twenty warriors at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection entered the Phantomagic Realm in total."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"None of them are someone I can handle right now. If I appear in front of them, the result will definitely be them robbing me, not me robbing them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne gave up the idea of robbing and decided to find a secluded place to spend the twelve days in cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, in a corner of the Phantomagic Realm, Romina and Dalia from Blossom Cage, along with several other warriors at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, gathered together, whispering to each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obviously, Dalia held the highest status among them. She glanced at everyone and then asked, "Have you all completed the task?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone immediately responded, "Ms. Gibbs, rest assured, we have all completed the task."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We have followed the leader's orders and placed the Bewitching Lantern in the proper location, allowing it to absorb the Hallucinogenic Power of the Phantomagic Realm and the Demon Dragon's Breath. We&rsquo;ve also concealed its aura to ensure no one can discover it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another person eagerly said, "I&rsquo;ve completed the task as well. I&rsquo;ve placed all the Bewitching Lanterns in position. They&rsquo;ve already started absorbing the Hallucinogenic Power and Demon Dragon's Breath. Once the time comes, they can be activated immediately, unleashing the Supreme Bewitching Formation to envelop everyone in the Phantomagic Realm."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The others chimed in, "Me too, the task is done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I&rsquo;ve completed the task too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dalia nodded. "Very well. Next, we just wait for orders. But before that, each of you must guard your assigned area."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"When the leader's plan begins, if any mistakes occur because of you, none of you will survive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Dalia glanced at Romina and continued, "Ms. Hubbard, you especially need to be careful. Because of your mistake, we&rsquo;ve already lost one Bewitching Lantern, making the Bewitching Formation less perfect. However, it&rsquo;s not a big problem."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But if the Bewitching Lantern encounters another problem, the leader will definitely not spare us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing her words, Romina's eyes filled with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The expressions of the others also turned extremely grave and serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Gibbs, rest assured. We will continue to protect the Bewitching Lantern in the coming days and ensure no issues arise," they all assured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dalia said, "Very well. You may go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, the others turned around and left in different directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Watching their backs, Dalia let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, dozens of terrifying tentacles emerged from her body, and her aura instantly became overwhelmingly frightening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Originally, she was only at Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection. But in that instant, her cultivation level broke through Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection and reached Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, she slowly spoke in an unbearably harsh voice, "I have prepared for thousands of years. Now, I am finally starting my plan. This time, I will break through Proto-imperial Empyrean Sacredness and reach Imperial Empyrean Sacredness. By then, I can return to the deeper parts of the universe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, she burst into maniacal laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The dozens of terrifying tentacles on Romina's body thrashed wildly, incredibly frightening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was scanning the surroundings with Satan's Eye, searching for a safe and secluded place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What is that?" Suddenly, Osborne looked in one direction, showing a surprised expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He saw through Satan's Eye a lantern emitting a pink glow in the distance. Around it was a peculiar shield that concealed its aura and pink light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without Satan's Eye, Osborne would never have noticed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Bewitching Lantern? This is the second Bewitching Lantern!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's expression changed. This Bewitching Lantern was clearly placed here by someone from Blossom Cage. It was hidden so well. Obviously, Blossom Cage didn't want anyone to see it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne hadn't wanted to find a secluded place to train and spend the last twelve days, he wouldn't have come here or discovered this Bewitching Lantern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne didn't act rashly and thought, "The leader of Blossom Cage, that demonic cultivator, targets everyone in the Phantomagic Realm. He wants to devour everyone's vital essence, soul power, and potential to enhance his own cultivation level."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I thought he would wait until the Phantomagic Realm ended to make his move. But I didn't expect these Bewitching Lanterns to be placed in the Phantomagic Realm. Could that demonic cultivator be planning to act within the Phantomagic Realm?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne's expression turned grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If that's the case, all the preparations he made earlier might go wrong, and even he himself could be in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne thought, "No. I absolutely can't let that demonic cultivator's plan succeed. If I didn't know, I wouldn't interfere. But now that I do, I must ruin his plan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That demonic cultivator is currently only at Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection. His greatest reliance is the Bewitching Formation formed by ninety-nine Bewitching Lanterns. As long as I take all his Bewitching Lanterns away, his Bewitching Formation can't be activated. Then, his plan is bound to fail."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne became excited. He thought, "Each Bewitching Lantern is a Legendary Sacred Artifact. There are ninety-nine Bewitching Lanterns here. If I can find them all, I'll have ninety-nine Legendary Sacred Artifacts. Then, I'll strike it rich."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne stopped hesitating and reached out to grab the Bewitching Lantern in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that moment, the situation changed.</span></p><div class="pagination">
