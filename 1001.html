  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's taunts ignited the rage in both Sin and Crimson. The thought of their daughter, whose life snuffed out by Osborne, added fuel to their fury. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a dangerous aura of trying to kill, they were poised to strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, beneath his facade of bravado, Osborne was tensed, ready for an onslaught.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His provocative words are his strategy to incite anger in both adversaries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they lost control of anger, they would be easy to make mistakes that he desperately needed to exploit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As top warriors in class S, their power was much greater that Osborne didn&rsquo;t think he stand a chance to win if they didn&rsquo;t make mistakes.</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it was risky, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their rage could also increase their strength, making them more formidable than ever, just like now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With fury running through their veins, Sin and Crimson lunged at Osborne, their divine artifacts glinting ominously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll make you wish you were never born!" Sin growled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His speed so fast that he was right before Osborne as he talked, his dagger aimed straight at Osborne's right shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seems like Sin intended to relish in Osborne's suffering, not killing him at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was exactly what Osborne had hoped for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he underestimated Sin's speed, the relentless energy on the dagger was about to strike his shoulder before he could react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's only option was to unleash his martial art aura to defend himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Martial art aura!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dagger met his aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the transformation of Osborne's martial art aura, his defense became unbreakably strong. Even the Class S assassins from the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, using all their might, couldn't break his defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But under Sin's attacks&mdash;one of the top-tier Class S warriors&mdash;Osborne's martial art </span><span>aura couldn't make another miracle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin's divine artifact dagger, after expending eighty percent of its strength, finally pierced through Osborne's martial art aura and plunged deeply into his right shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood gushed out, splattering onto Sin's face&mdash;a sight he met without flinching, even reveling in it as he licked the crimson droplets with a sadistic grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crimson joined the fray, her dagger finding its target in Osborne's left shoulder, blood erupting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crimson roared, her voice a whip-crack of fury, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You killed my daughter! I'll break your limbs and torture you so much that you regret every second you live and beg for forgiveness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next second, both Sin and Crimson drew their daggers back and aimed for Osborne's thighs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greyson and Roy yelled, finally snapping to reality, </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop! "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get away from him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They charged forward, desperate to pull Osborne away from two torturers by attacking at them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back off!" Sin bellowed, using a fistful of power to send a punch barreling through the air toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a deafening explosion as they were flung backward, blood spewing from their mouths as they tumbled to the ground, pale and shaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greyson and Roy struggled to keep their feet, with disbelief in eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap in power was huge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "A casual punch from Sin sent us flying! Is this the prowess of a top-tier Class S? It is terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with our combined efforts, it is evident we stand no chance against Sin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And there is </span><span>Crimson</span><span> right beside him, her strength nearly matching his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How can we even hope to fight back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, their desperate intervention had managed to draw Sin's attention away from Osborne, leaving only the furious </span><span>Crimson</span><span> set to deliver more punishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a fierce force, Crimson thrust her divine artifact dagger toward Osborne's left leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in that split second, Osborne snapped into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wrapped martial art aura tightly around his right leg and drew upon the power of the Divine Bone within it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You old hag, you think you can shatter my limbs? Not without some consequences on your end! Get back!" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne spat with a cold look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne channeled every ounce of his power into a single kick. The force was terrifying, and it burst forth with a faster speed than Crimson's </span><span>dagger&rsquo;s</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caught off guard by the unexpected retaliation, Crimson had no time to dodge. Instead, she pressed on with her attack, thrusting her dagger toward Osborne's leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The collision was explosive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's kick landed against Crimson's shoulder, sending her reeling backward. But </span><span>at the same time her dagger found its mark, puncturing through his defenses to sink deep into his left leg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fresh blood burst from Osborne, but he remained unfazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crimson was also bleeding, full of shock as she processed the sheer force in Osborne's kick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wouldn&rsquo;t expect that Osborne's right leg bone had already transformed into a Divine Bone. Even a thread of divine power was beyond her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sickening thud echoed as Crimson crashed to the ground. Her right shoulder was drooping limply. Osborne's kick had crushed the bone, leaving her in agony. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It ignited a wild fury in her, her anger morphing into a relentless thirst for revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to kill you!" Crimson shouted and lunged at Osborne once more.</span></p><div class="pagination">
