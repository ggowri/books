  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go! It's time for the Ascension One Supernal Deity King match. Our turn to step onto the stage!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne called out to Anastasia, Zoe, and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did everyone shift their attention away from the pitiful state of Julian and refocus on the upcoming match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fifth match, was it really going to be Osborne and his group taking the field?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who else would be joining them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes turned to the God of Light. The Human Community had already won four consecutive matches, and their morale was at its peak. If they could secure another victory, even just one more, the tide of the battle would completely turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the very least, today, they wouldn't have to retreat. Instead, it would be the Dark Deity Legion forced to pull back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This fifth match was crucial.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the Blood Demon members had completely crushed and slaughtered the Paramount Supreme Clan's geniuses in the previous match, when it came to the Ascension One Supernal Deity King level, no one felt confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, who else will be joining you in this match?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the God of Light couldn't help but ask, her curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't stop walking as he replied with a smile, "No one else. Just the eight of us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the eight of them flew out of the Sanctum of Light, heading straight for the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the people inside the Sanctum of Light were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This match, only the eight of them are representing the Human Community? No one else?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is madness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if they're planning to strategically forfeit or surrender, they should at least fill out the numbers! Otherwise, the Paramount Supreme Clan will think we can't even muster a hundred Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ridiculous! Absolutely ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community has just won four matches in a row. If we win one more, we'll have the upper hand today. How can we just give up now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if the Human Community doesn't have much confidence in the Ascension One match, they should at least try!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they really can't win, then they can surrender."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, just like they did the past two days!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's expressions were grim. They all believed that Osborne and his group were planning to surrender immediately, effectively giving up on the match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, Jethro's voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who said they're planning to surrender? If they've decided to fight with just eight people, there must be a reason! Maybe they think eight is enough. Maybe they believe having more people would just hold them back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd fell silent for a moment after Jethro's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, an even louder uproar erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madness! How can they be so arrogant? The enemy has a hundred Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings! They only have eight! How can they possibly win?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if they're geniuses, can they really take on ten opponents each?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are these people?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where did such arrogant fools come from?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd grew even angrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, a cold, proud voice echoed from the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings are here to challenge the so-called geniuses of the Paramount Supreme Clan once again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Trash of the Paramount Supreme Clan, if you have the guts, step onto the stage!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Complete and utter silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's ears rang with Osborne's words, their faces filled with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, they're the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings! Osborne... he's their leader, Theodore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So that's it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No wonder they're so arrogant, looking down on the Paramount Supreme Clan's geniuses. It's them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They've already broken through to Ascension One Supernal Deity King?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of talent is this?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But those on the Paramount Supreme Clan's side were even more shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings had reappeared! Not only that, they had broken through from mid Deity King Level to Ascension One Supernal Deity King in such a short time, now standing on the border competition's arena!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alongside the Seven Young Deity Kings was Hannah from the Mystic Feather Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the eight of them stood in the arena at this moment, staring down at them with arrogant expressions and provocative gazes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What were they planning to do?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the sky, the massive divine power projection of Icy One appeared once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Osborne and the others in the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings?! I never expected your cultivation to advance so quickly! Just a few months ago, you were only at mid Deity King Level, weren't you? It seems the Human Community has invested heavily in your training!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's gaze shifted to the God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Light's divine power projection also appeared, hovering near Osborne and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was worried that Icy One might suddenly attack Osborne and his group, so she was there to protect them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Icy One's words, the God of Light wanted to tell him that the Human Community hadn't invested any resources in Osborne and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their growth was entirely their own doing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, she didn't say anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't even speak, because this was Osborne's battle. As long as Icy One didn't forcibly intervene, she wouldn't interfere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Icy One and said, "Can we skip the small talk? Hurry up and send your Paramount Supreme Clan geniuses up here. We can't wait to kill a few more!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A hundred Ascension One Paramount Supreme Clan geniuses. Send them up to die! Once we've finished them off, there are still three more matches to go. Let's not waste any time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finish the matches quickly so you can start your retreat. After all, today you'll be retreating 5 million miles. With so many people in the Dark Deity Legion, I'm afraid you won't have enough time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One couldn't help but laugh at Osborne's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Retreat 5 million miles? Are you saying we won't win a single match today? That the Human Community will win all eight matches?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's face was full of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where do you get such confidence? What nonsense is this 'Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings'? You're nothing! Even the Human Community's Seven Great Deity Kings wouldn't dare to be so arrogant!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne replied, "My confidence comes from the Paramount Supreme Clan! It's because the Paramount Supreme Clan is so useless that I feel almost invincible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for whether the Human Community will win all eight matches today... From the moment I stepped into this arena, there was no longer any doubt. You will lose today. You won't win a single match!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One burst into laughter, but soon his expression turned icy, filled with killing intent. "Arrogant brat, you're digging your own grave! Since that's the case, I'll grant your wish!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure it's just the eight of you? Don't complain later that the Paramount Supreme Clan outnumbered you when you lose!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled. "Don't worry. It's just the eight of us. Eight is more than enough to deal with a hundred Paramount Supreme Clan trash at our level. Hurry up and send them up to die..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine. In that case, prepare to meet your end!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Icy One's divine power projection vanished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, a hundred Ascension One Supernal Deity Kings from the Paramount Supreme Clan stepped onto the arena, their faces cold and filled with killing intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared at Osborne and the others, their minds replaying Icy One's earlier instructions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Spare no effort to kill the Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're so arrogant, thinking eight of them can take on a hundred. This is your chance! If a hundred of you can't kill eight of them...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then don't bother coming back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die in the arena!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
