  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina was furious at this moment, thinking, "What gives Osborne the right to fight me on equal footing?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I'm using a Supreme Sacred Artifact, while Osborne is only using a Superior Sacred Artifact. I'm employing the strongest archery technique from the Royal Family of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, yet I've never even seen Osborne's archery before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under such circumstances, what gives Osborne the right to fight me on equal footing? This is simply a humiliation for me. I absolutely cannot accept it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina angrily said, "This must be your limit. That last arrow was different from the previous four. This must be your strongest arrow, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"However, I still have an even stronger sixth and seventh arrow. So, you will still lose. Now, feel the power of the sixth arrow of the Twinkling Star Arrow."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The massive Blackstar Bow trembled violently. Seraphina drew the bowstring again, but it didn&rsquo;t seem as effortless this time. This indicated that with Seraphina's strength, unleashing the sixth arrow of the Twinkling Star Arrow wasn&rsquo;t so easy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She became serious and focused, unleashing her full power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, she drew the bowstring of the Blackstar Bow. A darker arrow appeared on it, as if it could swallow even light.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina shouted, "Twinkling Star Arrow Sixth Arrow! Twinkle!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She immediately released the bowstring. The terrifying dark arrow swiftly shot toward Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne had already drawn the bowstring of the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three Sacred Power Arrows were already prepared. At this moment, they were also released.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He shouted, "Solar Sacred Arrow, Earth Arrow, Three-Arrow Volley!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Three Sacred Power Arrows instantly charged toward Seraphina's Twinkling Star Arrow Sixth Arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The power of the Earth Arrow was immense. At this moment, the three arrows exploded together, instantly engulfing Seraphina's Twinkling Star Arrow Sixth Arrow. That terrifying Sixth Arrow of the Twinkling Star Arrow was overwhelmed in the void before it could unleash its might, and the devastating explosive force surged toward Seraphina.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Seraphina was stunned. However, she reacted quickly and immediately activated the power of the Blackstar Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Blackstar Bow trembled violently, blocking all the explosive force.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, everyone saw the Blackstar Bow being pushed back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The intense explosion spilled out from both sides of the Blackstar Bow. It didn't harm Seraphina but struck the arena's protective shield, causing it to shake violently as if it were about to collapse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This situation left the spectators stunned once again.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man said in shock, "What's going on? Didn't Princess Seraphina have a slight advantage when she shot the fourth arrow? Why did the situation suddenly reverse? Osborne's Sacred Power Arrow clearly seemed weaker. So why did he overpower Princess Seraphina?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A woman widened her eyes. "Princess Seraphina has already unleashed the sixth arrow of the Twinkling Star Arrow. But not only did she fail to defeat Osborne, she was even overpowered by him."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If not for the Supreme Sacred Artifact Blackstar Bow having some defensive properties, Princess Seraphina might have already been injured."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another man sighed, "Is this Osborne's strength? Who was it earlier that said Osborne would surely lose and Princess Seraphina would definitely win? Who said Osborne wasn't worthy of facing Princess Seraphina?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another woman echoed, "Who said the championship would definitely belong to Princess Seraphina? Step forward!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The spectators were all utterly shocked, especially the ordinary contestants. At this moment, they all widened their eyes because they saw the powerful and terrifying Seraphina actually being overpowered by Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They realized that they had actually doubted Osborne's strength before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mason and Brenda suddenly remembered how they had provoked Osborne at the Empire Hotel earlier and even said they would teach him a lesson in the ring.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, they felt utterly terrified.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that time, Osborne said they couldn't withstand a single move from him, but they thought he was crazy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, they believed Osborne's words.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With the strength Osborne displayed now, they had no chance of withstanding even one move from him, and Osborne could kill them with a single strike.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This realization made Brenda and Mason feel extremely frightened yet somewhat relieved because they hadn't faced Osborne in the ring.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Otherwise, their fate would have been tragic.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina angrily shouted, "I don't believe it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Staring at Osborne, her eyes turned red. Her intense anger and killing intent enveloped Osborne at that moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She angrily said, "I never thought you could force me to unleash the final arrow of the Twinkling Star Arrow, also its strongest one."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't believe you can withstand this arrow. This arrow will decide the winner, and the victor will definitely be me. Twinkling Star Arrow, Seventh Arrow! Starburst! Twinkle!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Seraphina unleashed her strongest attack. The entire arena shook violently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Terrifying power began converging onto the Blackstar Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the power of the Supreme Sacred Artifact was fully unleashed by Seraphina. Although she had not yet reached Empyrean Sacredness and could only harness part of its power, it was already terrifying enough.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A brilliant arrow appeared on the Blackstar Bow's string, then aimed in Osborne's direction. At the tip of the arrow, the void kept tearing apart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seraphina shouted angrily, "Osborne, face my strongest arrow. You can't withstand this. No one can withstand it before reaching Empyrean Sacredness. Surrender!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Seraphina's face was extremely pale. Her body was also trembling slightly. Clearly, unleashing the seventh arrow of the Twinkling Star Arrow was incredibly taxing for her current state. If someone interfered now, she might fail and even suffer a backlash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne realized this, but he didn't act on it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't want Seraphina to be defeated by the backlash of the Supreme Sacred Artifact. If that happened, Seraphina would feel unconvinced and refuse to admit that Osborne was stronger than her because she hadn't unleashed her strongest arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Osborne didn't interfere with Seraphina unleashing her strongest arrow but slowly drew the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even at this moment, his expression remained unchanged, still calm and indifferent, as if Seraphina's impending strongest arrow was no different from the previous ones.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The arena shook even more violently. The spectators were now extremely serious, knowing that the outcome would soon be decided.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Who will claim the championship will likely be decided after this arrow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone sighed, "Osborne is really foolish. He missed a great opportunity. Princess Seraphina is clearly struggling to execute this move. If he interfered now, she definitely wouldn't be able to pull it off and might even suffer backlash from the Supreme Sacred Artifact."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If he did that, Osborne would have won. But Osborne clearly didn't notice this opportunity. He missed the chance to win the championship directly. Now, he's going to pay the price because Princess Seraphina's arrow is too powerful."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kill him!" With Princess Seraphina's furious shout, her strongest Twinkling Star Arrow, the seventh arrow, was finally completed. It shot out swiftly and reached Osborne in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Osborne also launched his attack at this moment. "Solar Sacred Arrow, Earth Arrow, Ten-Arrow Volley!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ten compressed Sacred Power Arrows shot out from the Bloodwrought Bow, instantly colliding with Seraphina's seventh arrow, causing a violent explosion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, as if unable to withstand the terrifying power, the defensive shield at the edge of the arena shattered instantly, and the dreadful force engulfed the entire arena.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone was curious. "Who won?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
