  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After harvesting the Miracle Elixir</span><span>s</span><span>, Osborne stored the humanoid stone back into his Dimensional Space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Diana seemed to relax significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And even Osborne felt a weight lift off his shoulders. He hadn't realized how much pressure that stone had been exerting on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "This humanoid stone definitely has some serious issues.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It might be connected to that shadow at the end of the stairs that Diana mentioned. Just thinking about him caused her Divine Body to collapse and her soul to fragment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression turned serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But why has Diana encountered such a terrifying being? Could it be that she is... reincarnated? Is what she saw a memory from her past life?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced at Diana with his mind racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Time, Ophelia, had returned through reincarnation, regaining memories from her previous life when she broke through to Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, it wasn't entirely out of the realm of possibility that Diana had once been a legendary warrior and was now back in a new form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana caught Osborne's gaze and suddenly felt a flush creep across her cheeks. "Osborne, why are you staring at me? You should use the Miracle Elixir. Without the roots, it's already lost a good chunk of its potency, and if you don't use it soon, it'll just keep fading away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a shame! If only we had two whole Miracle Elixirs, your strength would skyrocket after using them! You're already powerful enough to easily defeat someone at the peak of the Deity Overlord. With two intact Miracle Elixirs, you could get dangerously close to Deity King or even reach that level!" Diana said with a hint of regret in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snapped out of his thoughts and replied casually, "There's nothing to regret. I got this Miracle Elixir for free, and keeping half its potency is already a win in my book."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana nodded, and her focus shifted back to the task at hand. "Then hurry up and take it! I'll keep watch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held the red and blue Miracle Elixirs in his hands. The red one would elevate his realm, while the blue one was meant to enhance his elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "I'm currently at the mid-level of the Celestial Deity realm. I wonder how far I can go with this half of the red Miracle Elixir. Hopefully, it'll push me to Deity Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the blue one... which elemental essence should I boost?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My space elemental essence is already at Level Seven early stage. I doubt half a blue Miracle Elixir will raise it much, maybe just to mid-Level Seven at best. But even a slight improvement would raise my upper limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, it might be better to boost my dark elemental essence. It's already at Level Six peak, and with this half blue Miracle Elixir, I could break through to Level Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While that won't increase my upper limit, it could give me three new dark power techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I could also enhance my lightning elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It might not be as strong as dark elemental essence, but it's pretty close. Plus, Thunder Power is incredibly effective against Deathborns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I can push my lightning elemental essence to Level Seven, dealing with the Deathborn will be much easier."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly found himself in a dilemma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know which elemental essence to enhance with the blue Miracle Elixir&mdash;this was a tough choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If only I had three blue Miracle Elixirs. Then I wouldn't have to stress over this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a bit helpless, he finally decided to use the blue Miracle Elixir to boost his dark elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, let's do this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After making up his mind, Osborne swallowed the red Miracle Elixir whole. As soon as it hit his stomach, it transformed into a torrent of divine power that surged through his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost instantly, he felt his divine power essence expanding and elevating at a breathtaking pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>True to its name, the Miracle Elixir was working wonders. Osborne could see his Celestial Deity realm advancing before his very eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had reached the late stage of Celestial Deity, breaking through to peak Celestial Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he knew that breaking through to the next realm required an immense amount of energy. Even with the Miracle Elixir's help, after advancing two small stages, Osborne felt its potency dwindling significantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining effects would have to carry him through to the Deity Overlord realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thunderous roar, the divine power surrounding Osborne intensified, building to an overwhelming crescendo. At that critical moment, his power exploded outward, becoming terrifyingly potent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deity Overlord!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had done it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't contain his exhilaration. Just before the red Miracle Elixir was completely spent, he had finally broken through to the Deity Overlord realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This has saved me at least two months of training! Without this Miracle Elixir, even with my Infinite Devouring Eyes, it would have taken me a solid two months to reach this level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that I'm a Deity Overlord, my strength has surged! My Level Nine Divine Body can unleash even greater power! I feel invincible...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this isn't the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I still have the blue Miracle Elixir. I hope it helps my dark elemental essence break through to Level Seven and grants me new dark power techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time to get started!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With determination, Osborne swallowed the blue Miracle Elixir, ready to push his limits even further.</span></p><div class="pagination">
