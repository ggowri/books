  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, not only Valentino heard the angry roar of the Magma Devourer, but Brenda, Dustin, and others also heard it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking in the direction of the roar, Brenda felt the anger and killing intent within it, her expression involuntarily turning serious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She thought, "This sound is strange. It's not the roar of an ordinary Beast Clan because it's too harsh and sharp. The roars of the Beast Clan I'm familiar with aren't like this. This sounds more like the roar of a Silicon-based Lifeform."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Brenda became excited and thought, "Is there a Silicon-based Lifeform here?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda comes from </span><span>Skyearth</span><span> Dominion, a First-rate Power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Skyearth</span><span> Dominion is the top First-rate Power in the Glorious Divine Kingdom, stronger than Valentino's Rose Rebels, and has the potential to become the fourth top force on the Racial Convergence Planet alongside Fairy Moon Sect, Golden Dragon Society, and Purple Thunder Gang.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, Brenda's insight is greater than Valentino's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although she had never seen a Silicon-based Lifeform, she had learned about them. She knew they were rare, powerful, and almost entirely treasures.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda hesitated a bit, thinking, "What kind of Silicon-based Lifeform is it? Should I go take a look?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, Brenda couldn't resist her curiosity about the Silicon-based Lifeform and slowly approached it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, her movements were extremely cautious, ready to flee immediately if anything went wrong. As for Dustin, Mckinley, and the others, their situation was pretty much the same.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those who dared to come to the volcanic region on the eastern side of Abyssal Planet were all contenders for the championship. They were all very confident in themselves.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They knew there was danger, but they still couldn't resist wanting to take a look.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, the referees were secretly following them, which is why they were so bold.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, over twenty figures rushed toward the Magma Devourer. Behind them, more than twenty referees followed closely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among them was Referee No. 11, Harriet Sabino, who had previously tracked Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Feeling the roar of the Magma Devourer, Harriet couldn't help but frown tightly and quickly communicated with the other referees.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Something feels off. This roar seems to be coming from a Silicon-based Lifeform."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A referee agreed, "That's right. This roar must be from a Silicon-based Lifeform."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But which type of Silicon-based Lifeform is it? Why is it so angry? Who provoked it? And how come there are Silicon-based Lifeforms on Abyssal Planet? Why didn't the previous exploration teams discover them?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Harriet said, "The previous exploration teams only conducted a simple survey. Silicon-based Lifeforms can hide deep underground, almost blending with the environment. If they don't reveal themselves, it's very hard for the teams to detect them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, Valentino, Brenda, and the others have gone over. They've never seen a Silicon-based Lifeform before, so it's normal for them to be curious about it."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What we need to do now is quickly determine what this Silicon-based Lifeform is and how strong it is. We can't let it harm the contestants."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another referee confidently said, "Don't worry. There are over twenty of us here, and we're all at advanced Empyrean Sacredness. There's no need to fear a Silicon-based Lifeform. We just need to follow them."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The referees talked for a while and decided to wait and see.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the fastest Valentino had already reached a spot not far from the Magma Devourer. He activated Starry Eye and looked at the Magma Devourer, but all he could see was an incredibly intense mass of energy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What is this? The volcanic ash here is too thick. I need to get closer to see it." Valentino felt no fear at all and even wanted to move closer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What he didn't know was that Osborne had already seen him using Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's Valentino." Noticing that Valentino not only didn't run away but was charging toward the Magma Devourer, Osborne's expression turned a bit strange.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"He's courting death. Could the first victim really be him?" Osborne sneered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it were someone else, Osborne might try to communicate and urge them to leave quickly. But since it was Valentino, Osborne chose not to intervene.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Valentino is the most likely contender to win the zone duel. I can let him encounter the Magma Devourer. This way, I can see just how powerful the Magma Devourer really is."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, Osborne continued following behind the Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the Magma Devourer's fiery red, massive eyes suddenly turned toward Valentino. Then, its eyes burst into flames.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was rage!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Magma Devourer instantly picked up speed. Its mountain-like massive body was now crazily closing in on Valentino. Its four limbs, like giant stone pillars, stomped on the void, shaking the heavens and earth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the distance, Valentino's expression instantly changed as he sensed an unusual aura.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "Its energy fluctuations are so powerful. Its strength is immense. I probably can't confront it now. I need to retreat first."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Valentino was confident, he wasn&rsquo;t a fool. After sensing the Magma Devourer's powerful aura up close, he immediately realized it wasn&rsquo;t something he could handle, so he decided to run away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, what he didn&rsquo;t know was that he had already been locked onto by the Magma Devourer. At this moment, it was too late for him to escape.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had already pushed his speed to the limit, but still felt the Magma Devourer getting closer and closer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, a terrifying killing intent engulfed him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, no! I've been locked on. What the hell is this thing? I have the Starry Eye. But I got locked on before I could even see what it is." Thinking this, Valentino ran even more frantically, his face extremely grim.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unfortunately, no matter how fast he was, he was still too slow compared to the Magma Devourer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, the Magma Devourer's massive body burst out from the thick volcanic ash. Its fiery red, turtle-like body, ferocious appearance, and blazing angry eyes instantly made Valentino feel an overwhelming pressure like a mountain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What the hell is this thing? How is it so massive?" Thinking this, Valentino's expression was utterly terrified.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was completely different from what he had imagined. The moment the Magma Devourer appeared, all the surrounding volcanoes erupted wildly, as if the apocalypse had arrived.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, looking at the Magma Devourer, Valentino felt incredibly small.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew he couldn't escape, so he clenched his teeth and gripped the Sacred Artifact tightly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in the next second, the Magma Devourer let out a furious roar. This roar instantly shattered the Sacred Power defense around Valentino. A terrifying force surged into his body, sending him flying backward as he spewed blood uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Magma Devourer didn't directly touch Valentino. Just its roar was enough to overwhelm him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This scene left Osborne, who was secretly watching from afar, stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The referee following Valentino was extremely panicked and exclaimed in shock, "It's actually a Magma Devourer. No! It's at least an advanced Empyrean Sacredness-level Magma Devourer. Valentino has been seriously injured by this enraged Magma Devourer."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, he rushed forward, trying to save Valentino.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at that moment, the Magma Devourer's furious gaze locked onto him. Then, it raised its massive forelimb and stomped forcefully.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud boom, the advanced Empyrean Sacredness-level referee was sent flying, coughing up blood repeatedly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
