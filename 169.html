  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's to say he's not just bluffing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn rolled his eyes and said, "If Sir Radcliffe couldn't secure the deal, how could Apollo? Hmph, I don't believe it. If he fails, I can't wait to see how he handles it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle at the remark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what's so funny?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna had been watching Osborne closely, trying to gauge his reaction to Clarissa's fianc&eacute;, Apollo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from the incident at the gate where Osborne taught the enforcement team members a lesson, he had remained calm in Apollo's presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna almost believed Osborne no longer had any feelings for Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, he would surely show some hostility toward Apollo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing Osborne laugh at Barlyn's mockery of Apollo, Donna finally couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what are you laughing at? Do you also think Apollo is bluffing? And what do you think of Apollo as a person?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback, not expecting Donna to catch his laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought for a moment before replying, "I just found Barlyn's depiction amusing. If Apollo, with all his confidence, gets turned down by Skyefall Security, his reaction should be quite interesting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for what I think of him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't think much of him! While I'm not entirely clear on how powerful the Chevalier family truly is, his arrogance, the way he expects everyone to obey him, rubs me the wrong way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't think he deserves Clarissa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne finished calmly, and Barlyn burst into laughter. "Osborne, you think so too? Haha, great minds think alike!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I also think Apollo doesn't deserve Clarissa at all! If my mom hadn't stopped me, I'd have beaten him up! Who cares about old family legacies? Acting all high and mighty in front of me, what a jerk!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn grumbled angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna glared at him. "Shut up! Do you think if I didn't stop you, you'd be able to beat Apollo? Hmph! Even I might not be his match."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn was surprised at her words. "Is he that strong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna's expression grew serious. "I'm not entirely sure how strong he is. He's been abroad for years, and no one knows his exact capabilities. But I've heard he's famous overseas, known as the Grim Reaper."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Grim Reaper?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Grim Reaper?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Grim Reaper?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn, Clarissa, and Osborne echoed in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn was shocked that Apollo had such an intimidating nickname, which sounded like he had killed many people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa showed visible disgust on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Osborne was simply irritated by the nickname Grim Reaper, finding it presumptuous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "Grim Reaper? The Grim Reaper is Satan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his possession of Satan's Eye, Osborne couldn't stomach anyone daring to call themselves the Grim Reaper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed such a person was unworthy of the title!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna continued, "I've only heard rumors, but Apollo's strength is certainly formidable, possibly stronger than mine. So, don't provoke him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Donna intentionally glanced at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although he's arrogant, some of what he says is true. The Chevalier family is powerful in Skyefall, and even the Draco Group has to show them respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Skyefall Security were still a subsidiary of the Draco Group, they might refuse to lease the Class A defense system to Apollo. But now, the Draco Group has sold Skyefall Security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter who the new owner is, I don't think they'd risk offending the Chevalier family. So, Apollo really might manage to lease the Class A defense system."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she finished, Clarissa frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Donna, even if he succeeds, I won't marry him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna frowned and said, "Clarissa, don't say foolish things! Whether you marry or not is not up to you or me to decide. It's up to Sir Radcliffe. All I can do is try to buy you more time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sighed deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn was anxious. "Mom, what's wrong with our family? Do we really need the Chevalier family to survive? Must we sacrifice Clarissa's happiness? Apollo doesn't deserve her. Why should she marry him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph, if Apollo doesn't deserve her, who does? Besides, your opinion doesn't matter. Can you convince Sir Radcliffe? Can you persuade the elders of the family? If not, then shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna was furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn was also angry and blurted out, "I won't keep quiet! I think Osborne is better than Apollo! I'd rather see Clarissa marry Osborne than Apollo! At least Osborne saved Clarissa's life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly glanced at Clarissa through the rearview mirror, seeing her blush deeply, biting her lip as she looked back at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes met in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne saw defiance and resistance in Clarissa's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, Osborne felt a jolt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You reckless brat, stop talking nonsense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna's angry voice interrupted Osborne's thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna said coldly, "Don't ever say such things again! Otherwise, you'll endanger Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And Osborne, while I appreciate you saving Clarissa several times, you and Clarissa are not suitable for each other. You come from different worlds."</span></p><div class="pagination">
