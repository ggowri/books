  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Osborne began to draw power through the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, to completely annihilate Hubery and the five hundred Deity King-level warriors from various races on Divine Peak Nine, he was pulling out all the stops, holding nothing back and hiding nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After using the power-drawing technique, the divine power within the 400-thousand-strong garrison of Divine Peak Nine started to diminish rapidly. It flowed through the invisible roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity and into Osborne's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of the 400-thousand troops had been given a Celestial Crystal, and over time, they had all made significant advancements in their cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most were now at the Celestial Deity level, while a few had even reached the Deity Overlord level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them were Deity King-level warriors like Chandler and Angelo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their divine power surged through the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity and infused Osborne, who had been feeling somewhat weak. Now, he quickly returned to his peak condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His level also began to ascend rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The divine power of over 400 thousand people was an overwhelming and immense force. Osborne felt like a balloon, rapidly inflating as more and more divine power poured into him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within the blink of an eye, he reached the mid-stage of Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this was just the beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten seconds later, Osborne's level soared to the peak of the mid-stage Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, in an instant, he broke through to the late-stage Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His energy continued to surge uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When all the divine power from the 400 thousand troops in Divine Peak Nine's garrison was drained and channeled to Osborne, his level swelled once more, reaching the pinnacle of Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's divine power was now so vast that even at his level, he struggled to control it, creating massive fluctuations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed like a volcano on the verge of eruption.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery was completely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He watched, wide-eyed, as Osborne, in a very short time, transformed from a weakened state to peak condition. Osborne's level expanded like a balloon, rapidly ascending until he reached the same Deity King peak as Hubery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they were both at the Deity King peak, Osborne's divine power was incomparably stronger. The amount of energy required for him to break through was hundreds of times more than that of an ordinary cultivator, and at the same realm, his divine power was naturally hundreds of times stronger than anyone else's!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Deity King peak, Osborne and Hubery were on entirely different levels now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the divine power radiating from Osborne's body made Hubery tremble with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! This can't be happening!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could this happen? What the hell is going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery was completely thrown into panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne's strength soared, his Spatial Clones and Dark Undeads began to strengthen at an alarming rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of the Spatial Clones and Dark Undead was directly tied to Osborne's own strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stronger Osborne became, the stronger they grew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Osborne reached the pinnacle of Deity King, each and every Dark Undead surpassed the Deity Overlord level and reached Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A million Deity King-level Dark Undeads?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was a terrifying force!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sixty-four Spatial Clones, who wielded half of Osborne's combat power, could all single-handedly take on Hubery and easily defeat him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hubery was now completely panicked, his eyes filled with shock and despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The same went for the others beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their faces showed fear and regret. They regretted following Hubery's orders and pursuing Osborne into Divine Peak Nine. They had thought this was a chance to curry favor with Hubery, a chance to earn some recognition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead, they were faced with a hopeless and terrifying situation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the gaze of a million Dark Undeads, their bodies trembled violently. The overwhelming aura surrounding them made them feel like they were about to beg for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stretched his body, feeling the immense power surging within him and the strength of the Dark Undead and Spatial Clones. He couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This all-out effort is showing just how insanely powerful I am! Even I find it a bit over the top and terrifying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then again, Lord Malevolence has the Undead Cataclysm, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Undead he summons will likely be even more numerous and stronger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of Lord Malevolence quickly dampened his confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with his newfound strength, he was still far from Lord Malevolence's level. The more powerful his realm, the more Osborne felt the overwhelming presence of Lord Malevolence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had his advantages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Lord Malevolence doesn't have spatial power, nor does he have the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. He can't draw power like I can.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as my level isn't too far behind his, I might have a chance to win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For now, I need to deal with these people..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
