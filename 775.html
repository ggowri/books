  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne wasn't surprised at all by this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With the support of his spatial domain, Osborne's abilities were terrifying. He could use attacks like Spatial Prison and Spatial Collapse without expending much energy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Under such conditions, even someone stronger than Osborne would be in serious trouble if they weren't careful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne completely understood Takashi's decision.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it had been him in Takashi's place, he would have made the same choice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, if Takashi thought that breaking his spatial domain would be enough to defeat him, he was dreaming!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That was wishful thinking!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even without the spatial domain, Osborne could still cast Spatial Prison and Spatial Collapse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The only downside was that it would consume a lot of his mental energy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmph!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this point, Osborne couldn't worry about conserving energy. If he didn't show his true strength, the challenges would never end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, Osborne made his move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Spatial Prison!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Spatial Collapse!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Taking advantage of the backlash Takashi was suffering from his self-destruction of the Dark Domain, Osborne unleashed his most powerful spatial abilities without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Takashi's body was instantly trapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His face changed drastically. The backlash from destroying his Dark Domain had been intense, leaving blood trickling from the corner of his mouth. He hadn't fully recovered yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Takashi hadn't expected Osborne to recover so quickly and launch such a devastating attack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, feeling the space around him collapsing, Takashi panicked and unleashed his power in a frenzy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Takashi soon broke free from the Spatial Prison. By then, the Spatial Collapse had fully formed. No matter how fast he moved, he couldn't escape its reach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The terrifying collapse severely injured Takashi, and his right leg was crushed to dust by the collapsing space, disappearing completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ahhh!!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Takashi let out a painful scream, collapsing heavily onto the ground, where he soon lost consciousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne let out a cold laugh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without sparing Takashi a glance, Osborne turned to the other Godsons and said calmly, "Who else thinks I'm not worthy of being on the Godson Rankings? Who wants to challenge me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anyone ranked below me is welcome to step onto the stage. I'll take you all on!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's cold words caused many of the Godsons to pale, especially those ranked lower than him, who felt that Osborne was provoking them. They were furious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yet, in the end, no one stepped forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's display of strength intimidated them. Despite being AA-ranked, his spatial abilities made him extraordinarily powerful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sheer destructive power of his Spatial Collapse left them in awe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emi and Takashi had both fallen to Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If they stepped onto the stage, the outcome would likely be the same.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this point, they had no choice but to acknowledge Osborne's strength and accept that he deserved his place on the Godson Rankings alongside them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No more challengers?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne smiled faintly. Despite the energy cost, his decision to quickly defeat Takashi had paid off. It intimidated many who had considered challenging him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If not, I'll step down from the stage."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Osborne stepped down from the stage and returned to his seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, that was amazing!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ron grinned and gave Osborne a thumbs-up. "Emi and Takashi thought you were an easy target because you're AA-ranked. You gave them a lesson they won't forget. It's so satisfying!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"With your strength, if you wanted, I bet you could climb the rankings even higher. Interested in challenging the next tier?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne shook his head casually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need! I can't reach first place anyway. Whether I'm second or five-hundredth doesn't really matter to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This response dumbfounded Ron.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wait, you're aiming for first on the Godson Rankings? Forget about first place. Even the top ten have the power to go toe-to-toe with S-rank Kings!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"They're all known as Quasi-Kings!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Forget about us. Even Cuthbert Williamson, the star of this Honor Quest, is only ranked thirty-fifth!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And that's the highest rank for anyone in the younger generation!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne raised an eyebrow at that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He asked curiously, "Cuthbert is ranked thirty-fifth on the Godson Rankings? Where can I see the full list?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You don't know?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ron looked surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without saying much, he quickly shared a website with Osborne and explained how to register. Without it, he couldn't get access.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne pulled out his phone and followed Ron's instructions, quickly accessing the website.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Diviner League's website!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then Osborne saw two rankings.</p><div class="pagination">
