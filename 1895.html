  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded resolutely. "Alright! Mila, at least we know your parents are out there, and we have a way to find them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once the God of Night returns, we can ask him directly. We might just uncover the truth about your parents. So please, don't rush!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're all here to help you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he mentioned the God of Night, Osborne couldn't help but clench his fist, a flicker of determination in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't forgotten another reason for his journey to the West Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to find Isa, along with Clarissa, Emma, and Austin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, he needed to understand Isa's connection to the God of Night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumors swirled that Isa was the God of Night's woman, and even the God of Light had confirmed this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But deep down, Osborne refused to believe that Isa would betray him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was determined to find her and clear the air, but he wasn't in a hurry. He knew he was still too weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty years ago, when Isa first left the Blue Planet for Celestara, she had fought to a standstill against one of Lord Malevolence's Nine Dark Sovereigns, Icy Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's power was undoubtedly far superior to Jethro's and perhaps even rivaled that of the God of Light&mdash;she was certainly one of the strongest warriors in the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then there was the God of Night, the most powerful warrior recognized by the entire Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't realize that his desire to find Isa wasn't as strong as it should be. The truth was that he had lost confidence in himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with the formidable Isa and the even more powerful God of Night, he felt a wave of insecurity wash over him. He wanted to grow stronger before confronting them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Phew!" Osborne exhaled, pushing aside the chaotic thoughts swirling in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, I heard that we have been running low on Essence Crystals lately?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, Jethro chuckled. "Who isn't short on Essence Crystals? No matter how many you have, it never seems to be enough! The Hudson family is a Dukedom-level power, so we're managing just fine. Don't worry about it; we're all being careful with our usage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And besides, things will change soon. If you need any Essence Crystals for training or purchases, just let me know! Celestial Crystals are tricky, but when it comes to Ultimate Essence Crystals, I can get you as many as you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Zachary and the others exchanged glances, their expressions a bit odd, but they kept their thoughts to themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro quickly shifted the topic, clearly eager to move on from the discussion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne pressed on. "Grandpa, I'm not asking for Essence Crystals for myself. Since you just gifted us that precious Gale of Netherworld Divine Mark, I thought I'd pass along some of my own Essence Crystals. I have a few that I won't need for now, so why not give them to you for urgent needs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne pulled out a Dimensional Bag and handed it to Jethro.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro accepted it with a reproachful look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing? How can I accept your Essence Crystals? The Hudson family doesn't need them! Keep them for yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to return the bag, but Osborne simply smiled and shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa, this is just a small token of my appreciation! Please take it. There's not much in there anyway, so don't push back. Otherwise, I might just have to return the Gale of Netherworld Divine Mark you gave us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro sighed in exasperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that the Dimensional Bag didn't contain much, he relented. "Alright, fine! Since you insist, I won't be rude about it. I'll accept your kind gesture."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, relieved, "Great! Well then, Grandpa and everyone else&mdash;uncles, aunts, cousins&mdash;we're leaving!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry about us; we'll be careful and will be back before you know it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take care of yourselves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne waved his goodbyes to everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The expressions on their faces were tinged with reluctance, but ultimately, no one voiced their feelings, and they raised their hands in farewell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each member of the Hudson family reciprocated with waves of their own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go! Everyone, step into Hope Haven!" Osborne called to Anastasia and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They exchanged hurried farewells with the Hudson family, then quickly entered Hope Haven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A soft ripple of spatial energy enveloped Osborne, and within moments, he vanished from the Hudson family's estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Jethro couldn't help but sigh as he watched Osborne disappear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing the anxious looks on Zachary and the others, he reassured them, "Don't worry too much. Osborne and I are linked by the Binding Twin Pearl. If he's in real danger, I'll be there to rescue him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For now, focus on your training. I hope that soon, one of you will break through and stand upon the Ascension Stairway, becoming the second Supernal Deity King of the Hudson family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're facing tougher challenges ahead. The calamity looming over the Human Community is growing closer; we all need to get stronger to survive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere became serious among the Hudson family members, their expressions reflecting the weight of the words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, we're eager to cultivate and grow stronger, but the family's Celestial Crystals are running low!" Zachary replied with a wry smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro frowned at this. "Running low on Celestial Crystals? That's indeed a significant problem!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this, he reached into his pocket and pulled out the Dimensional Bag that Osborne had just gifted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After taking a glance inside, Jethro froze in astonishment.</span></p><div class="pagination">
