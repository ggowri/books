  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne frowned, noticing Davy&rsquo;s expression was becoming strained as if he was starting to regain clarity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Is the serum wearing off?&rdquo; Osborne murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He glanced downstairs and saw the chaos beginning to subside. He knew his time was running out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">From Davy, Osborne had already obtained more information than he expected. He knew he couldn&rsquo;t stay here any longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He couldn&rsquo;t kill Davy just yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As the liaison for the Aberrants, Davy&rsquo;s sudden death might disrupt their plans, rendering the information Osborne had gathered less valuable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But he also couldn&rsquo;t let Davy reveal what had just happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Fortunately, Osborne had prepared for this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He took out another vial.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Amnesia drug.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This also came from the Godfather&rsquo;s medical research lab. Along with the truth serum, it had cost Osborne five million dollars. The amnesia drug was said to make anyone who ingested it forget everything that happened in the past half-hour.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The truth serum had proven effective.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was confident in the amnesia drug. He grabbed Davy&rsquo;s jaw and prepared to administer it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But he couldn&rsquo;t resist asking, &ldquo;You run Maelstrom, engage in so many illegal businesses, and serve as the liaison for the Aberrants. You must have a lot of money, right? You wouldn&rsquo;t dare keep it in a bank. Tell me, where do you hide it?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The struggle in Davy&rsquo;s eyes became more and more obvious at this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But he still responded to Osborne&rsquo;s question.&rdquo; My money is hidden in the vault in my villa&rsquo;s basement.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As soon as Davy finished, his eyes cleared, and he suddenly regained his senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Davy was horrified. Though he had been in a trance, he remembered everything upon waking. Thinking about the questions Osborne had asked and his own answers, he felt a chill run through his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Davy struggled wildly. After revealing so many of the organization&rsquo;s secrets, he knew they would kill him if he didn&rsquo;t eliminate Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But his efforts were futile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne had already obtained the information he needed. He grabbed Davy&rsquo;s jaw and forced the amnesia drug into his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Instantly, Davy passed out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When he woke up, he would forget everything that had happened in the past half-hour.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Only then did Osborne stand up, retrieve the micro camera, and combine it with the earpiece to reform a button, which he placed back on his lapel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Time to leave.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne opened the private room door and, while no one was looking, swiftly returned to the first floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The chaos on the first floor soon ended.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne blended into the crowd and quietly left the Maelstrom Boxing Club.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Once back in his car, Osborne removed and hid his human-skin mask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He quickly transferred the footage from the micro camera to his phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Paul, you really are a spy for the Aberrants. With this evidence, Paul is finished. The key now is, once Paul is taken down, how can I replace him as the new head of security?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne pondered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After all, he had only recently become Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard, and Donna greatly distrusted him. Even if Paul was ousted, it wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily mean he would become head of security unless he could earn Donna&rsquo;s absolute trust.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne considered his next steps.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Tomorrow, the Aberrants will attempt to assassinate Clarissa. This will be my chance.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne began to formulate a plan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He drove back to the hospital, his mind on Davy&rsquo;s hidden fortune.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As the leader of Maelstrom and the liaison for the Aberrants, Davy&rsquo;s accumulated wealth over the years must be substantial.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Maelstrom&rsquo;s operations included underground boxing clubs, casinos, drug trafficking, kidnapping of wealthy individuals, and smuggling of guns and cars. They were all highly lucrative businesses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Davy&rsquo;s wealth was likely comparable to that of a wealthy family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne wanted to go to Davy&rsquo;s villa immediately and claim all the money for himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But he restrained his impulse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;To avoid any mishaps, I must wait until after tomorrow&rsquo;s attack, once everything is settled, before going to Davy&rsquo;s villa.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that thought, Osborne returned to the Institute of Human Research.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After checking on Anastasia, he stayed in her room, guarding her while practicing The Breath of Celestial.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tomorrow&rsquo;s attack would be very dangerous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even with the intelligence he had obtained, unexpected events could still occur. Only by being strong enough could he ensure his safety.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was particularly wary of Raymond, the metahuman who could control lightning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">According to Davy, Raymond was a Class C+ metahuman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His abilities surpassed Milo&rsquo;s, and he controlled the terrifying power of lightning. Donna had fought him twice and hadn&rsquo;t been able to capture him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne himself wasn&rsquo;t confident against Raymond.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Most importantly, he had no idea how to defend against lightning attacks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It looks like I need to prepare even more.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that in mind, Osborne opened the Draco Star Wristlet online marketplace and began to browse.</p><div class="pagination">
