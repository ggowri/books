  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A pair of cold, furious eyes glinted through the cracks in a massive cocoon. Suddenly, the cracks widened rapidly. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a powerful roar, a monstrous beast, towering over 160 feet, burst forth. It spread its enormous wings, spanning an impressive three to four hundred yards&mdash;far larger than Osborne's Nightshade Wings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This creature was unlike anything Osborne had encountered. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It resembled a gigantic bird, standing between 160 and 200 feet tall, with claws stretching 40 feet long. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perched on the remnants of its cocoon, its eyes blazed with fury, locked onto Osborne with a deadly intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt exhilaration instead of fear. The cocoon had been a formidable defense; if the Dark Deity had stayed hidden, it would have been tough to eliminate. But now, it was exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get this started!" Osborne shouted, controlling the Abyssal Spiral and directing </span><span>it toward the massive Dark Deity. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, the Abyssal Spiral moved slowly. At its current size of 10,000 feet, it harbored immense power, but Osborne felt the strain of managing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If only I were stronger, I could command the Abyssal Spiral to move swiftly, chasing down and devouring enemies instantly. But right now..." he thought, as he watched the colossal Dark Deity evade the Abyssal Spiral's grasp and charge toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Abyssal Spiral managed to engulf the massive cocoon, yet it remained intact within the swirling vortex, leaving Osborne astonished. "What is that cocoon made of? It's incredibly resilient! This Dark Deity must owe its survival to it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne decided he needed to secure the cocoon and take it back for analysis at the Materials Research Institute. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There might be a chance to uncover a powerful new material. But first, he had to deal with the Dark Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne couldn't subdue it, he wouldn't be able to bring the cocoon back&mdash;or ensure his own safe return. He focused on the Dark Deity as it dove toward him, seemingly ready to attack. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But upon seeing Osborne's calm demeanor, it halted, hovering several hundred yards away. Its massive form began to morph into a middle-aged man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold gaze fixed on Osborne, the man seethed with rage. "You insolent insect! You dare slaughter my offspring, destroy my lair, and interrupt my recovery? I'll kill you, drain your blood, and feast on your flesh!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Deity's aura surged with murderous intent. Osborne simply smiled, not saying a word, focusing on sensing the Deity's aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe he isn't that powerful after all. Is he a Junior Deity? An Intermediate Deity? Or a Superior Deity?" </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wondered. His understanding of divine rankings was limited, as his recent breakthrough had been unexpected. Therefore, he couldn't gauge the Dark Deity's status solely based on its energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had other ways to figure it out. Osborne kept his focus on the Dark Deity while searching through Cain's memories for a method to discern the levels of divine beings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Dark Deity's brows furrowed as Osborne remained silent, a mix of fury and apprehension gripping him. Feeling unbalanced by Osborne's reticence, he hesitated to act rashly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Osborne found what he was looking for in Cain's memories. "So that's how it is!" he murmured. Osborne looked above the Dark Deity's head, where three flickering orange flames hovered&mdash;two burning brightly, while the third was nearly extinguished. These were Divine Flames!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Every deity ignites Divine Flames upon forging a Divine Body. A Junior Deity has one flame, an Intermediate Deity two, and a Superior Deity three... </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Deity King has seven Divine Flames. This Dark Deity has three, making him a Superior Deity. However, the third flame is dim, indicating his powers haven't fully recovered&mdash;he's now equivalent to a top-tier Intermediate Deity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne exhaled with relief. Facing a Superior Deity would have been unwise with </span><span>his current abilities, but an Intermediate Deity&mdash;that was a different story! Moreover, the Dark Deity's Divine Flames were orange, suggesting a Level Two Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level One Divine Bodies burned with red flames. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level Two, like this one, glowed orange. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level Three shined with yellow. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This revealed that this Dark Deity was a top-tier Intermediate Deity with a Level Two Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stage was set for an intense showdown! Osborne's confidence surged as he prepared for battle.</span></p><div class="pagination">
