  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Osborne spotted Isa being pinned down by Lord Malevolence, it felt as if his breath was snatched away. A chill swept through him, the kind that crawled under his skin, igniting a spark of panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How could it be Isa?</span><span> </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How could she be the one facing off against Lord Malevolence? Where's God of Night? Why isn't he stepping up?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic took hold of him, turning into rage as Osborne shouted, "God of Night, you bastard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You let Isa face Lord Malevolence instead of handling it yourself? What kind of messed-up mentor are you?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait until I get my hands on you. I swear I'll make you pay!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ascending Sacred Sanctum, speed up! Now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's urgency clawed at his throat, his face contorted in a mix of fear and fury. He watched in horror as Isa lingered on the edge of death, vulnerable to Lord Malevolence's every move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This anger coursed through him, not just aimed at Lord Malevolence, but also at God of Night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Night was supposed to protect Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whispers had circulated claiming that the God of Night wasn't just her mentor, but also her lover. That rumor had gnawed at Osborne for weeks, filling him with doubt and hurt, leaving him questioning whether Isa would betray him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thoughts of confronting her flashed through his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd contemplated harboring resentment against her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, witnessing her in peril, Osborne realized none of that mattered. Not now&mdash;not when Isa's life hung in the balance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Speed up! Come on!" Osborne roared, his face twisted in rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remaining thirty percent of the ship's propulsion thrusters ignited with a blinding intensity, sending the Ascending Sacred Sanctum rocketing forward in a burst of speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He vowed fiercely, "Lord Malevolence, if you hurt Isa, I'll hunt you down!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you, God of Night, if anything happens to her, I swear you'll regret it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Faster!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, hang in there! I'm coming! Please, don't you dare get hurt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice dripped with urgency, raw and desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind him, the God of Light froze upon hearing Osborne's furious shout and curses, each word heavy with dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't possess the Satan's Eye&mdash;stripped of that power, she remained clueless about the ongoing battle in the distant West Zone. But seeing Osborne's frantic demeanor told her everything she needed to know; things had taken a turn for the worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened her mouth, as if to say something, but faltered, silenced by the urgency rolling off of Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, something incredible happened&mdash;within Osborne's grasp, a wickedly crimson bow materialized&mdash;the Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clutched it tightly, dark energy radiating from him. The distance was </span><span>too far</span><span>; if it weren't for that, he could have shot Lord Malevolence dead in his tracks to save Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get closer! Just a bit closer, damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The urgency clawed at him as he watched the Sanctum of Night attempt to rescue Isa, only for Malevolence Tower to block their path. He saw Clarissa, Emma, and others rushing to help, but they, too, were intercepted, and at that critical moment, Osborne saw Lord Malevolence raise his hand, gathering a fierce, terrifying energy aimed directly at Isa's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that hand came crashing down, Isa wouldn't survive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, it felt like his heart stood still, his blood ran cold. Sounds faded into silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The world around Osborne ceased to exist, his entire focus narrowing on the image within his Satan's Eye&mdash;Lord Malevolence's hand slowly descending toward Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Save her! Save her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I have to save her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But how?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The distance is insurmountable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing it through his Satan's Eye was one thing&mdash;achieving that distance with a rescue attempt from Lord Malevolence was a whole </span><span>different</span><span> beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't do it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this dire moment, Osborne realized that only an Empyrean Sacredness warrior could possibly save Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But him? He was powerless to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Osborne could only stand there, frozen and helpless, as Lord Malevolence's hand slowly reached down towards Isa. Self-loathing welled up in his heart. He yearned to be stronger, to yank her out of this living nightmare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain he was feeling now was far worse than the agony he'd endured when fusing with the World Tree fragment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"NO!" Osborne bellowed, a blaze of rage lighting up inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes turned a fierce shade of crimson. But even with the adrenaline pumping through his veins, his mind was a maelstrom of panic and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a voice rang out in his head. "Hey, use the attack runes of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The familiar voice of Primordial hit him like a thunderbolt, jolting him back to his senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Attack runes?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly scanned his surroundings and winced at the sorry state of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum. Seventy percent of its propulsion runes were gone, and a staggering ninety percent of its defense runes had been wiped out. The attack runes had fared even worse&mdash;ninety-nine percent of them were destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Ascending Sacred Sanctum has practically lost its offensive capabilities. How could it be of any use?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey! Snap out of it! Yeah, most of the attack runes are busted, but they can still pack a punch. Even if it's just one percent of their full might! And let me tell you, the range and speed? They're on par with an Empyrean Sacredness warrior!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only Ascending Sacred Sanctum can help you right now!" Primordial said urgently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a light bulb went off in Osborne's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That's right! The attack runes of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, battered as they are, can still reach crazy distances and strike like a bolt of lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I can never make it to Isa in time, but the Ascending Sacred Sanctum can!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fired up with newfound resolve, he roared, "Ascending Sacred Sanctum, attack!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attack runes crackled to life with a deep, vibrating hum, pulsing with energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a blinding flash, one of the Sacred Crystals at the core exploded into fragments, pouring every last bit of its power into the jury-rigged attack runes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then, a dazzling purple beam rocketed out of the Ascending Sacred Sanctum, cutting through the air like a bullet headed straight for the distant West Zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, at the borders of the West Zone, Isa looked unfazed, a calm smile gracing her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can feel his return."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At those words, Lord Malevolence's expression hardened slightly, but he quickly brushed it off with a cold sneer. "Is the God of Night back? Well, he'll be joining you soon enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you? Even if he arrives, he can't save you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time for you to say goodbye!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he drove his hand down with terrifying force toward Isa, the power surging at his fingertips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't possibly defend against such an onslaught&mdash;this strike would surely shatter her skull and extinguish her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that bleak moment, it seemed there was no hope left to save her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as despair threatened to close in, out of nowhere, a purple flash of light shot in from the distance, faster than anyone could comprehend, striking Lord Malevolence's hand with shocking precision!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Lord Malevolence couldn't react in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The purple flash was simply too quick. All he felt was a sudden stab of pain at his palm, a sensation of his power dissipating into nothingness. He turned his gaze in disbelief to his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A blood hole had appeared in his palm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The purple beam had pierced right through him, and in that split second, Lord Malevolence stood frozen, completely dumbfounded.</span></p><div class="pagination">
