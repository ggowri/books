  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma finally let loose her Death Realm in a fight for the first time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew that even though she'd just cracked into Class AAA, she was no match for Cuthbert without some fancy old gadgets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she had the Swallow Shield, maybe she could go toe-to-toe with him for a while, giving him a run for his money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But here on the stage, she knew she couldn't hold a candle to Cuthbert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without her Death Realm, she'd be just like Rhett, not even worth Cuthbert breaking a sweat. She'd just get her butt kicked and end up looking like a fool.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But with the Death Realm? That's a whole different ball game!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was a loud buzz.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Death Realm spread out, swallowing up Cuthbert in an instant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert sneered."Fool! You know that a realm of your level can't affect me at all. I'll crush it effortlessly, and the backlash will tear apart your mental strength. Yet, you still try to use it against me? What an idiot!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Shatter!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert threw a punch. His terrifying power exploded within Emma's&nbsp;Death Realm, attempting to shatter it like he had with the previous challengers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This time, he miscalculated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His attack struck the&nbsp;Death Realm&nbsp;with a deafening crash, but it only trembled slightly, remaining intact.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert blinked in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma smirked. Her&nbsp;Death Realm&nbsp;was no ordinary field. It was fueled by her&nbsp;Death's Stare, far more stable than typical realms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Cuthbert thought he could easily break it, he was dreaming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was delusional!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Death's Harvest!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a sweep of her hand, a powerful force erupted within the&nbsp;Death Realm, siphoning a portion of Cuthbert's life force. His face paled instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert was shocked as he felt the vitality being drained from him. Though it wasn't fatal, if it continued, it would significantly weaken him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I underestimated you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His expression darkened as he said coldly, "If you think this realm alone will take me down, you're delusional!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Shatter!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert's strength surged even further. His fists pounded relentlessly at Emma's&nbsp;Death Realm, sending waves of force through it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A series of booms echoed through the arena.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The thunderous impacts continued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert's strength was terrifying. Despite the stability of Emma's&nbsp;Death Realm, it trembled violently under his assault and seemed on the verge of collapse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's face grew tense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She clenched her teeth and quickly launched an attack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Death's Harvest!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's&nbsp;Death Realm&nbsp;continued to siphon Cuthbert's life force under her control.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert became even angrier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In just two attacks, Emma had drained at least a tenth of his life force. A few more hits like that, and his strength would be seriously affected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Enraged, Cuthbert unleashed even more devastating power, determined to destroy Emma's&nbsp;Death Realm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Emma's face paled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her right eye trembled violently, with blood slowly trickling out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her&nbsp;Death Realm&nbsp;was on the verge of collapse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmph! Even if I lose, I'll take a piece of you with me! As long as I drain enough of your strength, Osborne will avenge me and defeat you!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Death's Harvest!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Death!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Extinction!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before her&nbsp;Death Realm&nbsp;could collapse, Emma unleashed her most powerful attack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Death's Extinction!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A chilling wave of energy engulfed Cuthbert, extinguishing a significant portion of his life force, causing his face to turn ashen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His life force was drained and extinguished, causing severe damage to his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thud!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cuthbert coughed violently, spitting out blood, his aura fading into weakness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sight left everyone watching in complete shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Supreme Overlord from the Williamson family stood up, visibly stunned, staring in disbelief at Emma and the blood-spitting Cuthbert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He shouted in anger but didn't intervene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was the&nbsp;Honor Quest Ceremony, a fair competition taking place on the stage. He couldn't interfere, especially with other Supreme Overlords present.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he stepped in, the Williamson family would become a laughingstock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My God!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She actually hurt Cuthbert!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What is her realm? Why is it so terrifying? It's not only incredibly stable but can even seriously injure Cuthbert!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Cuthbert spat out blood!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"His aura has weakened; he's injured!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Unbelievable!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd erupted in a frenzy of exclamations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Osborne rushed back. When he saw that it was Emma fighting Cuthbert on the stage, his expression immediately changed.</p><div class="pagination">
