  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought lingering in his mind, Osborne suddenly had a change of heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, he had no interest in the Miracle Elixirs at the Luminous Commerce Center. After all, ten elixirs were hardly enough to make a dent in his plans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He needed at least 10 thousand to help all the Blood Demon members break through to the Deity King level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten elixirs were just a drop in the bucket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he decided he wanted to take a look after all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne turned to the sales associate and said, "I've changed my mind. I'm interested in the Miracle Elixirs! How much do I need to verify?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh...?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The associate stared at him, taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had witnessed Kurt's humiliating Osborne just moments ago and didn't dare say anything. She was well aware of Kurt's reputation as a notorious playboy in Apocalypse City, a young man whose power was unmatched among his peers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was not someone a mere sales associate could afford to offend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What surprised her was that, despite the humiliation, Osborne didn't seem overly angry or eager to avoid Kurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he was choosing to pursue the Miracle Elixirs as well!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The associate thought, "He knows Kurt and his crew are here for the Miracle Elixirs, yet he still wants to check them out? What is he thinking?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her confusion turned to concern, but she maintained her professionalism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, the Miracle Elixirs are located on the fourth floor in the herbal shop. You don't need to verify funds to go to the herbal shop. However, if you want to purchase a Miracle Elixir, you'll need to verify 10 thousand Ultimate Essence Crystals or one hundred Celestial Crystals."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given the value of Miracle Elixirs, it made sense that each would be priced around one hundred Celestial Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He casually pulled out a Dimensional Bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here's one hundred Celestial Crystals. Take a look."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The associate's eyes widened in surprise. One hundred Celestial Crystals was no small amount; even many First-rate Powers might struggle to come up with that kind of cash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, okay!" she stammered, handing the Dimensional Bag back to him, not daring to ask further questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, follow me! The Miracle Elixirs are on the fourth floor!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, she led Osborne to the fourth floor of the mall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere was quieter up there, with only a few shops selling expensive items.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each store was spacious, and the associate guided him into one of the herbal shops.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they stepped inside, they ran right into Kurt and his entourage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Kurt's companions spotted Osborne, their faces registered shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt, however, darkened at the sight of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look who decided to follow me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got some nerve showing your face again. What, you didn't like what I said earlier? I told you to scram, and here you are, still in my line of sight. Are you looking for trouble?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt's voice dripped with disdain as he stepped closer to Osborne, his intent clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne maintained an unruffled demeanor, calmly addressing Kurt, "If I'm not mistaken, this is the Luminous Commerce Center, right? Belonging to the Sanctum of Light, not the Baxter family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is your family so domineering that you think you can dictate who purchases what here? Have you really claimed the Luminous Commerce Center as your own? Does the God of Light know about this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne shot Kurt a disdainful look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt's expression shifted dramatically, his eyes flashing with a hint of panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He retorted, "What are you rambling about?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When did I say this place belonged to the Baxter family? How dare you slander me! You're asking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, the murderous intent in Kurt's gaze deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne simply smiled, "Oh? So you don't view this as the Baxter family's property? Then what gives you the right to tell me to get lost? Just because you think you can shop here doesn't mean I can't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think you have the right to order me around?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't intimidated by Kurt's hostility, pushing back against him without missing a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words left the sales associate and Kurt's entourage stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt himself was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been a long time since anyone in Apocalypse City had dared to speak to him like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Who is this guy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is he out of his mind?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knows who I am, and yet he says these things to me? Is he looking down on me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fury bubbled within Kurt, his rage palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine! I'll remember you! You probably think you can act this way because you know you can't be touched in the Luminous Commerce Center. Just wait! You'll have to leave eventually, and when you do, that's when your time is up! You're as good as dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kurt threatened as he pointed a finger at Osborne, then turned sharply, heading for an inner room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all keep an eye on him! I'm going to grab some Miracle Elixirs first. Once I get them, I'll deal with this punk! He's going to learn the hard way that in Apocalypse City, no one crosses me without paying the price!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Kurt disappeared into a restricted area, leaving behind his entourage, who shot Osborne cold, mocking glares, as if they were watching a condemned man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, paid them no mind and took a few steps toward the inner room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the men exclaimed, his contempt evident, "What do you think you're doing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you're worthy to go in there? That's where they keep the Miracle Elixirs! You should just turn around and get out!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
