  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey stared at the five Divine Flames hovering above Osborne's head with a cruel smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The five flames were a clear indicator that Osborne was still just a Celestial Deity. His recent breakthrough had failed, likely due to their ambush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This realization instantly bolstered Tobey's confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Myron and Sara, observing the same flames, relaxed visibly, their smug grins matching Tobey's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Myron taunted, "So, you didn't make the breakthrough after all. You're still just a peak Celestial Deity! Hahaha, that seals your fate. You're nothing but a lowly human. Even at the same level, you're no match for us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They took their time surveying Osborne, their mocking laughter echoing through the cavern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, why don't you tell us how you ended up in the Royston family's Essence Crystal mine? Were you hiding here, stealing from us to power up for that pathetic little attempt at a breakthrough?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! You should know better than to mess with the Royston family's Essence Crystals! Now that we've caught you red-handed, we're feeling generous. Given that you're a peak Celestial Deity, we'll give you a chance to live.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"All you have to do is beg for mercy and submit to me... submit to Mr. Tobey Bowman. If you do, perhaps Mr. Tobey will spare your life and let you serve him like the dog you are!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Myron's ingratiating gaze fell on Tobey, who nodded in approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! So, beg for mercy. I might just let you live if you grovel enough!" Tobey </span><span>snickered,</span><span> his arrogance palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression remained icy as he observed the three of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside him, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was rapidly healing his injuries, so he wasn't in a rush to retaliate just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Listening to Myron and Tobey, he realized that Tobey was the ringleader of this little band.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His curiosity piqued, and Osborne fixed his stare on Tobey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're a human, yet you have these Upper Race Demonic Dragon Clan members fawning over you? Who the hell do you think you are?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey's face contorted with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You insolent fool! Do you have any idea who I am? I'm Tobey, from the noble Paramount Supreme Clan! How dare you mistake me for a mere lowly human?! "Are you asking for death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Paramount Supreme Clan?" he repeated, scrutinizing Tobey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was his first encounter with a member of this so-called clan, and he couldn't help but notice how identical they looked to the rest of the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, they were members of the Human Community!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scoffed. "Wait a minute. What are you going on about? You're just a human! If you think the Human Community is beneath you, then surely you, the supposed Paramount Supreme Clan, are equally worthless. It's laughable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey's fury simmered over at that remark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're asking for it! I was willing to give you a chance to live, but now I've changed </span><span>my mind. I'll flay you alive and make you suffer the worst kind of death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a furious wave of his hand, he commanded, "Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Myron and Sara advanced, cold smiles twisting their lips. "So, a pathetic little human refuses your chance at mercy and dares to cross Mr. Tobey Bowman? You're asking for disaster! Time to say goodbye!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they lunged at him again, Osborne's face broke into a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't even flinch. "Honestly, I was caught off guard because I was in the midst of my breakthrough. But do you really believe that two pathetic fools like you could ever take me down? You chose to ambush me, so now you'll pay the ultimate price! I'm looking forward to testing my strength after this breakthrough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne unleashed a single, powerful punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Osborne's first strike after breaking through to the rank of Transcendent Deity, facing off against two peak Celestial Deities from the Demonic Dragon Clan. Each of them was stronger than the average Celestial Deity, but to Osborne, they were no more than minor obstacles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he stood tall, poised for combat, he simply launched a single punch, releasing a surge of divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Myron and Sara's combined attacks were shattered, their strikes utterly obliterated by the force of Osborne's blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lightning crackled violently around his fist, and in the blink of an eye, it transformed into two enormous thunderous dragons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These thunder dragons streaked forward at breakneck speed, so quick that Myron and Sara barely had time to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One moment, they were focused on their offense, and the next, the dragons had already slammed into them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of thunder echoed, punctuated by the furious crackle of electricity as Osborne's attack ripped through their divine power defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Myron and Sara's protective barriers shattered upon impact, with their prized divine artifact, the Malevolence Shield, disintegrating as if it were made of glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Malevolence Shield was a top-grade one, reputed to withstand even a Deity Overlord's blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, in the face of Osborne's thunderous fury, it was reduced to nothing within seconds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dragons, while diminished in strength after breaking through the shield, still packed enough power to send both warriors flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They screamed in agony as they were propelled backward, crashing hard onto the ground in front of Tobey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pair landed heavily, their bodies charred and weakened, their Divine Bodies fracturing under the assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vitality in their eyes dimmed; they were not dead yet, but they were as good as.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tobey was left in stunned silence, unable to comprehend the scene unfolding before him. Astonishment filled his gaze as he looked from Osborne to the defeated challengers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe it&mdash;Osborne had almost killed Myron and Sara with a single punch!</span></p><div class="pagination">
