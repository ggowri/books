  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha, you think you can crush us?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a joke!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's face was full of disdain. He wasn't bothered by losing the first battle at the Transcendent Deity Level. After all, the Human Alliance had also won yesterday's Transcendent Deity battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, he delivered seven straight defeats to the Human Alliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, he planned to repeat that streak, driving the Human Alliance's morale into the ground. More importantly, if today's victory continued, the Human Alliance would have to retreat and surrender Peaks City, one of the West Zone's top ten strategic cities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Peaks City was an extremely important strategic stronghold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During past wars launched by the Dark Deity Legion, the Human Community had relied on Peaks City to resist. The city had been fortified with extensive defenses, making it incredibly difficult to breach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they could take Peaks City without shedding blood, it would give them a tremendous advantage in the upcoming full-scale war.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, we must win!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Icy One began selecting participants for the Celestial Deity Level battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you're getting serious, I suppose I should too! Compete in talent? What does the Human Community have to compare with the Paramount Supreme Clan or the Unity Clan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One quickly finalized the lineup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ten thousand Celestial Deity Level elites, all composed of prodigies from the Paramount Supreme Clan and the top ten Upper Races.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We will win this battle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Icy One's face was full of confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other side, God of Light, the God of Light, was caught in hesitation and conflict.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Paramount Supreme Clan lost the first match. For the second, they'll definitely send even stronger prodigies. Winning this round will be incredibly difficult! Even if we win, it'll be a pyrrhic victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should we consider a strategic retreat?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light quickly rejected the idea of retreat, her gaze firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today is the best opportunity. With Osborne and the others, we can catch the Paramount Supreme Clan off guard! Whether we can reignite the Human Alliance's morale depends entirely on how glorious today's results are! Once the Paramount Supreme Clan adjusts tomorrow, achieving a praiseworthy victory will be much harder!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, we have to fight with everything we've got today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her decision made, God of Light began arranging the lineup. As always, it consisted of elite prodigies from the Sanctum of Light&mdash;each personally trained and meticulously selected by her, with a massive amount of resources poured into their growth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each loss pained God of Light deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to win this battle, she had no choice but to send in her elite prodigies&mdash;her best chance at victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For me, for the Human Community, win this battle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light gave the order, and the battle resumed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne silently copied the life essence of the elite prodigies and observed the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This battle was even more intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enemy lineup was composed entirely of prodigies from the Paramount Supreme Clan and the top ten Upper Races. While not their absolute best, they were more than sufficient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the very least, the elite prodigies of the Sanctum of Light were unable to gain any real advantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the battle turned into a war of attrition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne couldn't tell who would ultimately emerge victorious before the battle ended.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne decided to stop watching altogether.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze shifted to the massive Ninefold Heaven's Tower in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a divine artifact of the highest caliber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne realized that even his Satan's Eye couldn't fully penetrate the mysteries of the tower. A strange force cloaked it, blocking his ability to see through it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had encountered a similar situation at the Sanctum of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with his Satan's Eye at its peak&mdash;Level Ten&mdash;he still couldn't see through the Sanctum of Light or the Ninefold Heaven's Tower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A divine artifact of this caliber... If only I could own one! Compared to this, the Malevolence Airship and the Light Airship are nothing but toys."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a twinge of regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I traded with the Creation Herald back then, I should have asked for a divine artifact like this! His treasure vault was so sought after&mdash;even the God of Night and Lord Malevolence wanted to sneak in. He must've had artifacts of this level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't even know if the Creation Herald is dead... If he is, I could raid his treasure vault. But if he's alive, showing up uninvited would be a death sentence..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment but decided to play it safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned his gaze back to the Ninefold Heaven's Tower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once the full-scale war begins, the Nine Dark Sovereigns will be the greatest threat to me! Well, technically... it's the Eight Sovereigns now. Icy Nine is already dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder how strong the rest of them are.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Especially Icy One..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time Icy One appeared, it was only as a projection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So far, Osborne had never seen Icy One's true form and had no idea of his exact strength or cultivation level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But as the leader of the Nine Dark Sovereigns, Icy One must be on the same level as God of Light to dare go head-to-head with her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ascension Seven!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the other Sovereigns are probably at the Ascension Six! Right now, I wouldn't stand a chance against any of them in a direct confrontation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not even with the Absolute Forbidden Zone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, the Absolute Forbidden Zone has no effect on someone five levels above me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I run into the Eight Sovereigns, my only option is to flee!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's thoughts wandered until a sudden commotion snapped him back to attention. He quickly turned to look at the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Celestial Deity Level battle in the arena had just concluded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the result... could only be described as brutal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The arena was drenched in blood and littered with corpses. Only a few dozen were left alive, and fewer than ten were still standing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for anyone unharmed... there wasn't a single one!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was carnage!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, in the end, the Human Community won!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a battle of evenly matched strength, the elite prodigies of the Sanctum of Light endured to the very end, driven by their stronger willpower and hunger for victory, claiming the win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Community had secured another victory in the Celestial Deity Level battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Human Community had now achieved two consecutive victories!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cheers just now came from the Human Alliance. Even if they lost the next six matches, they had already surpassed their performance from the previous two days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone could feel that the Human Alliance's morale had been slightly restored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though, it was just a small improvement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, everyone around Osborne was cheering enthusiastically, but God of Light wore a cold, grim expression. Her fists were tightly clenched, and she showed no signs of joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, nearly all ten thousand of the elite prodigies from the Sanctum of Light had been wiped out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a few dozen had survived!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light felt devastated, but she didn't dare show it. She could only suppress her grief deep inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could sense God of Light's sorrow. He wanted to tell her that those people weren't really dead&mdash;that he could revive them anytime...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, he held back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The fact that I can resurrect others... the fewer people who know, the better. Even if she's God of Light..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, he turned his gaze to his grandfather, Jethro.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Up next was the Deity Overlord Level battle, and representing the Human Community would be ten thousand peak Deity Overlord elites from the Hudson family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could they win this battle?</span></p><div class="pagination">
