  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Terrence daydreamed about the glory days back in Celestara, a sudden tremor jolted him from his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He focused, straining to sense the energies around him, and his expression hardened dramatically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To their shock, waves of power surged from every direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were surrounded!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence's face turned grave, and the atmosphere among the Deschanel Clan grew heavy with tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do we do now?" someone whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in a parallel dimension, Osborne stood alongside Divine Shadow and God of Star, observing Terrence and the others as they reacted to their dire situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow couldn't help but marvel at the unfolding scene, saying, "Spatial power is truly fascinating! The master used to say that the God of Space is the hardest Deity King to kill in Celestara! As long as he wishes it, even when surrounded by a host of Deity Kings, he can slip away without a hitch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He might not be the strongest, but he's certainly the most troublesome!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Experiencing spatial power firsthand, I see the master was spot on&mdash;it's downright absurd!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning her wary gaze to Osborne, she said, "Osborne, you're not using that power to spy on girls in the shower, are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face flushed with embarrassment as he explained, "Grandma Divine Shadow, I've outgrown those childish antics!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I would never use spatial power for something like that! What do you take me for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt wronged because he had never done something like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow chuckled, patting him on the shoulder. "Good to hear! Just remember to behave yourself from now on, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling slightly flustered, Osborne quickly shifted the topic. "Grandma Divine Shadow, Terrence just mentioned that Blue Planet is connected to Celestara. What's your take on that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, Divine Shadow's expression turned serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been thinking along those lines too. We survived the cataclysmic war of the Age of Gods and then fell into a deep slumber. We were resting on the eastern continent of Celestara... and when we woke up, we found ourselves in this new world, Blue Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This place is tiny&mdash;maybe just a fraction of the size of what Celestara used to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I'm right, the God of Space must have forcibly severed a piece of land from the eastern continent, purged it of the scent of death, and created Blue Planet as a refuge for life to flourish again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since it's all about spatial power, you'd know better than I do... Blue Planet must have been carved out from Celestara, meaning there are probably one or more dimensional portals connecting the two worlds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we can find those portals, we can return to Celestara! After the war, Celestara was suffocated by death's lingering essence, making survival nearly impossible, even for Deity Overlords.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those who managed to live through it had to resort to their own methods of entering slumber to weather the storm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, after billions of years of regeneration on Blue Planet and a thousand years passing in Celestara, the air should be much clearer. Surviving there shouldn't be too difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Plus, Celestara has complete laws of heaven and earth; it's the only place where we can break through from Transcendent Deity to higher realms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't just think only Terrence wants to return; I do, too! I've been searching for those dimensional portals for years, but so far, no luck."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Divine Shadow finished, God of Star nodded in agreement, a glimmer of nostalgia in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right; I want to go back to Celestara too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked at the two women with astonishment, thinking to himself, "They all want to go back to Celestara? Is it really that much better there? The area is thousands, maybe tens of thousands of times larger than the Blue Planet. I wonder what it's really like..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I get the chance, I'd love to see it for myself," he murmured under his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Images of Isa, Clarissa, Emma, and Austin floated through his mind, and a pang of longing tugged at his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa and the others should be in Celestara by now, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa always said I wasn't strong enough. Was it because the old me couldn't survive in Celestara? But now, I'm an Intermediate Deity. Killing a Transcendent Deity warrior wouldn't be difficult for me. Surely, I can survive in Celestara now, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I should be able to help Isa, shouldn't I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sudden urgency welled up inside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to get to Celestara as soon as possible! I have to wrap things up on the Blue Planet and then find a dimensional portal leading to Celestara. I have to reunite with Isa and the others!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Determination burned in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For others, finding a dimensional portal to Celestara might be an impossible task, but for him, it wouldn't be that hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he was a spatial metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But first things first&mdash;he needed to deal with the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><div class="pagination">
