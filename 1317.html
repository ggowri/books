  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the ranks of the Draco Armed Services Branch swelled to an impressive 100 thousand members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, even with such numbers, countless individuals continued to seek entry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Augustine family had established itself as the most formidable force among the surrounding nations. Powerful factions across dozens of countries willingly submitted to their authority, eager to bask in the glory of the Augustine family's meteoric rise. Who wouldn't want to be part of that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joining the Draco Armed Services Branch meant a chance to soar to new heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Members received top-notch training, access to the coveted "Genius Cultivation Serum," and the opportunity to train within the Augustine Bastion, where they could tap into a hundredfold increase in natural energy. The potential for rapid advancement was staggering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, everything was looking up for the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this period, rival factions like the League of Divine Descent and the Eityreia Organization, which had once held grudges against the Augustine family, seemed to have vanished. Perhaps the destruction of the Deschanel Clan had instilled fear in them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the notorious Beast Tide was gradually receding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't just Rosmandi or the neighboring countries; the Beast Tide was dissipating on a global scale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dark Exotic Beasts and Dark Deities appeared to have all but disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this climate, the power of the Augustine family surged rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Augustine Bastion buzzed with energy as over 100 thousand new recruits from the Draco Armed Services Branch were granted permission to train within its walls. With the abundance of natural energy available, their strength was escalating at an impressive rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the power of the Augustine family members was also on the rise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each day, numerous family members broke through to become true deities, forging Divine Bodies that were at least Level Three, far surpassing those of ordinary Junior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the most remarkable progress was seen among the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had distributed the collected blood energy evenly among the two thousand Junior Deity Blood Demon members, with only a handful directly breaking through to Intermediate Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, as time passed, the majority began to advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After half a month, every single Blood Demon member had successfully transitioned to Intermediate Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All four thousand eight hundred of them stood at this new level of power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was worth noting that even Sebastian, Anastasia, and Bryce&mdash;who possessed greater innate talent and had forged Level Five Divine Bodies&mdash;were still only Junior Deities at this point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their cultivation speed was indeed faster than most, but they still required time to absorb and refine the natural energy around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was not something that could be rushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless, of course, Osborne decided to transform them into Blood Clan descendants as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that was not on Osborne's agenda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he was teetering on the brink of his own breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the bustling Augustine Bastion thrummed with activity, the uppermost levels were eerily quiet. Only Osborne remained there, deep in meditation, striving to ascend to Superior Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After weeks of relentless absorption and refinement of energy from the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, Osborne had amassed an overwhelming reservoir of divine power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had fully reached the level of Superior Deity, and now, his Divine Body began its long-awaited transformation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying force erupted from Osborne's being, sending shockwaves through the Augustine Bastion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire fortress trembled violently, causing the countless inhabitants within to look up in astonishment and alarm, feeling the immense power radiating from its source.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the vibrations intensified, countless dark particles began to seep from Osborne's pores&mdash;impurities from his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though his previous Divine Body had been astonishingly powerful, possibly even stronger than a Level Seven Divine Body, it was not without flaws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with his Divine Body undergoing this renewed transformation, these blemishes were being expelled, purifying his Divine Body to an almost crystalline perfection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, both his Divine Bone and Divine Flesh glowed brilliantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The radiance was translucent, indistinguishable from the Ethereal Glow of a Waste Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Osborne knew deep within that he had become ten times stronger than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the metamorphosis of his Divine Body was completed, he finally reached the pinnacle of his current ambition: Superior Deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes flew open, shining with brilliant light that illuminated the vast training room like a spotlight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally, I've done it!" he exclaimed, rising slowly to his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His bones crackled with a chorus of pops as blood surged through his veins like a roaring river.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne felt an overwhelming tide of strength coursing through him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A smile spread across his face, radiating confidence. He mused, "The true sensation of breaking through to Superior Deity is far more exhilarating and potent than merely borrowing the power of my Blood Demon members to temporarily reach this level!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, I might only be at the early stages of Superior Deity, but if I were to face Terrence again, I bet I wouldn't even need three moves&mdash;just one!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Defeating a warrior of Transcendent Deity status should be a walk in the park for me now! Not even the top-tier Transcendent Deities would stand a chance against me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is there anyone left on Blue Planet who can match my power?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
