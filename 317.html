  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a mansion on the north side of Pinchide City, Osborne took off his large hat and sunglasses, revealing an utterly ordinary face that wouldn't stand out in a crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was wearing a skinmask, a new one he had just purchased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The previous skinmask had been exposed too many times, and Osborne worried it might attract unwanted attention. Thus, he bought several more to store in his Dimensional Space for easy identity changes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, he came to meet Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After he disguised himself, he directly opened a dimensional rift and left the Augustine Estate without anyone noticing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This mansion was where Isa had settled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa seemed to hear the commotion and came down from upstairs. Seeing Osborne's ordinary face, she couldn't help but smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boy, take off that skinmask. Your real face is much more pleasant to look at. Although I hate to admit it, you are indeed getting more handsome."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, she walked to the coffee machine and began making coffee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Would you like some?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne removed the skinmask and smiled, "Less sugar, please."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then asked curiously, "How did you recognize me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled faintly, "The skinmask from the Draco Group are indeed exquisite, almost indistinguishable from the real thing. Just by looking at your face, I couldn't tell. But your scent is unmistakable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed, "You recognize my scent? Do you have any designs on me? Are you craving my body?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa froze for a moment, and then her cheeks flushed slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, she was facing away from Osborne, so he couldn't see her reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She retorted coldly, "If you want a beating, I can oblige! Don't think that just because you've learned a few tricks from me, I can't take you down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and raised his hands in surrender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, it was my mistake!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa snorted, bringing two cups of coffee over to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked irritably, "So, what do you need? I'm starting to regret accepting your gift of the sword hilt. The thought of future troubles is giving me a headache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can I return the sword hilt?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled. "If you can bear to part with it, go ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa glared at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She definitely couldn't bear to part with it; she even held it while sleeping, staring at the dazzling diamond, feeling delighted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, what's the matter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne put away his joking demeanor and said seriously, "I want to ask you to accompany me on a trip to sea. It might be dangerous, and I'm not entirely confident. I hope you can back me up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa sipped her coffee and said calmly, "Accompany you to sea? It's not impossible, but what's in it for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Money?" Osborne ventured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa replied indifferently, "I'm not short on money right now. Let's talk about it when I am."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, should I offer myself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't resist making another joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa paused, then laughed. "It's not out of the question. After all, you're the heir to Godfather, with the best genes in the world."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked Osborne up and down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, you're quite handsome. I wouldn't be at a loss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, it was Osborne's turn to be stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He coughed and said seriously, "Alright, no more jokes! This trip might involve facing many strong opponents. Do you still need experimental subjects? They would be perfect targets. I can capture some for your experiments."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! Since I've already boarded your pirate ship, when is the departure? I need to make arrangements. But let me make this clear. Unless you face an opponent you absolutely can't handle, and your life is in danger, I won't intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, it won't be good for your growth."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. He had asked Isa to come along just in case he encountered someone he couldn't handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For most situations, he was confident in handling them himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deal! I'll have someone deliver the tickets to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne downed the bitter coffee and prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you going to check on Anastasia and Zoe?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled slightly and said casually, "I've already seen them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately realized his mistake as his expression froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, he felt a terrifying fury emanate from Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne knew he was in trouble and quickly opened a dimensional rift, intending to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before the rift could fully open, Isa shattered it with a kick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, she appeared before him, gripping his shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face was frosty. "Kid, you really have X-ray vision!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Admit it, have you been peeping at me all along? No wonder your gaze was always so strange before. You've been doing such perverted things!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that you've seen my body, how are you going to take responsibility?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
