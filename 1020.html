  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giovanni's eyes lit up with excitement as he heard the question. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine, we've indeed made some discoveries!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two months ago, the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> had waged a war, seizing numerous rare metal mines from the Draco Group and taking away large amounts of what they termed the Divine Bone Crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was then that Osborne and Sebastian realized that these seemingly worthless pyrite stones, discarded by miners, were not ordinary pyrite at all but rather a substance imbued with divine power&mdash;the Divine Bone Crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From that moment, Sebastian had all varieties of minerals from the mines sent to the Materials Research Institute, where Giovanni led a team to reanalyze each one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian wanted to know if there were other hidden treasures among the stones, like the Divine Bone Crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, too, was intensely curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The League of Divine Descent's voracious interest in the Draco Group's rare metal mines suggested to him that beyond the Divine Bone Crystal, there must be other valuable minerals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What have you found?" Osborne eagerly inquired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giovanni quickly replied, "Mr. Augustine, over the past few weeks, our team meticulously examined every one of the 1465 different types of minerals. Among these, we identified something peculiar in twelve samples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, eleven of those turned out to be not useful, misidentified due to outdated testing equipment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yet one material stands out&mdash;our testing apparatus can't test its exact composition! I'm almost certain it has some unique energy, similar to the Divine Bone Crystal but distinct in its own way."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Show me immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to contain his eagerness, Osborne followed Giovanni to the research lab.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, Giovanni emerged, holding a glass dish containing a dark red crystal that resembled an ordinary ruby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giovanni announced, "Mr. Augustine, this is it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This mineral is definitely not a common ruby and remains unnamed for now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at the dark red crystal in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Crystal of Life?" Osborne exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giovanni looked at Osborne in astonishment. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Crystal of Life? Mr. Augustine, you know what it is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Osborne scrutinized the crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, he had sensed a crystal embedded deep within Anastasia's brain, which was almost identical to this one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa had told him it was the Crystal of Life&mdash;a substance found only in the brains of </span><span>humans nurtured by </span><span>Celestara</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celestara</span><span>, now saturated with the scent of death, was uninhabitable for ordinary humans. The Crystal of Life, however, could filter out this deadly scent, allowing life to live on </span><span>Celestara</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt an overwhelming surge of vitality emanating from the crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This has to be the Crystal of Life," Osborne said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brows, the wheels in his mind turning. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could there be a Crystal of Life in the Draco Group's rare metal mines? This shouldn't be a natural mineral; it should be a unique 'organ' of the </span><span>Celestara</span><span> people! Did someone from </span><span>Celestara</span><span> die here in the mining area?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly asked Giovanni, "How many of these Crystals of Life in our rare metal mines?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Giovanni shook his head vigorously. "Not a lot, but not exactly a handful either!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Every rare metal mine produces such&mdash;uh, Crystals of Life! We never recognized the energy they contained before; we just assumed they were regular rubies. It puzzled us why every mine seemed to have rubies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only now do we realize their significance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Every rare metal mine can annually produce about fifty of these Crystals of Life! We still have many stocked in our warehouse, waiting to be sold!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once we discovered its uniqueness, we immediately reached out to the sales department to stop any sales of these 'rubies.' We've even traced back all previously sold ones, making every effort to buy them back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood there dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pondered, "Every rare metal mining site has Crystals of Life? Fifty of them a year? How is that even possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that the Crystals of Life in the mines are different from the one in Anastasia's brain? Are these genuine natural minerals?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, how could each rare metal mine have </span><span>Celestara</span><span> people visiting and then tragically perishing there in dozens?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt that this was a far more complex situation than it appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze drifted back to the Crystal of Life, a thought surfacing in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if I could absorb some of the immense vitality in the crystal? Wouldn't that do wonders for my body?" Osborne wondered.</span></p><div class="pagination">
