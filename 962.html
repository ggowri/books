  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's eyes burned with a wild intensity as he seized the moment. With Gerardo's divine power in turmoil, he unleashed the Light of Redemption, breaking free from his petrified state, and lunged toward Gerardo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He swung the Goddess of Grain's scythe down with all his might, knowing this could be his one shot at salvation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In that instant, Gerardo was too preoccupied with containing the chaotic energy around him to notice. After all, the threat of the divine power spiraling out of control was far more pressing than a Class AAA opponent like Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This power belonged to a god, and even though the Medusa deity was dead, her essence was not something just anyone could wield. If Gerardo failed to rein in that chaotic energy, even his top-tier S-class status wouldn't save him from oblivion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But just as Osborne's scythe descended, a terrifying force erupted from Gerardo's body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The scythe never connected; instead, Osborne was violently hurled backward, blood spilling from his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn it!" Osborne spat, his face contorted in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gerardo was now enveloped in a swirling mass of chaotic divine power. While it hampered him, it also acted as a shield, repelling any attacks aimed at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's desperate attempt to strike was met with an explosive backlash that sent him sprawling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If that divine power dissipated, it would mean Gerardo had regained control.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that point, Osborne would have no chance at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The grim realization hit him like a ton of bricks, and he quickly abandoned his attack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I need to run!" Osborne thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With Gerardo preoccupied with subduing the chaotic power, now was the perfect time to escape.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without a second thought, Osborne dashed back to Sebastian's side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grandpa, we need to get out of here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian was in dire straits. His injuries were severe; if they didn't get him medical attention soon, he might not make it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He nodded weakly, understanding the gravity of the situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne wasted no time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He tore open a dimensional rift, pulling Sebastian into it just as Gerardo's furious gaze locked onto them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gerardo roared, "Sebastian! Osborne!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You can't escape!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But before he could act, he doubled over, spitting blood. The backlash from the chaotic divine power had taken its toll, forcing him to focus on suppressing it instead of pursuing them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn it! You're lucky this time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But mark my words, even if you get away today, your fate won't change! Once I've fully merged with the Medusa deity and mastered her divine power, your end will come!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll be at Rosmandi soon, and I'll eliminate everyone connected to you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gerardo's voice echoed with madness, but he could do nothing but watch as Osborne and Sebastian slipped away through the rift.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Finally out of there!" Osborne breathed, adrenaline coursing through him as they traversed dimensions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They traveled nearly 600 miles before he finally halted, breathless and anxious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grandpa, are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian looked painfully weak. The injuries he had sustained were catastrophic. The explosion from the divine artifact had left a gaping hole in his chest, and he had taken more damage while trying to shield Osborne from Gerardo's attack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Light Realm! Light of Redemption!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne gritted his teeth, channeling the Light Realm and unleashing the Light of Redemption in a desperate attempt to mend Sebastian's grievous wounds. While he managed to heal most of the exterior injuries, the deeper damage inflicted by Gerardo's divine power was another story entirely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite the limitations of his ability, Osborne refused to back down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Every three minutes, he would call upon the Light of Redemption again, striving to piece together what remained of Sebastian's health. Though the results were far from miraculous, he could see Sebastian's condition slowly improving, even if only a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, I'm not done yet. I won't kick the bucket just yet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian managed to grunt, slowly propping himself up. He looked at Osborne, and a satisfied smile creased his lips, a semblance of pride shining through his pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Relief washed over Osborne like a cool breeze after a scorching day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grandpa, let's get you back to Newport City! The medical research facility there has to have the capability to treat these injuries!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian shook his head slowly. "That won't do any good. Gerardo's divine power struck right at the core of my strength. The folks at the research facility can't fix what's been broken. My very foundation has been shattered. Even if I survive, I'll just be a shell of a man, powerless and useless."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sebastian's eyes grew heavy with despair, but then, as if recalling a cherished memory, he forced a smile. "But that's okay!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You've grown into your own man. You're more than ready to inherit everything I've built.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Take me back. I'm going to announce to everyone that you're the one taking my place and becoming... the new Godfather!"</p><div class="pagination">
