  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, who also possessed Satan's Eye, was well aware of its immense power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen's current action meant that he was going to launch a mental attack next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Satan's Eye at level five could project illusions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Illusion Projection was a formidable mental attack. Osborne had used it to defeat many enemies. As long as their mental strength and defense were inferior, they would be affected and fall into a brief state of unconsciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only difference was the length of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even a moment of distraction was enough to decide the outcome when it was a fight between masters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Osborne did not dare to be careless with mental attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, Owen's Satan's Eye had reached level six!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A new ability, Memory Control, was unlocked!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was also a mental attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just more bizarre and required more powerful mental power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his sixth-level Satan's Eye, Owen's mental power was undoubtedly stronger than Osborne's. Therefore, the mental attack would inevitably affect him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his Satan's Eye were also activated, Osborne would not be afraid of Owen's mental attack because his mutated Satan's Eye had enhanced defenses against mental power and could repair both mental and soul damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he was unwilling to expose his Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least, he needed to hide it from Owen and Evelynn. Otherwise, it would be difficult for him to explain why he possessed the inherited power of the Augustine family from Newport City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, it would be very troublesome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How should he resist Owen's mental attack without relying on his Satan's Eye?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne instantly figured it out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened the dimensional space and took out an ancient bronze mirror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bronze Mirror emitted a faint light, protecting his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a defensive ancient magic weapon specially designed to defend against mental attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Owen's mental attack broke out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a buzz, a more intense light erupted from the Bronze Mirror, deflecting most of Owen's mental attack. Only a small portion managed to slip through a crack in the mirror and penetrate Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some illusions quickly appeared, but they had minimal impact on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he still feigned confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Owen sneered, "An ancient magic weapon for mental defense? Unfortunately, it still can't stop my mental attack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen swiftly approached Osborne and reached out to grab his throat, aiming to subdue him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could touch Osborne, Osborne's long-prepared attack suddenly erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He threw a punch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the Ninefold Tide Crash!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a panic, Owen finally realized that Osborne was not affected by his mental attack at all but had been deliberately disguising himself to trick him into getting closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no time to dodge or even to use his mind-control defense to protect himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are the loser!" Osborne shouted coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, his powerful fist slammed into Owen's chest, and Owen could only release a burst of Devil's Light at level three around himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, it couldn't resist Osborne's immense power and shattered instantly. The force surged directly into Owen's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen coughed up a mouthful of blood as his body was hurled backward, crashing heavily to the ground and creating a massive crater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Owen!" Evelynn exclaimed in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen was actually knocked away by Osborne's punch. Moreover, he was injured and vomited blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie and the others were also shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never imagined that Osborne could harm Owen. They even thought that Osborne would be unable to withstand a single attack from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the first person to be injured was Owen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charlie and the others felt slapped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't come over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen's voice, now devoid of its previous calmness, carried a cold chill that halted Evelynn in her tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, he flew out of the pit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He appeared slightly disheveled, with blood staining his clothes. As he looked down, his face even contorted with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Osborne and said coldly, "You've impressed me! I didn't expect that you could deceive me. I was careless, but from now on, you'll have no chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will show you my true strength!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying force suddenly burst out from Owen's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dark clouds suddenly covered the sky, and thunder roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lightning elemental power?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was surprised. It was not because Owen wielded lightning elemental power. After all, his Satan's Eye could devour elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, it was because his lightning elemental power appeared to be quite unusual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrifying energy gathered at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen waved his hand, and suddenly, endless lightning descended and converged in his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, a bolt of ball lightning formed there, growing increasingly bright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is ball lightning?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne felt his hair stand on end as his Satan's Eye throbbed wildly, signaling a grave danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, take my Thunder Explosion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The intermediate application of Thunder Power, Thunder Explosion!!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen waved his hand, and suddenly, the frightening ball of lightning arrived in front of Osborne at a blinding speed in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It erupted with a deafening roar, filling the area around Osborne with crackling bolts of lightning.</span></p><div class="pagination">
