  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finding a specific shop in a sprawling city was no small feat, even for someone like Osborne, who had ascended to godhood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, after purchasing a specialized terminal wristband designed for the Human Community, things became much easier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wristband featured navigation capabilities, making it significantly simpler to get around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Manufactured by the Luminous Research Institute, the device required verification of a Human Community identity before it could be used.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Equipped with this wristband, Osborne felt confident he wouldn't get lost in the West Zone again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It also enabled long-distance communication, which was a bonus. The price was surprisingly reasonable&mdash;only one hundred low-grade Essence Crystals each.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bought a dozen, preparing one for Anastasia, Zoe, and Sebastian, while opting not to get one for Darren and First.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those two were part of the Blood Clan, and through the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, he could always reach them whenever he needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the terminal wristband in hand, Osborne quickly located the Luminous Commerce Center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, he stood before its imposing structure, which resembled a temple, a smaller version of the Sanctum of Light itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but marvel at its grandeur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "So this is a miniature Sanctum of Light? I can only imagine how massive the real one must be! I'd love to see the Sanctum in person and witness the strength of the God of Light, who is the pillar of the Human Community today! I wonder what realm she is in...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jethro from the Hudson family is an Ascension Two Supernal Deity King, while Cicero from the Baxter family is an Ascension Three. The God of Light must be even stronger than them; otherwise, she wouldn't be the backbone of the West Zone. I'd wager she's at least an Ascension Four Supernal Deity King, possibly even Ascension Five!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wonder how many tiers there are among the Supernal Deity Kings..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lost in thought, Osborne stepped inside the Luminous Commerce Center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost instantly, a beautiful woman approached him with a welcoming smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, sir! How can I assist you today? I'm a sales associate at Luminous Commerce Center. If you're looking to buy something, just let me know and I can show you around!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne momentarily fell into a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like he had suddenly been transported back to the Blue Planet, strolling through a familiar shopping mall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything about this place&mdash;the layout, the decor, the style&mdash;was reminiscent of the top shopping centers back home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Energy stone-powered lights illuminated the place brilliantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even spotted an elevator&mdash;or rather, an energy lift powered by Essence Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne felt like he was in the Blue Planet again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir? Are you still with me?" the sales associate asked, pulling him from his reverie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaking his head, Osborne replied, "Could you tell me more about this place?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sales associate smiled brightly, "Of course, sir! Everyone who visits Luminous Commerce Center for the first time is always amazed by our decor and layout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You see, everything here has been personally designed by the esteemed God of Light!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne blinked in surprise. "Wait, what? The God of Light designed all this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Her style is so different from everywhere else&mdash;where did she learn it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The associate looked a bit taken aback. "I'm not really sure about the details!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I've heard that during her travels, the esteemed God of Light visited a secluded Dimensional Microcosm. She drew inspiration from that place and transformed Luminous Commerce Center into what you see now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But beyond that, I can't say much more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood there, momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "A secluded Dimensional Microcosm? Is she talking about the Blue Planet? For Celestara, it could absolutely be classified that way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So the God of Light has actually been to the Blue Planet?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did she even stroll through a shopping mall there? And not too long ago, either! After all, that kind of shopping experience only emerged on the Blue Planet because of advancements in technology!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strange feeling washed over him at this realization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The associate offered eagerly, "Sir, is there anything you'd like to buy? I can take you to the sections. We have a ton of great items&mdash;from Sanctum Level Light Airships to terminal wristbands, various divine artifacts, equipment, and even Miracle Elixirs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have Miracle Elixirs? Let's go check those out! Oh, and I want to see one of those Sanctum Level Light Airships while we're at it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The associate paused, visibly surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure about that, sir? You do understand that Sanctum Level Light Airships are incredibly pricey! You'll need to verify your funds before we can take a look..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked somewhat apologetic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled. "How exactly do I verify my funds?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll need to prove that you have at least 100 thousand Ultimate Essence Crystals or one thousand Celestial Crystals to proceed."</span></p><div class="pagination">
