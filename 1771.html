  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't rush to elevate his own strength. Instead, he sought out his grandfather, Sebastian, along with Divine Shadow and God of Star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These three were the most in need of Miracle Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their talents and potential were all but exhausted, making it nearly impossible for them to break through to the Deity King level, even with an abundance of Celestial Crystals to enhance their capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the arrival of Miracle Elixir changed everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The yellow Miracle Elixir directly boosted their Divine Bodies, while the blue one enhanced their elemental essences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these elixirs, they would soon meet the criteria to transcend and become Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, Osborne approached First.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation with the Blood Demon members was somewhat similar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were also hindered by a lack of potential and talent, trapping them at the peak of Deity Overlord. Though Celestial Crystals had improved their potential significantly, there was still a way to go before they could qualify as Deity Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For them, the most straightforward solution remained the Miracle Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had managed to gather over a thousand doses of Miracle Elixir from around Divine Peak Nine, yet he knew it wouldn't be enough to allow all the Blood Demon members to ascend to Deity King status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He estimated that each Blood Demon member would need two doses to compensate for their shortcomings in talent and potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With only a thousand doses available, that meant a maximum of five hundred Blood Demon members could achieve their breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he needed to reserve enough Miracle Elixirs for Anastasia, Zoe, and others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought, "We'll focus on getting a portion of the Blood Demon members to go through first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Let's set the first batch at three hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'll need six hundred doses to elevate to Deity King, leaving us with four hundred doses for the others. Once we acquire more Miracle Elixirs, we can help the rest of the Blood Demon members ascend as well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had scoured the outskirts of Divine Peak Nine clean of Miracle Elixirs, and to find more, he would have to venture deeper into the divine peaks. However, deeper within lay the treacherous Shadow Terror Fiends and root-like creatures, making it too risky for him to take that plunge just yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remembered that Celestara had a total of forty-two divine peaks. If given the chance, he wanted to scout each one thoroughly. Even scouting the outskirts should comfortably allow all members of the Blood Demon clan to break through to Deity King status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he didn't feel the pressure to rush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Getting three hundred Blood Demon members to achieve Deity King was plenty for the time being. With their teamwork and coordination, three hundred Deity Kings could easily smash through a Dark Deity Legion of a million.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these thoughts settled, Osborne spoke decisively, "First, pick out three hundred members. We'll use the Miracle Elixir to get them through to Deity King as quickly as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First nodded respectfully. "Absolutely, Mr. Augustine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having sorted that out, Osborne turned to his own matters and began his final retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He focused inward, assessing his progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My Satan's Eye has reached Level Ten, and I can't elevate it any further. Its power will only increase as my own level rises.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My Divine Body has also reached its peak. It seems both have hit Level Ten, which signifies a limit!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like back on Blue Planet, where transcending beyond the Transcendent Deity level was impossible due to the constraints of the celestial laws.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The limit imposed by Celestara should be the Deity King level. Both my Divine Body and my power have caps at Level Ten. In Celestara, reaching above Level Ten simply isn't an option!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne pondered his next steps, a sudden thought struck him. It was World of Racial Convergence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lord Malevolence hailed from that very realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the World of Racial Convergence, Lord Malevolence ruled over an empire, but it was far from the strongest. In fact, many powers there dwarfed his own, and the warriors were even more fearsome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they hadn't been so formidable, Lord Malevolence wouldn't have been defeated and exiled to Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne murmured, and determination flashed in his eyes, "World of Racial Convergence could very well be a world more advanced than Celestara! It might hold the key to breaking through the Deity King's limits and even surpassing Level Ten!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he quickly reminded himself, "Now isn't the time to dwell on the World of Racial Convergence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"While my Divine Body and Satan's Eye have both hit their Level Ten limits, my elemental essence is still lagging behind, barely reaching Level Eight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to focus on boosting my elemental essences right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recalled the three primary powers he specialized in dark, spatial, and Thunder powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Currently, each was at the peak of Level Seven, tantalizingly close to breaking into Level Eight. "It's time to down some blue Miracle Elixir and push myself to the max!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blue Miracle Elixir was designed to enhance elemental essence, and as he consumed it, he could feel his energy surging, rapidly climbing to new heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he also took a black Miracle Elixir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This particular elixir was known to strengthen the soul and enhance comprehension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Osborne's soul had already been amplified tenfold due to the Deity King Tribulations, making it incredibly powerful, who wouldn't want to grow even stronger?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he consumed the elixirs, time slipped away.</span></p><div class="pagination">
