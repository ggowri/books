  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's feeling upon entering the Enlightenment State this time was completely different from every previous time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He seemed to be in the midst of chaos.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt as if he were wrapped in egg fluid, inside an egg about to hatch, or as if he had returned to the womb, nestled in the placenta.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt as if there was nothing around him, yet everything at the same time&mdash;time, space, elemental forces, and the world had all vanished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the key is, Osborne felt very comfortable.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He felt warm all over, with every cell in his body exchanging information and energy with the outside, as if merging with his surroundings.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wished he could stay in this state forever and never wake up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this state, he didn't notice the intense changes happening within his body. His body, soul, and even Sacred Power were rapidly advancing until they reached a limit, and Osborne suddenly regained some consciousness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My cultivation level can't be suppressed anymore! I'm about to break through to Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment Osborne regained consciousness, his expression changed involuntarily, and he grew a bit anxious.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I can't break through! I still need to participate in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel and enter Necropolis City! If I break through to Empyrean Sacredness now, I'll lose the chance to join the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, won't be able to enter the Royal Sepulcher of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, won't be able to pay respects to my mother from my past life, won't be able to..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, a strong obsession arose in Osborne's mind at this moment&mdash;</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He must not break through to Empyrean Sacredness yet!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment, his body was like a balloon, with Sacred Power surging wildly. No matter how Osborne tried to suppress it, the Sacred Power kept growing. If he didn&rsquo;t break through his cultivation level soon to make his body a larger vessel, the terrifying Sacred Power would burst his body apart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What should I do?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne couldn&rsquo;t stop the rise of Sacred Power. If he didn&rsquo;t want to break through his cultivation level, he had to find a way to prevent this surging power from bursting his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Release it outside?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly dismissed this idea. His body was a closed container, and forcibly releasing the surging power would be like creating a hole in the container.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Creating a hole is easy, but returning to normal would be difficult.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Doing so would not only release the surging power but also his potential, talent, vital essence, soul power, and more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His future would be greatly affected as a result.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was equivalent to directly lowering his limits and weakening his potential.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If the power can't be released directly, then find a way to store it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne clenched his teeth; he suddenly thought of a way.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The surging power pushed him to the Empyrean Sacredness level, and he could no longer suppress it. Since that was the case, he decided not to suppress it but to choose a container to temporarily store this surging power. Later, when he truly broke through to Empyrean Sacredness, he would reclaim this power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>By then, when he breaks through to primary Empyrean Sacredness and reclaims this power, it might directly make him mid Empyrean Sacredness or even advanced Empyrean Sacredness!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could instantly raise several cultivation levels!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Osborne's eyes lit up, but he quickly encountered another problem.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That is, where should this surging power be stored? What "container" could help him temporarily store this power?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he was still in a state of chaos.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was nothing around him; he couldn't sense Primordial, Drum, Flash, nor his Bloodwrought Bow, Warfare Scythe, or anything else.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The only thing he could feel...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Was a blood-colored lotus!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity had completely merged with Osborne, it could be said that Osborne was the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, and the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was Osborne. Within this Bloodwrought Bow, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was the only thing he could feel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, his perception of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was even clearer here.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his heart, an illusory blood-colored lotus floated gently, its roots embedded in every cell, merging with them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity?!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne murmured, feeling the surging power about to push him through the cultivation level. He had no time to hesitate and acted immediately.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne had no other choice at this moment. The illusory shadow of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity in his heart was his only option. He immediately guided the surging power into his heart, into the shadow of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne succeeded!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The surging power actually entered the shadow of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. The immense energy poured in, seemingly causing some changes to the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, but it was not obvious, almost as if it were just an illusion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately felt that the sensation of an imminent breakthrough had vanished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Osborne breathe a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At least I won't break through immediately! The Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity now holds immense power. After I participate in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel and truly break through to Empyrean Sacredness, I can reclaim this power! By then, I'll have a good chance of directly advancing to mid Empyrean Sacredness!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A smile appeared on Osborne's lips.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought the trouble was resolved, but soon he realized he had celebrated too early. In this state, his power continued to surge, and the sensation of an imminent breakthrough quickly returned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne quickly channeled the power back into the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The power within the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity grew even greater, and Osborne could finally confirm that the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity had changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because the previous Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity had only one stem, one leaf, and one flower.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But at this moment...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It had become one stem and two leaves.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was originally just a shadow, as it had completely merged with Osborne, and its physical form had long since vanished.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, this shadow was slowly solidifying, emitting a crimson glow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn&rsquo;t know whether this was good or bad.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, his power was surging every second, seemingly endless, as if forcing Osborne to ascend to Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn&rsquo;t want to break through, so he could only repeatedly channel the surging power into the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, making it increasingly solid, almost as if it had a physical form.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Time passed quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne himself didn&rsquo;t know how long he had been in seclusion. He had even lost count of how many times he felt on the verge of breaking through to Empyrean Sacredness or how much power he had poured into the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, every time he felt unable to suppress the power, he would channel it into the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under such circumstances, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity transformed rapidly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Until a certain moment, Osborne felt the surrounding chaos fading, and the comfort akin to being in a womb quickly disappeared. His power finally stopped surging.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity in his heart had completely transformed in appearance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It now had three stems, six lotus leaves, and nine lotus flowers!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity was filled with immense power, so overwhelming that even Osborne was astonished. If he were to reclaim this power...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could immediately break through to Empyrean Sacredness, becoming a mid Empyrean Sacredness, or even an advanced Empyrean Sacredness...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Or perhaps, even more?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne wasn't sure. In any case, the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity had completely changed, and Osborne had completely changed as well.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, he suddenly opened his eyes.</span></p><div class="pagination">
