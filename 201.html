  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Draco Group's Class B explosive grenades didn't use traditional cyclonite ammunition but cutting-edge photo particle technology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their power was more than ten times that of cyclonite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These grenades, no bigger than a fist, packed the punch of a large-caliber cannon. The Draco Group strictly limited their sale, so they rarely appeared on the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, three Class B explosive grenades lay among Apollo and his eighteen men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To fend off Osborne's sniping, they used earth walls and water spheres to shield everyone, which also made them stand close to each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blast radius of the three Class B explosive grenades covered them all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of the way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo roared, his eyes bloodshot. He couldn't hold back anymore. A whirlwind, like a tornado, suddenly enveloped him and a few of his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could wrap everyone in the whirlwind, the grenades detonated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The massive explosion instantly shattered the water spheres and walls protecting them. Those closest to the grenades were torn apart instantly. Even though they were mechanical cyborgs, far stronger than ordinary humans, they couldn't withstand the blast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least six men were blown to pieces without even a scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few others who managed to throw themselves to the ground in time were not directly killed but had their backs ripped open, bleeding profusely. The intense shockwave knocked them unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they weren't dead, they were out of the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the seven protected by Apollo's Wind Tornado remained unscathed, though they were a bit dizzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing their dead and injured&nbsp;companions, those who left turned red with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If not for Apollo's quick reaction, they would have been just like the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo bellowed, his voice filled with fury and murderous intent. He couldn't understand. "We were still over 1500 feet from the enemy. How did we get hit by grenades?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who can throw a grenade 1500 feet and accurately through a small hole in the wall?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And without us noticing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo's men were dying or injured. The thirty-man Viper Squad was now reduced to eight. Apollo's heart ached.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were blood red, roaring nonstop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne heard Apollo's shrill and furious roar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was satisfied. Of course, he couldn't throw grenades 1500 feet away and accurately place them at Apollo's feet without being noticed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used ocular energy to secretly place the grenades on Apollo's way. When Apollo's group got closer, he used ocular energy again to pull the pins and accurately throw them into the small holes in the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo was clueless about Osborne's abilities and left to react passively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most importantly, Osborne had the Draco Group's Class B single-soldier equipment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The formidable power of the Class B single-soldier equipment was the fundamental reason for such a spectacular victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's time to move," Osborne muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Apollo was thoroughly enraged. Weapons wouldn't work anymore, and he had to face Apollo head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's target, the two metahumans, were now severely injured. As long as Valentin could temporarily hold off Apollo, Osborne would have the time to absorb the elemental essence of the two, enhancing his own power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne ordered Valentin over the earpiece. "Valentin, it's time. Stay safe, and watch out for Apollo's last-ditch efforts. Buy me five minutes, and I'll take care of Apollo myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin was stunned. From afar, he had watched Osborne single-handedly, with just a gun and a few grenades, decimate Apollo's elite squad from over a thousand feet away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin reflected that he himself couldn't do that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Osborne's command, his eyes lit up, his expression turning stern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, listen up. Snipers keep your high ground and provide support at any moment. The rest, follow me and charge." With that, Valentin led the charge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo soon spotted Valentin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the nearly three times their number, Apollo wasn't scared. Instead, his eyes gleamed with ferocity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn you, Valentin, I'll wipe you all out. Kill them!" With that, Apollo charged towards Valentin, his body surrounded by a terrifying tornado. Anything in his path, when it hit the tornado, was shredded to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin's expression was grave, but he didn't retreat. He had to buy time for Osborne. He took a deep breath. "Fight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The real battle began.</span></p><div class="pagination">
