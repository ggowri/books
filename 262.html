  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Blake's shout, the surroundings erupted into chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many guests on the first floor, having heard the commotion from the second floor, followed Wesley up to check, including several heads of wealthy families and their heirs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all allies of the Ashford family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Blake's loud accusations, their expressions darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you commit such despicable acts at Mr. Ashford's wedding."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Ashford, do not let him off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today is your wedding. If you do not want to handle this, leave it to me. I guarantee I will make him disappear cleanly, so he would not harm anyone else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley waved his hand to signal everyone to be quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed his cold gaze on Osborne and said, "Osborne, I welcome you to my wedding, but you committed such outrage at my wedding. Are you trying to ruin it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I do not deal with you, how can I continue to show my face?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, kneel down immediately!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, do not blame me for being ruthless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Wesley finished speaking, his bodyguards all drew their pistols, aiming coldly at Osborne's head. They were ready to shoot Osborne full of holes the moment Wesley gave the order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Wesley wore a confident expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today was his wedding with Ophelia. To ensure her safety, aside from the security personnel at Rose Castle, only Ashford and Caldwell families' bodyguards were allowed to carry guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Other guests had to go through security checks and were prohibited from bringing guns inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a dozen guns pointed at Osborne's head, Wesley did not believe Osborne could turn the situation around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he knew Osborne was powerful, he doubted he could withstand a dozen guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furthermore, Wesley could call in more bodyguards at any time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how strong Osborne was, he was doomed today!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley's face was smug as he looked disdainfully at Osborne. "Osborne, kneel down quickly! After causing such a scene, I will deal with you slowly after the wedding and give all the guests an explanation!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's lips curled into a smile as he looked at Wesley calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with a dozen guns pointed at his head, he showed no signs of panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wesley, quite a method."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley was pleased with himself and pretended ignorance. "What method? I do not know what you are talking about! All I see is you attacking my guests at my wedding and attempting to assault and rape Ava!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone saw it; do you have any more excuses?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished, the crowd nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That is right, we all saw it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kneel down immediately, or even if we have to kill you, no one will speak up for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kneel down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As their shouting continued, more people came upstairs to check, inquiring about the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon learning that Osborne had tried to assault and rape Ava, and after attacking Blake and getting caught in the act by Wesley, they were all enraged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked at Osborne with disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph, such things happened in broad daylight, truly reckless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Ashford, do not let him off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, he definitely should not be spared!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the bride, Ophelia, came up. After learning the situation, her gaze towards Osborne turned extremely cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She did not know it was Wesley's scheme or the connection between the Scarlet Gang and the Ashford family, so she snorted coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you are such a disappointment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I originally thought you were just useless and a bit of a loser who flattered women for a living. I did not expect you to be such a scum!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you that desperate for women? Did you come to my wedding to assault and rape innocent women just to ruin my wedding and make me a laughingstock?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are truly disgraceful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's words sparked numerous agreements and condemnations from the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained calm and composed, showing no signs of anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the accusations subsided, he said calmly, "Have any of you investigated before accusing me? Are you sure what you heard is the truth and not a setup?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph, do not even think about making excuses!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley said sternly, "Osborne, everyone is not stupid. Many of us saw you standing on Blake's head, trying to kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think lying will help you? Ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished, the crowd nodded in agreement, turning their condemnation back to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Ashford, stop wasting time with him. Quickly capture him. The wedding time is approaching, and we cannot let him delay it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deal with him after the wedding!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Killing him would not be too much!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley nodded and ordered, "Catch this bastard! If he resists, shoot him and kill him immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguards complied with the order, grinning as they surrounded Osborne, their guns still aimed at his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Submit immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or we will open fire!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
