  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clock struck midnight, casting the quiet canyon into deep darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only faint moonlight trickled through the canopy, making it hard for the team to navigate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite their lighting equipment, progress was slow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both canyon entrances were three miles from the central flag, so the team with the fastest pace could seize it first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, escaping with the flag meant passing through the enemy's blockade, so being the first to grab it wasn't the main priority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin decided against a mad dash and instead kept the team moving in a tight formation to avoid attacks from the canyon's deadly creatures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With high-profile spectators watching, it would be humiliating to suffer casualties before the real battle began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and Isa lingered at the back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How's Zoe doing?" Osborne asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe had been apprenticing under Isa, and Osborne was eager to hear about her progress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled, satisfaction written on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's incredibly talented. Calling her a genius doesn't do her justice. She's a prodigy. She learns astonishingly fast. Anything I teach her, she grasps immediately and even innovates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Her mental power has soared. In just two days, she's advanced from Class F to Class E, and she's still progressing rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's very dedicated, eager to enhance her abilities to support you. At this rate, she'll soon be a C-class psychic, capable of providing real assistance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was thrilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're an excellent teacher."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa glanced at him, smiling playfully. "So, how do you plan to thank me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes. "I was just being polite. She's your apprentice. Why should I thank you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But don't you see her as a sister? Since I've taught her so well, shouldn't you thank me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed, defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want as thanks?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's smile widened. "I'll let you know later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then continued to move gracefully through the thorny forest, casually observing their surroundings as if she were out for a stroll rather than heading into battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin, in contrast, was deeply serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After advancing 1.8 miles, he ordered the team to switch off their lights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're nearing the central area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apollo's team is likely faster than us. Their weapons and gear are just as advanced, and they have elite snipers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, everyone stay hidden, keep silent, find good cover, and get ready for a fight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Our strategy is defense!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lyra, take the snipers and find high ground to set up positions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Talon, lead the scouts and spread out. Monitor the canyon for any movement. We can't let them sneak past us with the flag!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Astra, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin kept barking out commands, and the elite forces of Skyefall Security sprang into action with remarkable speed and silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only ten people remained in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These ten, excluding Osborne and Isa, were all senior members of Skyefall Security, each possessing Class C strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them were three metahuman and four martial artists, ready to form the assault team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin's plan was simple. They would let Apollo's team grab the flag first while he and his team scouted for better positions and set up their defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The key was to stop Apollo from escaping with the flag and secure victory through solid defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne found the plan solid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of Skyefall Security's personnel were seasoned bodyguards, skilled in defense rather than offense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their best chance was to use their defensive strength to make up for the gap in combat power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, defense alone wouldn't be enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a flag-capturing battle, and the main objective was to seize the flag. That was why Valentin had assembled his top ten into an assault team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they found the flag, the assault team would grab it and make a quick exit from the canyon to win the game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The plan seemed sound, but whether it would go as smoothly as Valentin hoped was another story.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the battle's intensity grew, Osborne sharpened his focus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He activated his Satan's Eye, gaining night vision and x-ray capabilities, which provided them with a critical edge in the pitch-black night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne soon located Apollo's team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected, they had already reached the center of the canyon and taken the flag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead of rushing out, they seemed to be biding their time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo understood that Valentin would likely have fortified positions to block their escape, making a hasty exit potentially disastrous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo sneered, eyes fixed on the direction of Skyefall Security. "Valentin, since you dared to cross me, you'll regret it. Today, I'm not just going to win. I'll wipe you all out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then began issuing orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Viper Team One, track down and eliminate Skyefall Security's scouts. I want every last one of them dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Make sure they can't see a thing!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
