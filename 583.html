  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, come out!</span><span> </span><span>When did you get here? How dare you hide and spook me with your stories?</span><span> </span><span>Come out now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne yelled loudly</span><span>. He was</span><span> certain that Isa </span><span>came back</span><span>. She </span><span>must be</span><span> hiding in the shadows, disguised as an old person, telling mythological stories just to tease him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa had once told him stories, claiming she was God of Night at the Court of the Sun, and jokingly said that she had vanquished the gods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the time, Osborne joked back, saying if Isa was the God of Night, then he must be God of Beauty, but Isa corrected him seriously, telling him he was actually God of Death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, these titles resurfaced, leading Osborne right back to Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isa, come out. Stop teasing me.</span><span> </span><span>I miss you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shouted, unable to hear his own voice but believing Isa could.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, there was no response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, the elderly man continued, "Isa? Do you know about the Court of the Sun because of this Isa? Who exactly is she?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why does she know about the age of gods? Why does she know about the Court of the Sun?</span><span> </span><span>There are others besides me who know about the age of gods in this world?</span><span> </span><span>Where is she?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man's voice was excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted coldly. "Isa, are you still playing</span><span> your little game</span><span>? This isn't fun anymore! Come out now, or wait until I catch you and see what I'll do to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne searched everywhere, calling out loudly, hoping to find Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't know that at this very moment, far away over the ocean, Isa was walking on the waves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"God of Time, where are you?</span><span> </span><span>Why can't I feel your divine power anymore? Who has hidden </span><span>it</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she perked up and listened closely, and then a smile appeared on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why is he calling me?</span><span> Is he in</span><span> trouble?</span><span> </span><span>Let's go </span><span>find out</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Isa vanished from the sea as if she had never been there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in the dark dungeons of the Augustine family, Isa's figure slowly appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a divine tomb!</span><span> </span><span>There's an evil god about to awaken, and a guardian of the divine tomb is still alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa murmured, first glancing at Osborne but not approaching him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were fixed on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa spoke softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, a translucent shadow appeared before Isa, resembling an elderly man but clearly just a soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Isa, his face filled with shock and fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you? Why..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled lightly. "Didn't you just mention me? You don't know who I am? But that's right. You probably never had the chance to meet me in the age of gods."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am Night!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Isa spoke, the old man froze, and then his body shook violently as he knelt before her, prostrating himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am your subordinate, God of Star, greets Ms. Night!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Night, I had no idea you were still alive! It's good to see you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa waved her hand. "</span><span>Please s</span><span>tand up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are God of Star? </span><span>Most of</span><span> the gods are dead, and you're still alive, though just as a soul. Unfortunately, I can't help you reshape your divine body yet since my power hasn't been restored. You'll have to wait a bit longer.</span><span>"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Star, his eyes filled with excitement, trembled as he spoke, "Ms. Night, I dare not ask you to waste divine power on reshaping my body for me. Just knowing you are still alive is enough for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled faintly. "I'm not just helping you reshape your body for nothing. See that young man there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Star looked at Osborne and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Night, does he have something to do with you? Did you tell him about the Court of the Sun?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded. "He is my man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Star was stunned, his face filled with disbelief and shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa remained calm. "He's still too weak now, and I don't have much time left. Since you're God of Star and only a soul remains, I need to borrow your light elemental essence to help him improve. You don't mind</span><span> it</span><span>, do you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Star stiffened and then quickly nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's an honor to help you, Ms. Night, but my light elemental essence is the divine essence, and his body might not withstand it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa smiled lightly. "Don't worry. I'll seal your light elemental essence to let him slowly unlock it! Besides, he might not choose to focus on your light elemental in the end. We're just trying it out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Isa reached out her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, a faint light was extracted from the soul of God of Star.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can go now. Protect yourself. When my power returns, I will come to slay the evil god here and help you reshape your divine body."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Star bowed deeply in gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Ms. Night!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, God of Star disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa then turned to Osborne in the dungeon with a gentle smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne was still loudly calling out for </span><span>her</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Isa, stop fooling me. Come out now! I'm getting mad!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
