  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nebula City, the largest city in the Glorious Divine Kingdom, is incredibly prosperous and bustling.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All the First-rate Powers of the Glorious Divine Kingdom have bases in Nebula City. Even some forces of the Evernight Court have bases in Nebula City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fairy Moon Sect also has a base in Nebula City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne walked out of Nebula City's Cosmic Translocator and immediately contacted Angela, but unfortunately, Angela was still at Fairy Moon Sect and would take some time to arrive in Nebula City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Angela asked Osborne to go to Fairy Moon Sect's base and stay there temporarily, but Osborne refused.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time coming to Nebula City, he planned to start his revenge. Staying at Fairy Moon Sect's base now could easily implicate Fairy Moon Sect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Besides, he was very familiar with Nebula City, so finding a place to stay was easy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nebula City is divided into the Palace, the Inner City, and the Outer City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For ordinary people, the Palace is a forbidden area, the residence of the Glorious Divine Kingdom's Royal Family. Even members of the Royal Family's branch bloodline or high-ranking generals and officials of the Glorious Divine Kingdom can only enter when summoned.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Inner City is mostly inhabited by members of the Royal Family's branch bloodline, various officials, high-ranking generals, wealthy merchants, and warriors from major forces.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was originally a disciple of Mystic Sirius Sect and could only live in the Outer City of Nebula City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he stood out in the zone duel and became the champion of Eastern Zone 3, so as long as he presented the Kingdom Duel Badge, he could enter the Inner City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne hesitated and chose not to do so.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once he presented the Kingdom Duel Badge, many people would likely know he had arrived in Nebula City, and the over 46 billion Kingdom Duel Scorepoints on his badge would be exposed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nebula City is not absolutely safe either.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once his identity and wealth are exposed, there's no guarantee someone won't take the risk to target him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, before the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel begins, he needs to hide his strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he also doesn't want to live in the Outer City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Outer City is more chaotic, and he can hardly see his enemies there. Osborne wants to enter the Inner City. Once inside the Inner City, with his Satan's Eye, he can even observe the situation inside the Palace, and perhaps even...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He can see the situation inside the Royal Sepulcher!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Luckily, I know a way to enter the Inner City!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne arrived at a hotel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying a few words to the hotel staff, Osborne was taken to a private room. Shortly after, a hotel manager appeared.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You want to enter the Inner City?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man got straight to the point and said, his eyes boldly sizing up Osborne. However, Osborne had the Sublime Concealment Orb, which altered his appearance and aura, so he wasn't worried about being recognized.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said calmly, "I heard you have a way to get people into the Inner City, so I came."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man didn't notice anything and nodded, saying, "First, tell me your identity! The Glorious Divine Kingdom's once-in-a-decade sacrificial ceremony is approaching, and right now, the Glorious Divine Kingdom has very strict defenses around Nebula City. It's extremely difficult for anyone without a proper identity to enter the Inner City."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you're a spy from the Evernight Court or looking for a chance to disrupt the sacrificial ceremony, sending you in would be trouble if discovered."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne heard this and smiled faintly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm not a spy from the Evernight Court! Although I can't reveal my true identity, I can tell you who referred me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man raised an eyebrow. "Who?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Vidar!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne spoke, and the man immediately widened his eyes and abruptly stood up. "Vidar? Are you really someone referred by Vidar? Hasn't Vidar been missing for over a thousand years? Is he still alive?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes flickered with a trace of sadness upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vidar Elrod was once his friend. He was an ordinary man living at the bottom of Nebula City. Osborne, as a prince, was constantly targeted, humiliated, and beaten in the Palace, so he often secretly left the Palace to the Outer City to clear his mind.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In such circumstances, he met Vidar and a group of others, becoming good friends with them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Spending time with ordinary people like Vidar, Osborne felt more at ease.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But later, Michelle was executed, and he was banished from the Palace, exiled from Nebula City, and even expelled from the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted to leave, but a group of mysterious people was hunting him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the critical moment, Vidar and a group of friends saved Osborne and protected him as he fled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, Osborne used a one-way Cosmic Translocator to leave the Racial Convergence Planet, escaping the pursuit, but Vidar and the group of friends died.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They sacrificed their lives to save Osborne!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Vidar, the nephew of this hotel's owner, was the one who told Osborne that his family had special channels to get people into the Inner City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Vidar often went into the Inner City to hang out because of this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of Vidar and the friends from his past life, Osborne clenched his fists and stared at the person opposite him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He spoke, "Sir, you don't need to test me! Vidar didn't go missing; he died! He died in the Mountain Ridgy east of Nebula City! Along with him, his group of friends also died...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I am also Vidar's friend!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I will avenge him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne finished firmly, and the expression of the person opposite him instantly changed, becoming much softer.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Looks like you really are Vidar's friend!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I won't question your identity. Just because you said you'll avenge Vidar, I believe you! Let's go, I'll take you into the Inner City now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne breathed a sigh of relief upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The man trembled and said, "I should be the one thanking you! After Vidar's death, no one dared to avenge him, not even dared to speak about it, let alone investigate! Even I was consumed by fear!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You are the first person to say you'll avenge him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't know if you'll succeed, but I hope you do! This is the Inner City's token. With this token, you won't have to worry about being investigated!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying that, the man handed Osborne a token.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was once again grateful. With this token, he now had an official identity in the Inner City and no longer needed to hide from patrols.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the man led Osborne to a mirror.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Step into this mirror, and you'll come out from the same kind of mirror on the other side of the Inner City! This is my special power, not very useful... I used to send Vidar and the others into the Inner City like this, and we were never discovered."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This mirror hasn't been used since Vidar's death! So, when you came to me, I knew you must be connected to Vidar..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now, go in!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wish you all the best! If you encounter danger, just escape through the mirror on the other side!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded firmly upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I understand, thank you!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Osborne walked towards the mirror without hesitation. The seemingly solid mirror transformed into a soft, water-like surface at that moment, and Osborne stepped in effortlessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, he emerged from another identical mirror.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, he had already arrived in the Inner City.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I finally made it in!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne murmured and walked out of the room where the mirror was kept. He found himself in a secluded, narrow alley, and after leaving the alley, he merged into the crowd.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "I need to first find a hotel where I can observe the Palace and Royal Sepulcher to settle down!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Osborne was thinking, he noticed a hotel ahead surrounded by a bustling crowd.</span></p><div class="pagination">
