  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox glanced at Austin, a flicker of admiration in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled and said, "Life power, huh? Not many can cultivate it to your level in Racial Convergence Planet! We at Mystic Sirius Sect could definitely use someone like you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to give you all another chance&mdash;surrender and come with me to the Mystic Sirius Sect. I might be able to persuade Zayne to provide your Human Community on Celestara Planet a chance to survive, maybe even spare you from annihilation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, I'll have to drag you back myself, and you won't be able to resist! The only outcome for the Human Community on Celestara Planet will be extinction!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished speaking, Austin snorted dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're really annoying! Who do you think you are, demanding others to surrender like that? What gives you the confidence to act so superior? If I were you, I'd start thinking about how to surrender myself! If you keep this up, we might just storm the Mystic Sirius Sect and eliminate everyone connected to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a frustrated wave of her hand, Austin made her feelings clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox let out a cold snort. "Hmph! What a fool! I've given you a chance; it's your own fault for not appreciating it! Since you've chosen this path, I won't waste my breath any longer. If you refuse to give in, I'll just beat you until you do!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm eager to see how many times your life power can save them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Maddox struck again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His seemingly casual attack was anything but weak, and Emma and Clarissa paled at the sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They quickly joined forces, pouring every ounce of energy they had into their defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying lightning hand descended again, crashing through their defenses like paper and sending them flying once more, blood spurting from their mouths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin clenched her teeth, hurriedly channeling life energy to heal them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, another massive lightning hand came crashing down towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mind your own business!" Maddox's icy voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin's expression hardened instantaneously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't spare a moment to heal Clarissa and Emma. Austin quickly dodged. Realizing she couldn't escape, she cast a layer of green energy to shield herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The enormous lightning hand shattered her barrier and slammed into her, causing her body to explode like a wooden stake splintering into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was Austin dead?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course not!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox raised an eyebrow in surprise. "A Substitute Doll? Impressive! You've mastered that technique? Trying to kill you won't be easy, huh? But I wonder how many times your little trick can serve you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox's gaze shifted to another direction, where Austin's figure emerged slowly, completely unscathed and even restoring Emma and Clarissa's wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, her expression was grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox was too strong! Any casual attack could kill her. She had to use Substitute Doll just to dodge his blows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, relying on the doll consumed a tremendous amount of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Clarissa and Emma. "Clarissa, Emma, what should we do next?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa and Emma shook their heads, their faces tight with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap in cultivation levels was far too great; they had no good options. Unless they could break through to Ascension Eight, facing Maddox seemed impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While their talent was undoubtedly top-tier, indeed the best on Celestara Planet, Maddox was no slouch either. As the seventh-ranked inner disciple of Mystic Sirius Sect, he was a genius among geniuses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And coupled with his Ascension Nine cultivation level? Even united, the three of them weren't a match for him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battlefield fell into an eerie silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The members of the Human Alliance watched, faces etched with anxiety and dread. The Goddesses of Fate and Life, along with the God of Death, all their combined strength still couldn't stand against Maddox!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was terrifying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every warrior of the Human Community felt a creeping sense of despair wash over them, realizing the stark reality of their situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had once believed that the return of the God of Time, the Goddess of Fate, the God of Death, and the Goddess of Life would bring hope. Just like a thousand years ago, they thought they could defeat Lord Malevolence and seal him away, ensuring victory for the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with Lord Malevolence yet to make an appearance, they were faced with a powerful ally of his, and that realization filled each of them with despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa and the others felt the weight of the Human Alliance's hopelessness pressing down on them, but they were at a loss for what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox sneered and said, "What's this? Are you all ready to give up? Too bad! I've already given you a chance. You didn't appreciate it, and now that you want to surrender, it's too late! You'll just have to accept your fate as my captives!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa gritted her teeth. "Who said we're giving up? Don't think you've already won! The outcome is still undecided&mdash;bring it on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she launched another attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma and Austin quickly followed suit, unleashing everything they had against Maddox.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maddox merely scoffed at their efforts. "You're truly clueless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his hand, he retaliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle raged on, a tempest of terrifying power erupting around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The landscape for miles&mdash;tens of thousands of miles&mdash;crumbled under the intensity of their clash, everything fading into nothingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their combined strength was monstrous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both the Human Alliance and the Dark Deity Legion dared not approach, retreating further and further to avoid being caught in the crossfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were forced to manage the battle's range, as unleashing their full power could easily devastate millions of miles, even tens of millions, leaving nothing but desolation in its wake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa, Emma, and Austin were once again sent reeling by Maddox's assault, blood spilling from their lips, their faces pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were giving it their all, but it was clear&mdash;they were no match for Maddox.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was every bit as formidable as Lord Malevolence had been a millennium ago. Even their combined strength couldn't bring him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that was considering Maddox hadn't even resorted to using any Apex divine </span><span>artifacts yet; he was simply toying with them, aiming to capture them alive for the Mystic Sirius Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had wanted to, they would have been defeated long ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Maddox was starting to grow impatient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As an Ascension Nine Supernal Deity King, facing off against three Ascension Seven Supernal Deity Kings and not wrapping this up quickly was getting on his nerves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't waste any more time with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a massive, crackling metal hammer appeared in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Hammer of Thor?!" Anastasia gasped as she recognized the weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It looked strikingly similar to her own Hammer </span><span>of Thor, only this one radiated an even more terrifying power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a top-tier Apex divine artifact!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, face your defeat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a mighty swing of the Hammer of Thor, Maddox unleashed a torrent of lightning that surged into the weapon, amplifying its already formidable energy. The storm of electricity shot toward Clarissa and the others with lethal intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three felt the overwhelming force of the lightning, and their faces paled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">We can't stop this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, Isa sprang into action, positioning herself protectively in front of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression remained calm as she reached out, grasping the terrifying lightning with her bare hands.</span></p><div class="pagination">
