  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Zoe chimed in, "Anastasia, come on, stop being so modest!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your talent is downright extraordinary</span><span>. I</span><span>t's the kind of talent that makes me envious! But you really don't need to compare yourself to Osborne. He's on a whole different level!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze held a hint of envy as she looked at Anastasia. Despite being identical twins, there was a significant gap in their abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's brilliance overshadowed Zoe's own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia quickly replied, "Zoe, you're amazing too, you know!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're at the peak of Deity Overlord now! Back when you were a Junior Deity, you had a Level Five Divine Body, and now you've reached the pinnacle of Level Six. Just a little more time, and you'll definitely hit Level Seven!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once you break through to Deity King, your Divine Body will transform again, and you might even achieve a Level Eight Galactic Divine Body! You're a prodigy in your own right!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And your soul power attacks? They're tough for even me to handle! One slip, and I could easily get trapped in your illusions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Anastasia finished speaking, Zoe's cheeks flushed pink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew she could be considered a prodigy, but with Osborne and Anastasia shining so brightly, she felt somewhat "ordinary" in comparison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, Zoe's talent was among the very best in Celestara!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the top seven Deity Kings of the Human Community would be hard-pressed to match her innate abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, how could Isa have chosen her as a disciple?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Isa had only taught Zoe for a short time, if Zoe didn't have the talent, Isa wouldn't have poured so much effort into her training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, Anastasia was indeed a prodigy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not just her, but also Osborne's grandfather Sebastian, along with Bryce, Kendra, and Mila</span><span>, </span><span>they all belonged to the ranks of exceptional talents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had all forged Level Five Divine Bodies while still Junior Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although, aside from Mila, the others had used Phoenix Ascension when they broke through to enhance their Divine Bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, regardless of their other attributes, their Divine Bodies are undeniably formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly had a thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Logically, when breaking through to Superior Deity or Transcendent Deity, a Divine Body should undergo a transformation, typically increasing by one level. Yet, when Anastasia, Zoe, Grandpa, Bryce, and Kendra experienced their second transformation, their Divine Bodies didn't improve as expected!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be because they used Phoenix Ascension? Perhaps it elevated their Divine Bodies to a high level right from the start, but now they're struggling to advance further?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mila didn't use Phoenix Ascension. She had a Level Five Divine Body as a Junior Deity, and now that she's reached Deity Overlord, her Divine Body has successfully transformed to Level Seven!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Grandpa, Zoe, Bryce, and Kendra, who all used Phoenix Ascension, are still stuck at the peak of Level Six! It seems to be a direct result of Phoenix Ascension! If it weren't for that, they'd all be ready to break through to Deity King by now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned as he pondered this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It looks like Mila's innate talent is the highest among them all! Grandpa and the others seem to have relied on Phoenix Ascension to force their way up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that's not too big of a deal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celestial Crystals can enhance their potential, and they'll catch up eventually!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne felt a wave of relief wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Phoenix Ascension was a powerful technique taught to him by Isa, and he had no doubts about its efficacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, can I stay by your side and fight alongside you all?" Zoe asked, biting her lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hesitated for a moment, but then a smile broke across his face as he nodded. "I was just worried about your safety, which is why I wanted you to stay in Hope Haven to cultivate peacefully. But if you're feeling restless, then sure, you can join us outside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zoe's face lit up with joy at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Bryce finished his training and approached with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, can I join you out there too? I've been cooped up here for over twenty years, and I'm itching to spar with those super geniuses from the other races. I want them to see the strength of the Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind him stood his sister, Kendra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like Zoe, Bryce and Kendra were at the peak of Deity Overlord, boasting Level Six Divine Bodies and elemental essence also at Level Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't rushed to break through to Deity King yet, wanting to wait until their Divine Bodies reached Level Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their strength was comparable to Zoe's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bryce, Kendra, you both want to step outside too? Getting restless, are we?" Osborne teased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bryce nodded, still grinning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, we won't hold you back! Sure, we might not be on the same level as someone like you or even Anastasia and Mila, but I think we're pretty solid. And Kendra? She's definitely stronger than I am!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, Kendra's cheeks flushed with a hint of embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, another voice chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I want to stay outside, too, and I want to be by your side."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Mila!</span></p><div class="pagination">
