  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level Five space elemental essence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Osborne had anticipated, his space elemental essence soared to Level Five in a short span after devouring the core energy of a Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And remarkably, it had only consumed thirty percent of that vast energy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pace of its advancement slowed down upon reaching Level Five, but it continued to steadily absorb the remaining energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a matter of days, it would undoubtedly consume the entirety of the Primordial Crimson Lotus' core, pushing it to the peak of Level Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it could breach Level Six remained uncertain, but Osborne wasn't fazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still had seven more cores of Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity at his disposal!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "God of Star once told me that the Realm is divided into six levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only gods can master Level Five Realm, and she herself only possessed Level Five Light Realm. Typically, it requires at least a Superior Deity, or even a Transcendent Deity, to grasp the peak of Level Five Realm. As for Level Six Realm, that's the </span><span>domain of Celestial Deities and Deity Overlords!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Deity Kings...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps Level Six Realm isn't the ultimate limit... There might be a Level Seven Realm that exists beyond it. God of Star just didn't know because she hadn't reached that level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I dare not even dream of Level Seven Realm yet, but Level Six Realm is my destination. With seven cores of Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, elevating both my space and dark elemental essences to Level Six, or even the peak of Level Six, should be effortless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This realization filled Osborne with immense excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his space and dark elemental essences both reached Level Six, his power would skyrocket to a level normally only attainable by Celestial Deities or even Deity Overlords!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a new influx of information appeared in Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Space Collapse? Phantom Steps?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was pleasantly surprised. As expected, breaking through to Level Five in space elemental essence had granted him two new spatial power techniques&mdash;Space Collapse and Phantom Steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, I already know Space Collapse!" he mused, initially disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as Osborne quickly absorbed the new information, his disappointment turned to elation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the true Space Collapse?! The version I knew before was incomplete and flawed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This new one is not only more powerful but also faster to activate and has a wider range of collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With my current strength, I can collapse a space of up to three miles in radius! Enough to completely obliterate a small city!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gasped in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Such incredible power! But the energy consumption is still as enormous as ever," he muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, while Space Collapse was devastatingly powerful, it was also notoriously energy-intensive and indiscriminate in its destruction. It couldn't be used lightly, especially not at its full potential, lest it caused unimaginable casualties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In comparison, Abyssal Spiral might be slightly less powerful, but it's more controllable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly mastered the complete version of Space Collapse and then turned his attention to Phantom Steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Phantom Steps allowed one to harness spatial power and enter a parallel space for rapid traversal, rendering them invisible, intangible, and undetectable to those in the main space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is an escape technique! And it can also be used for stealth and ambush attacks. It's far more advanced than the Stealth Arts of the Eityreia Organization. Unless a warrior is significantly stronger than me, they'll never be able to detect me while using Phantom Steps!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was thrilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always desired to master a powerful Stealth Art, and now his wish had finally been granted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Phantom Steps is distinct from interdimensional travel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While interdimensional travel boasted incredible speed, allowing one to traverse hundreds or even thousands of miles in an instant, it was essentially point-to-point teleportation with no journey in between.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would move from one spot to another in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, Phantom Steps might not match that speed, but it offered superior agility and flexibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Interdimensional travel could be intercepted or interrupted easily, but Phantom Steps was immune to such disruptions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fantastic! I'm stronger than ever now!" Osborne mused with satisfaction. In the past, his physical strength was unrivaled, but his elemental power had been a weak spot, contributing little in battles against truly formidable foes. But now, power was no longer his Achilles' heel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling pleased with his progress, he decided to save the remaining seven cores of Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity for future use.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eventually, he was determined to elevate both his space and dark elemental essences to Level Six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once they reach Level Six, maybe even more powerful techniques will emerge!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne carefully stored the remaining seven cores of energy within his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the fusion of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity with his body was nearing completion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lotus' roots were rapidly growing, permeating every nook and cranny of his being, entwining each organ, and penetrating every cell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The promise of immortality was nearly within his grasp!</span></p><div class="pagination">
