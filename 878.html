  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a swift kick, Osborne sent the unconscious Clay flying off the platform, treating him like yesterday's trash.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The audience below was stunned into silence, their expressions a mix of disbelief and horror.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They gaped at Clay's battered body, unable to comprehend how someone who had been so full of bravado could be annihilated by a single blow from Osborne&mdash;even in his own Light Realm.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clay had not only been defeated but had also suffered broken ribs from being stomped on and tossed out of the ring like a piece of refuse.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A collective gasp echoed through the crowd.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those who had felt regret letting Clay take the lead were now feeling a wave of relief.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lucky escape," they thought, realizing that had they pushed ahead, they'd be in Clay's shoes right now.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was painfully clear: they had seriously underestimated Osborne's capabilities.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To take down Clay in one hit was no small feat, and they knew deep down that none of them stood a chance against him.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're dead meat!" Everett's voice cut through the hushed murmurs as he glared at Osborne, his anger palpable.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The murderous intent radiating from him was almost suffocating.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing this, Wesson shot up from his seat, his demeanor shifting as he prepared to confront Everett.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Everett, what's your play here? This is Osborne's Honor Quest Ceremony. You're a Class S Supreme Overlord. You wouldn't dare interfere directly, would you?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everett smirked coldly, saying, "Osborne had the audacity to humiliate my grandson. If I want to teach him a lesson, then I will. You think you can stop me, Wesson?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson's face darkened at the threat.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But before he could respond, Osborne raised a hand, his expression cool and composed. "Mr. Wesson Augustine, don't worry about it. If he dares to make a move, I'm ready."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Casually, Osborne turned to Jackie, the elder presiding over the Honor Quest Ceremony.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Flores, this is my Honor Quest Ceremony. Everett, as a Class S Supreme Overlord, wants to intervene and even lay hands on me. Are you really going to stand by and let that happen?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jackie's expression turned icy as he fixed his gaze on Everett. "Everett, sit down. I don't want to see any more of this nonsense. If it continues, I'll have no choice but to expel you from the arena."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everett's countenance hardened as flickers of caution crossed his eyes.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Swallowing his pride, he merely huffed in response, shooting Osborne a threatening glare before retaking his seat.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jackie announced, his voice firm and authoritative, "Alright, let me make this crystal clear one more time. Besides the challenger, no one is allowed on the platform or to interfere with Osborne's fight. Even Class S Supreme Overlords have no business meddling in this Honor Quest Ceremony! Any violation is a direct affront to the Prophet Alliance, and such disrespect will be dealt with severely!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now, let the Honor Quest Ceremony continue! Who's the next challenger to step up?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Jackie settled back down, a stern look remaining on his face.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne raised an eyebrow, impressed. To himself, he thought, "Everett actually respects Jackie? Is it out of fear for his strength or the backing of the Prophet Alliance?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Either way, he felt relieved that he wouldn't have to worry about any Class S Supreme Overlords crashing his moment in the spotlight.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Turning to the audience, Osborne called out, "So, who else wants to challenge me? Come on up! You all said you wanted to turn my Honor Quest Ceremony into a day of disgrace. Well, if you've got the guts, now's your chance to try and take me down!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A wave of silence washed over the group.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After witnessing Osborne's overwhelming defeat of Clay and seeing the aftermath of broken ribs and humiliation, everyone was reluctant to step forward. They were suddenly acutely aware that their underestimation of Osborne had left them in a precarious position, and hesitation lingered as they contemplated their next move.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before, hundreds had clamored to challenge Osborne, but now, a stark silence blanketed the arena&mdash;no one dared to step up.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, in a surprising turn, one person did make his way to the platform.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was a familiar face: Satoru!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was a member of Ransford's Divine Family, part of the Byrd family, which was also affiliated with the League of Divine Descent.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A cold smile crept onto Osborne's face.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For some reason, Satoru felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He locked eyes with Osborne, his expression grave. "Osborne, I challenge you!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne merely replied, "Then let's get started!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dark Realm!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, a dense shroud of darkness enveloped both Satoru and Osborne. But just one second later, the Dark Realm collapsed like a house of cards.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Satoru coughed up blood, hurtling backward as if shot from a cannon.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He crashed heavily onto the arena floor, a deep imprint of a foot left on his chest, and nearly all of his ribs were shattered.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was clear that he had been sent flying by a single kick from Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In one move, Satoru was defeated, and his defeat was just as brutal as Clay's.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd gasped collectively, shock written all over their faces.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How could this happen?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Didn't they say he was weak? Weren't we promised this Honor Quest Ceremony would become a spectacle of humiliation?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Satoru couldn't even withstand one blow?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne's incredibly strong!"</p><div class="pagination">
