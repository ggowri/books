  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Osborne was cultivating, he fought with Henry and John at Challenge Peak and ultimately defeated them, which was promptly spread amongst the main and branch bloodlines of the Augustine family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's name also appeared in the ears of the Augustine family for the first time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, in the First Mansion at the top of Mount Seven, three tall men were standing in front of the window sill and looking in the direction of the Ninth Estate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is there any detailed information about Osborne? He won't interfere with our plans, will he?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man standing in the center suddenly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He seemed to be about thirty-two or thirty-three years old, with a tall and strong build, looking calm and aloof, not like a Rosmandian but a mixed-blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was the heir, Lance Augustine, who was from the branch bloodline of the Augustine family in Yalynch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The First Mansion was the residence for the branch bloodline of the Augustine family in Yalynch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Among the nine branch bloodlines of the Augustine family, there were some strong and some weak, and the branch bloodline in Yalynch was recognized as the strongest of them all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was followed closely by the branch bloodlines in Marcelin and Ransford.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The reason why Lance could be the heir of the branch bloodline in Yalynch was because he was extremely powerful and unfathomable, far beyond the reach of Henry and John.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many people even compared Lance to Owen and Emma, thinking that he had a great chance of becoming one of the top three the heirs of the main bloodlines of the Augustine family in the near future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even people from the main bloodlines of the Augustine family were respectful when they saw Lance and didn't dare to mess with him easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On Lance's left was a man about his age, who was also a mixed-blood with a much taller build, like an upright grizzly bear, giving a tremendous amount of pressure with his burly body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was the heir, Sam Augustine, from the branch bloodline of the Augustine family in Marcelin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam's power was also extremely strong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The last man looked quite short, only reaching Sam's chest in height, and he looked pretty skinny with a fierce look in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was the heir, David Augustine, from the branch bloodline of the Augustine family in Ransford.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Among the nine branch bloodlines of the Augustine family, six were within Rosmandi, and only three left Rosmandi centuries ago and went abroad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They were branch bloodlines from Yalynch, Marcelin, and Ransford.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps because they were all developing abroad, the three branch bloodlines were very close, forming a team invisibly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam sneered, "Lance, are you scared? Did Osborne make you worry about our plans? If you can't do it, you should just give up your opportunity and get back to Yalynch!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne just defeated Henry and John, and he was nothing at all. Those two were just losers, and there was absolutely no way they could have won in the Branch Bloodline Competition, as they were just along for the ride.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If the three of us join forces, we'll definitely make it out of the Branch Bloodline Competition easily and take up two places as the recognized heir of the Augustine family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">David nodded after Sam finished speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lance, you're too nervous. Our real opponents are Owen and Emma or even Matthew and Vincent from the main bloodlines, and these losers from the branch bloodlines don't deserve our attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When the Branch Bloodline Competition begins, I will defeat them all alone and help you guys get a recognized heir's place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When that time comes, you can't forget the favors you promised to give me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lance smiled faintly upon hearing that, "Don't worry, we won't forget to give you favors. The reason I mention Osborne isn't because I'm worried about him, I just don't want any changes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Branch Bloodline Competition is about to begin, but I didn't realize there was suddenly another branch bloodline and a pretty good opponent, Osborne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I always feel uneasy inside."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam curled his lips. "Lance, you're too nervous! As long as the three of us join forces, even if he is from the main bloodline, who can defeat us? Can Osborne do it? It's ridiculous."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">David nodded. "If you're really worried about it, I'll just find an opportunity to kill him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lance calmly said, "The Augustine family doesn't allow us to fight without permission. If you fight Osborne in private or even kill him, you'll be in big trouble!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">David looked disdainful. "Don't you trust my assassination methods? No one can spot me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lance stared at him and said calmly, "Not even Godfather?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">David was suddenly stunned in place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment, David shrugged. "Well, I'm not going to beat him in private. Anyway, it's not many days until the Branch Bloodline Competition, so I'll fix him then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lance nodded. "Gather his information immediately, and we can't afford to go wrong with something we're confident about. The Branch Bloodline Competition is important to us this time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Got it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the other side, in the Mount Four of the Augustine family, Owen and Evelynn lived in a luxurious manor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, both Owen and Evelynn looked upset.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Henry and John are losers, and they were beaten by Osborne surprisingly easily. It pisses me off. When am I going to kick Osborne's ass?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evelynn said indignantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen said indifferently, "Evelynn, don't be anxious. I told you long ago that Osborne's power wasn't simple, and that people who normally reached Class A+ weren't his match. Unfortunately, Caleb showed up last time. Otherwise, I would have already killed him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evelynn gritted her teeth and said, "Owen, why don't you just go ahead and forcefully challenge him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen shook his head. "No way!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Although I can forcefully challenge him, the most I can do is to violently beat him up and injure him, but I can't kill him. That wouldn't be enough for me to vent my anger."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evelynn looked perplexed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She gritted her teeth and said fiercely, "Owen, you should just assassinate him!"</p><div class="pagination">
