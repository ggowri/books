  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The second-level Satan&rsquo;s Eye already had the ability to see through objects, and as its level increased, this ability became even stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Previously, Osborne could only see through a half-meter-thick concrete wall. Now, he could see clearly through three such walls.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Unfortunately, he could only see, not hear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne saw Paul open a video call. On the screen appeared a middle-aged man with a scar on his face, with a sinister and fierce look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The environment seemed to be a dimly lit underground space.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The two seemed to be discussing something when Paul suddenly changed his expression and took out a strange cross necklace from his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The necklace emitted a faint red glow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Upon seeing the red glow, Paul&rsquo;s face changed, and he immediately ended the call, carefully inspecting the surroundings. Finding nothing, he looked puzzled, then put away the necklace and walked out of the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne also deactivated his Satan&rsquo;s Eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne frowned. This time, the peeking was almost fruitless due to the inability to hear. Paul&rsquo;s behavior seemed strange, but Osborne couldn&rsquo;t pinpoint the problem.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;If only I could hear them. At least I would know who he was talking to. That man is clearly not from the Radcliffe family. Paul locked himself in the room and secretly contacted him. There must be something wrong. And that cross is quite odd.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne thought for a moment, becoming increasingly suspicious of Paul. Unfortunately, he couldn&rsquo;t find any concrete evidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Maybe the Godfather&rsquo;s intelligence system can identify that man.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s eyes lit up. After completing the second heir test, his permissions had increased to two stars, allowing him to use more of the Draco Star Wristlet&rsquo;s functions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The mall now had more items available for purchase, including heavy weaponry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He could even buy intelligence in the mall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne immediately tried it out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He described the man&rsquo;s features and appearance, submitting it to the mall&rsquo;s backend. After spending a million on intelligence fees, the Godfather&rsquo;s intelligence system began matching his description with its database.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon, the photos and information of three most likely matches appeared on Osborne&rsquo;s Draco Star Wristlet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne quickly reviewed them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">[Davy Jones, match rate 90%. Click to view detailed information.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">[Lex Pluto, match rate 50%. Click to view detailed information.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">[Marcus Edwin, match rate 35%. Click to view detailed information.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne quickly scanned through and then focused on Davy&rsquo;s photo. Seeing the scar on his face, Osborne&rsquo;s eyes lit up with joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It really is him.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne clicked on Davy&rsquo;s detailed information, revealing a look of surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Davy Jones, leader of the Maelstrom gang in Mayby City, ran underground fighting arenas, casinos, and was involved in drug trafficking, kidnapping wealthy individuals, and smuggling firearms and vehicles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the leader of an underground gang.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne&rsquo;s expression turned serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In Rosmandi, the Godfather was the undisputed king of the underground world, wielding the greatest influence. However, that didn&rsquo;t mean Rosmandi had no other gangs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">On the contrary, Rosmandi had many underground gangs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wherever there was profit, there were gangs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although the Godfather&rsquo;s power was the strongest, it was impossible to wipe out all other gangs. The Godfather would take the lion&rsquo;s share, but there would always be some leftovers for others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In Mayby City, there were dozens of gangs, with the Maelstrom gang being one of the strongest, engaging in all sorts of illegal activities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;As Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard captain, why would Paul secretly contact the leader of the Maelstrom gang? What was Paul discussing with Davy? Maybe Davy could be my breakthrough!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne made up his mind, planning to find Davy when he had the chance, hoping to uncover some of Paul&rsquo;s secrets from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that moment, Osborne recalled the strange cross Paul had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He immediately uploaded the cross&rsquo; information to the mall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The price for intelligence queries was high, often costing millions, but it was nothing to Osborne now, so he didn&rsquo;t hesitate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This time, it took quite a while for Osborne to receive feedback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">[Cain&rsquo;s Blood Cross, match rate 40%. Click to view detailed information.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">[Ruby jewelry made by the Caldwell Group, Solar Cross, match rate 15%.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;The highest match rate was only 40%? Cain&rsquo;s Blood Cross?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cain was a figure from the Bible, the son of Adam and Eve, whose name meant &ldquo;murderer,&rdquo; and he was considered the ancestor of all evil people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In Rosmandi, Cain was also believed to be the progenitor of vampires.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne hesitated for a moment but decided to click on the detailed information and quickly read through it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, Osborne was stunned.</p><div class="pagination">
