  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne made his move without hesitation. There was no way he'd believe the lies these two were trying to sell. Let them go, and they'd promise the Eityreia Organization wouldn't retaliate? What a joke!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had already killed so many of their Class S assassins, including Sin, the organization's third-in-command. Such losses were devastating even for an organization as massive as Eityreia. There was no chance they'd let Osborne walk away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they would, they wouldn't be the Eityreia Organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They lived by the rule of an eye for an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, if Osborne had already started this fight, he needed to finish it with no loose ends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Osborne killed today, the fewer enemies he'd face tomorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boom!" Osborne unleashed his full power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These two were top-tier Class S assassins, their strength far from ordinary. Together, they were even more troublesome than Sin. Osborne wasn't about to underestimate them, even though he had taken down Sin without much trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fight that followed proved Osborne's caution was well-founded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the two assassins realized negotiations were futile, they fought with all their might. If they didn't, they knew they'd die here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surge of power they unleashed was immense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately for them, their opponent was Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After his breakthrough beyond Class S, Osborne's attack power, defense, and speed had far surpassed that of a regular top-tier Class S warrior. Even though the two assassins were fighting desperately, they couldn't land a decisive blow on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when they managed to crack through Osborne's martial art aura, it wasn't enough to cause serious harm. His body was like it had been forged from pure diamond, impossibly resilient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, despair crept in on the two assassins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And just as Osborne got a full read on their abilities, he finally launched his counterattack. "Medusa's Gaze! Petrify!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne unleashed his petrifying power in an instant. Although it only affected the two assassins by just half a second, that was all he needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seizing the opportunity as one of them froze for that half-second, Osborne swung his Goddess of Grain's scythe and decapitated the assassin, sending blood spraying through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another top-tier Class S warrior had fallen to Osborne's blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his comrade gone, the last remaining top-tier assassin couldn't hold out against Osborne's relentless assault. Soon, he too met his end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just before his death, the assassin roared in fury and despair, "Osborne, the Eityreia Organization will never let you go! You'll face our vengeance! The organization will avenge us! I'll be waiting for you in hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Swoosh!" His head flew into the air, blood spraying one last time before everything fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, "I'll be waiting for Eityreia Organization's revenge." Then, he immediately absorbed the blood energy from the two fallen assassins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Cross within Osborne pulsed with power, now saturated with the blood energy of nearly a hundred Class S assassins from the Eityreia Organization, including three top-tier warriors and more than a dozen veteran Class S fighters. They had left behind not only a collection of divine artifacts but also an immense reservoir of blood energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy within Osborne's Blood Cross was now so dense that if he concentrated it into blood essence, he could help three or four hundred members of Blood Demon break through to Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now was not the time to allow Blood Demon to evolve because the battle wasn't over yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from the assassins of the Eityreia Organization, there were still nearly a hundred warriors from the League of Divine Descent and over three hundred Class S clones from the Aberrants to deal with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blood Demon, hear my command! Follow me and crush our enemies!" Osborne's voice boomed, and all 4,800 Blood Demon members immediately sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the assassins from the Eityreia Organization eliminated, there was no longer any need to protect the Augustine family. Now, they only had one task, follow Osborne and wipe out the warriors from the League of Divine Descent and the Aberrants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the combined forces of League of Divine Descent and the Aberrants totaled over 400 Class S warriors, a terrifyingly strong army, there wasn't a shred of fear among the Blood Demon members. Instead, they were filled with unwavering confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their eyes were fixed on Osborne at the front of the charge, filled with admiration and trust. They believed that victory would be theirs if they followed him, no matter how many enemies stood in their way, no matter how powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!" The 4,800 Blood Demon members roared in unison, their battle cries shaking the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the League of Divine Descent warriors were gripped with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were stunned that the entire force of Eityreia Organization assassins had been wiped out, and even Sin and the two top-tier Class S fighters had been slain by Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They gasped in disbelief and were about to retreat when they realized Osborne had already cut off their escape route.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what are you trying to do?" Everett shouted, "We didn't attack the Augustine family! It was all the Eityreia Organization's doing! The League of Divine Descent doesn't want to become enemies of the Augustine family. We'll leave now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered at Everett's plea, "Don't want to make enemies of the Augustine family? Is that why you allied with the Aberrants to attack them? You want to leave? Sorry, I don't allow it!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
