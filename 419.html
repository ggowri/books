  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Chris heard Bruce's words, his eyes suddenly lit up, and he stared at Osborne intently. Sure enough, he saw five tiny stars in Osborne's left eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is Satan's Eye!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris was very excited. "I didn't expect to meet Godfather's descendant here. If I kill him, Godfather will be heartbroken."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he walked towards Osborne with a sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena's face looked grim, and her sword flashed wildly, trying to attack Chris and stop him from getting close to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Bruce used his cane to completely block Serena's sword light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serena's strength was only slightly stronger than Bruce's. She had been attacked twice by Chris with the Death Sickle before, and her spirit and soul had been damaged. Her strength was no longer at its peak, so it was easier for Bruce to deal with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this scene, Serena looked even more anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She attacked frantically, wanting to get rid of Bruce as quickly as possible and then help Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Bruce was very smart. He didn't fight her but just held on to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris smiled more happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Hernandez, why are you so excited? Is Osborne really Godfather's family? Hahaha, I didn't expect that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I don't want to kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will capture him alive and take him to the King of the Aberrants. I believe that the king will be very interested in Godfather's family members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps he will be transformed into a perfect fighting machine by the king, and soon, he will personally deal with Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The scene will be very exciting then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Chris was speaking, he walked closer to Osborne. His face was full of excitement, and he looked at Osborne with excited but not serious eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, he didn't take Osborne seriously at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's power level was only Class B+, and his soul of powers hadn't transformed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris wasn't afraid of Osborne at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to capture me alive and transform me into a fighting machine to fight Godfather?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at Chris seriously, and there was no fear or retreat in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since there was no way to escape, he would fight with Chris.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Osborne knew that he had no hope of winning against Chris, who could injure Serena, he would rather die in battle than surrender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said, "Let's fight!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to capture me alive? Impossible. What you'll get is my corpse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Osborne took the initiative to attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing a strong man like Chris, he didn't hide anything and instantly transformed into Vampire. His long blood-red hair grew to one hundred yards in length and stabbed towards Chris.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris couldn't help but sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shape-shifting power? A vampire? It's just a low-level power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He swung the huge black sickle in his hand again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, it was no longer a psychic attack. Instead, he slashed toward Osborne's blood-red hair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, all the blood-red hair that Osborne stabbed at Chris was cut off, and a sharp pain spread to Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time his long blood-red hair was cut off after he transformed into Vampire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It hurt so much when his hair was cut off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne gritted his teeth, blue Devil's Light burst out from his body, and he punched Chris hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was his most powerful punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used the Spiral Force taught by Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this scene, Chris was surprised again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't expect that you practiced both martial art and power. Your martial art level has reached Class A martial master, which is higher than your power level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, you are still weak in front of me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris swung the Death Sickle again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's fist hit the Death Sickle, and he felt as if he had hit a piece of thick steel. His fist started bleeding, and the force rebounded back, causing him to cough up blood from the corner of his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris stood there steadily, looking at him with a sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't Chris a psychic metahuman? When he fought with Serena, he didn't dare to take Serena's attack at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought that Chris' body was weak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Osborne knew that he was wrong. Chris' body was weak only to Serena. Compared with him, Chris' body was stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not just power!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chris sneered, "I'm not going to play with you anymore. Just surrender. I said I would capture you alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In front of me, even if you want to die, you can't do that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Death Sickle in Chris' hand began to vibrate wildly. With every vibration, Osborne could feel a terrible force entering his body and his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a moment, Osborne felt that he couldn't move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was his body unable to move, but even his spirit and thinking were suppressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is the gap so big?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the end, I still lost."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clenching his teeth, Osborne could only watch Chris reach out to grab his shoulder.</span></p><div class="pagination">
