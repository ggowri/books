  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing is impossible!" Osborne sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin's strength might have been on par with Armstrong's, but he was nowhere near the level of Gerardo, who had merged with the corpse of a deity. To Osborne now, Sin was insignificant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, Sin had spent his life honing the arts of assassination and ambush. He wasn't even Armstrong's equal when it came to direct combat. To think he could kill Osborne? That was nothing more than a pipe dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said calmly, "Sin, your era is over. The moment you and your Eityreia assassins targeted the Augustine family, your fate was sealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I killed your daughter, killed your wife, and now I'll kill you too. You can rest in hell knowing that. If you hurry, you may be reunited with them. No need to thank me for that. And as for these assassins you brought along, none are leaving here alive. They will all die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those icy words, Osborne moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still gripping Sin's arm with one hand, Osborne swung the Goddess of Grain's scythe with the other, aiming directly for Sin's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Sin's eyes widened, feeling the cold breath of death creeping closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Save me!" Sin screamed. His free hand moved, brandishing another divine artifact dagger to intercept the scythe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the dagger wasn't the top-grade divine artifact, it was still of Premium.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered, showing no concern. With an unstoppable force, the scythe came down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the dagger met the scythe, it was sliced clean in two and dropped to the ground with a clang. The scythe's momentum didn't falter, swiftly slashing across Sin's neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin's expression froze instantly. His mouth opened as if he wanted to say something, but no words came out. Blood quickly seeped from the thin line forming across his neck, and then, his head tilted and fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sin, the second-ranked assassin of the Eityreia Organization, was dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne sensed at least ten assassins from the Eityreia Organization rapidly closing in on him. Among them, two had auras nearly as powerful as Sin's. They were definitely top-tier Class S warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had come to save Sin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately for them, they were too late. All they could do was watch as Osborne severed Sin's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll pay for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you kill the Eityreia Organization's third-in-command&mdash;Lord Sin? You're a dead man!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dozen assassins, now consumed by fury, charged at Osborne, seeking revenge for Sin's death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne scoffed, "Perfect timing. I can test the power of Medusa's Gaze on you all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a beam of light suddenly shot from Osborne's right eye. "Petrify!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cold light hit the fastest of the assassins in an instant. The assassin's body froze immediately. His flesh and blood stiffened as stone layers began to creep over his skin. In the blink of an eye, he was transformed into a statue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up with satisfaction. "Though he was just an ordinary Class S, being petrified so quickly, it seems my Medusa's Gaze is even stronger than Gerardo's, who had merged with the corpse of the Goddess Medusa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was pleased. The light in his right eye flickered wildly as he turned each Eityreia Organization assassin charging at him into stone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the two top-tier Class S assassins couldn't escape the petrification, though they managed to break free after a brief struggle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, this gave Osborne valuable insights into Medusa's Gaze's power. "For ordinary Class S warriors, the petrification is inescapable. Once caught in the beam, they'll be fully turned to stone with no chance of breaking free!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for veteran Class S warriors, the effect lasts for about three seconds. After that, they can shake off the petrification, but their speed is severely reduced, and their strength is greatly diminished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And against the top-tier Class S warriors, Medusa's Gaze can only hold them for half a second. But even that's enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered. In a battle between experts, half a second was more than enough to determine victory or death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rot in hell!" Osborne moved swiftly, dispatching the entirely petrified Class S assassins with ease. Heads flew, and blood sprayed through the air like crimson rain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next were the veteran Class S warriors. Though they hadn't been completely turned to stone, their bodies were covered in thick, heavy layers of stone skin, leaving them stiff and sluggish. Their movements were slow, far too slow to escape Osborne's scythe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Osborne, they were nothing more than prey awaiting the inevitable. Slash! Slash! Slash!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, all but two of the top-tier Class S assassins had been killed. The remaining pair, realizing their doom, fled in a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene left the remaining Eityreia Organization assassins in shock. "Run!" they shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, every surviving assassin lost their will to fight. Fear consumed them, leaving only one thought in their minds: Run away quickly!</span></p><div class="pagination">
