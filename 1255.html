  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not every stone would melt in the lava. Within this river of molten rock, many such stones, with higher melting points than the surrounding magma, floated inconspicuously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this particular stone was extraordinary, emanating a faint energy fluctuation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This energy fluctuation was so weak that even Osborne, if not meticulously sensing, would have missed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was very familiar with this type of energy, a spatial fluctuation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, everything clicked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dimensional Space!" he murmured to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a space elemental metahuman, Osborne was intimately acquainted with Dimensional Space. He himself possessed one, where he stored many of his belongings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne's was not advanced enough to house living beings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inhabitants entering his Dimensional Space would perish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Osborne knew that some advanced Dimensional Spaces were akin to real worlds, complete with mountains and rivers, air, and energy, functioning as a completely independent microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was exceptionally rare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who would've thought the Thornberry family had their hands on a Dimensional Microcosm? No wonder they vanished without a trace once they arrived here. Even my Satan's Eye couldn't pierce through that veil&mdash;they must have slipped into the Dimensional Microcosm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This seemingly ordinary stone is the key to the Dimensional Microcosm! Concealing it in a lava river buried two miles deep underground? Talk about hiding in plain sight. If it weren't for my Satan's Eye and my relentless tracking of Helios, I wouldn't have sniffed it out either!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rapidly, Osborne weighed his options.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he knew Helios had entered the Dimensional Microcosm, he hesitated on whether to follow. He analyzed the risks: if he entered this Dimensional Microcosm, would he be discovered, and would there be danger?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimately, Osborne made his decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't go in! Despite my spatial powers allowing me to enter without a key, such a Dimensional Microcosm is like a divine artifact and must have been refined by someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unauthorized entry would surely alert them. Even with my spatial power, escape might be impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Entering is like stepping into a trap&mdash;once caught, even my immortality would be useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My power isn't sufficient; this is too risky."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Osborne felt a pang of regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew the Dimensional Microcosm likely harbored secrets of the Pantheon League, including the fabled Mount of Gods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The inability to see it firsthand gnawed at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, safety first. I'll come back when I'm stronger. Then, I'll claim the entire Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Augustine family could possess one, it would be much safer," Osborne mused, resolving to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today's discoveries were substantial enough. The priority now was to return and use his findings to enhance the Blood Demon's power. No more risks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thought, Osborne left a faint trail of spatial energy on the Dimensional Microcosm's carrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This faint spatial energy clung to the Dimensional Microcosm's carrier, nearly invisible to anyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, it naturally emitted a subtle spatial fluctuation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne could latch onto that delicate energy and lock in on the Dimensional Microcosm's location like a bloodhound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if the Pantheon League moved it to a more elusive spot in the future, he could easily track it down using this subtle spatial trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold resolve flickered in Osborne's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it comes to war with the Pantheon League, I'll strike straight at their Dimensional Microcosm and wipe their stronghold off the map! Pantheon League, you'd better not mess with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that firm thought, Osborne stepped into the parallel space and quickly returned to the surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After seeing what the Deschanel Clan is up to now, I should head back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, he spotted Joseph and the other warriors of the Deschanel Clan. They were flying silently above the ocean, speeding toward </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eighteen of them, each with a gloomy expression, their eyes simmering with barely contained fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, one warrior broke the silence. "Mr. Joseph Deschanel, are we really just going to let this slide?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's face was a stormy sea of emotions. He sighed heavily, "What else can we do? Charge back in? With just us? Do you really think we can take down the Pantheon League?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But we lost eighteen of our own!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We only have one hundred Sanctuary Caskets available, and now we're down eighteen! We can't just let this go unchallenged; it's eating me alive inside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! We have to make them pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And let's be real&mdash;the Pantheon League is strong. They've got a wealth of warriors who've held on for so long. If we don't eliminate them now, it'll just be a matter of time before they become a serious threat."</span></p><div class="pagination">
