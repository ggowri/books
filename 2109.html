  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the moment that Osborne's space elemental essence reached Level Ten, a tidal wave of information surged into his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Divine Ascendance Technique&mdash;Dimensional Maw!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flood of knowledge encompassed everything about spatial energy manipulation, culminating in a powerful new technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dimensional Maw was a technique that could collapse the fabric of reality using spatial energy, artificially creating a miniature black hole capable of wreaking havoc on anything within its gravitational pull.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly absorbed and understood this new information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dimensional Maw!" he murmured, extending his right hand, palm up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he did, terrifying spatial energy erupted from his hand, swirling and pulsating before rapidly converging, compressing, and collapsing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a black hole the size of his fist materialized in his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The surrounding space warped dramatically, light bending and being devoured as if it were a gaping abyss, locking everything within its terrifying gravitational grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a massive boulder, towering over 40 feet high and weighing tons, was caught in the black hole's pull from a hundred yards away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The boulder trembled violently, breaking free from the earth's grasp and hurtling toward Osborne's palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before it could even get close, the boulder began to disintegrate, shrinking rapidly until, with a soft pop&mdash;like a pebble dropping into the ocean&mdash;it vanished completely into the black hole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the rock disappeared without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but gasp in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gravitational force of the black hole even locked onto Alfreda, who was meditating nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, he quickly severed the black hole's gravitational effect, preventing any disruption to her training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's hesitation, he hurled the black hole away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black hole collided with the rocky wall of a chasm several hundred yards away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once-impenetrable surface melted away like ice meeting a hot iron, leaving behind a massive, gaping pit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the power of Dimensional Maw finally dissipated, all that remained was a bottomless hole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was left in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Umbra Earth, where the soil and rock were notoriously tough. Even with all his strength, he would struggle to cause widespread destruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just recently, his Spatial Clones had spent over a day attacking a massive black rock to uncover the Sacred Crystal hidden inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he realized that Dimensional Maw could shatter that same black rock with a single strike!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, catching his breath, "What incredible destructive power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reaching Level Ten in space elemental essence has granted me this one Divine Ascendance Technique&mdash;Dimensional Maw. But its potential is truly terrifying! Even an Ascension Six Supernal Deity King wouldn't stand a chance against it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, compared to Spatial Oblivion Slash, Dimensional Maw is a bit slower. Enemies could easily evade it... But the gravitational force it generates can lock onto foes directly! If someone gets caught in Dimensional Maw's pull, even an Ascension Six Supernal Deity King would struggle to break free, ultimately crushed and consumed by the black hole!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes sparkled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Dimensional Maw in his arsenal, he felt emboldened. Even if he faced an Ascension Six Supernal Deity King head-on, he wouldn't flinch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the very least, Osborne now had a means to defeat one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Level Ten space elemental essence is indeed powerful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Osborne wasn't just gaining a new Divine Ascendance Technique; the fact that his space elemental essence had reached Level Ten meant his Spatial Clone's power had significantly increased, making all his spatial abilities far more formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were to unleash a spatial arrow using the Bloodwrought Bow, even an Ascension Six Supernal Deity King would likely think twice before taking it head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, he was incredibly powerful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"According to Alfreda, Level Ten elemental essence is on the verge of Sacredness Level! Typically, only Ascension Eight, Nine, or even Ten Supernal Deity Kings can achieve Level Ten elemental essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here I am, at Ascension Two, and my space elemental essence has already hit Level Ten! In terms of elemental essence, I'm on par with Supernal Deity Kings above Ascension Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this isn't even my limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I'm also cultivating spatial, dark, and thunder powers. Now that my space elemental essence has reached Level Ten, I can't let my dark and lightning elemental essences lag behind. I'll push them all to Level Ten while I still can! Once that's done, my strength will skyrocket!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes sparkled with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had promised Alfreda to enhance his strength within ten days, and with only two days gone, he still had eight days left to elevate his dark and lightning elemental essences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside his Dimensional Space, he had amassed over a thousand Element Gold Crystals!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, the Dark Gold Crystals and Lightning Gold Crystals numbered more than fifty each.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was more than enough to push his dark and lightning elemental essences to Level Ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's keep going!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Osborne plunged back into his training, rapidly enhancing his dark and lightning elemental essences with the abundant Dark Gold and Lightning Gold Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The precious Element Gold Crystals were being consumed as if they were nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time flew by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three days later, Osborne's dark elemental essence finally transformed, reaching Level Ten. Instantly, a flood of information about dark power surged into his mind, dramatically improving his control over it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he unlocked a new dark Divine Ascendance Technique&mdash;Eclipse War Armor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Eclipse War Armor compressed a field of darkness to its utmost limit, forming a stunning suit of armor that enveloped his body, boasting immense defensive capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When struck, the Eclipse War Armor could absorb the enemy's power, store it, and unleash a barrage of dark rays that could severely injure foes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a quick test, Osborne found that the Eclipse War Armor's defense was nearly on par with the Bloodwrought Armor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even against a full-force attack from an Ascension Six Supernal Deity King, the Eclipse War Armor could withstand several hits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the Eclipse Destructive Rays unleashed by the Eclipse War Armor were equally impressive; while they might not match the Dimensional Maw in sheer power, their speed made them much harder to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, Osborne was thoroughly satisfied with the Eclipse War Armor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although its defensive capabilities still fell short of the Apex divine artifact&mdash;the Bloodwrought Armor&mdash;it had the potential to grow. As Osborne's strength increased, so would the power of the Eclipse War Armor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time he reached Ascension Three, its defense would rival that of the Bloodwrought Armor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And once he hit Ascension Four, the Eclipse War Armor would surpass it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In essence, the arrival of the Eclipse War Armor had significantly bolstered Osborne's defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next up, let's push my Thunder Power essence to Level Ten! I hope it brings me even more surprises!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
