  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, watch out for the Earth Spikes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn shouted, warning Osborne of the impending attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even without the warning, Osborne could already sense it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strong sense of danger rose from beneath his feet. Without hesitation, Osborne dodged away from his original spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next second, a sharp spike formed of earth elemental burst out from where Osborne had been standing. Had he not dodged quickly enough, this Earth Spikes would have at least drawn blood if not severely injured him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph, quick reflexes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But how long can you dodge?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna sneered from 328 feet away, waving her hands repeatedly. Instantly, one Earth Spike after another erupted from beneath Osborne's feet, relentless and unceasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were an ordinary person facing such an attack, they would have been riddled with holes like a pincushion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne dodged time and again, not getting touched by a single earth spike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It surprised Donna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earth Spikes were a common tactic among earth metahumans, known for their stealth and suddenness, often severely wounding opponents in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a Class C+ earth metahuman, her Earth Spikes were faster and more elusive than those of any typical earth metahuman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While some could dodge her Earth Spikes, none had done so with the ease Osborne showed, as if he had anticipated everything. Donna had never met anyone like him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn, who had been worried about Osborne, lit up with relief as he saw Osborne effortlessly dodge the continuous spikes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, you can't just attack Osborne; I'm your opponent too, you know?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Watch this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn swung his arm fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift wave of his hand, the ground beneath Donna's feet rippled with energy, and a thick Earth Spike erupted from the ground, lunging toward her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna scoffed, "You're still a long way off, kid! Even a turtle in a fishbowl could dodge such an obvious attack."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A solid slab of rock materialized beneath Donna's feet, intercepting the Earth Spike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spike shattered instantly, dissipating into nothingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn couldn't help but grimace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were both earth metahumans, but Donna was far superior in terms of ability level, control, and combat experience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was proving incredibly difficult, even inconvenient for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I can only serve as a distraction. Defeating my mother is up to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly. He had teamed up with Barlyn to avoid drawing too much attention, but in truth, he didn't need Barlyn to defeat Donna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Osborne wasn't planning to reveal too many of his trump cards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trump cards were meant for enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Donna was wary of him and somewhat dismissive of his abilities, she was definitely not an enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's thought, Osborne launched his counterattack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that the bullets from his Draco Model H mini-handgun wouldn't have any effect on a master like Donna, so he didn't even bother drawing his weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he dodged her spikes while rapidly closing the distance between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa had told him...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodies of elemental metahumans were as fragile as glass. If he could get close enough, they were done for!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was incredibly fast, covering 164 feet in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Donna sneered, "Trying to get close to me? Attack my physical weakness? Laughable! If elemental metahumans were that easy to attack, we'd all be extinct by now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she thrust her hands forward violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, a yellow wall materialized in front of Osborne, blocking his advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne just smiled faintly and launched a punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a loud bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tremendous boom echoed as the earthen wall trembled violently, a massive crater appearing in its center. Yet, it didn't crumble or fall, standing defiantly before Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Waves of yellow energy surged, rapidly mending the hole punched by his fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within a split second, the earthen wall was restored.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As expected, my physical strength alone isn't enough to break through a Class C+ metahuman's defense," Osborne thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna sneered, "Osborne, I suggest you surrender. Even if you defeated Paul and are considered a Class C martial artist, you won't be able to break through my Earth Wall!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unless it's shattered instantly, this wall can quickly regenerate. You could tire yourself to death and still not get close to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Donna wore a confident and smug expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled calmly, "Really, Ms. Donna Radcliffe? I'm afraid you're celebrating too early. Watch closely as I break through your earthen wall!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne activated Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ocular energy enveloped his fists, enhancing them with the strength to reach a limit of ten thousand pounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Osborne unleashed a punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Earth Wall before Osborne exploded instantly and shattered into countless fragments that vanished before they could regenerate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Donna was shocked, momentarily stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had already rushed before her</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seized her neck with a faint smile. "Ms. Donna Radcliffe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are dead!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
