  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but think, "Anastasia and Zoe really are twin sisters; they're both extraordinary!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's control over lightning is something else. Focus on Thunder Power? I'd better give up because I can't even come close to her level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Zoe's power? It's downright mysterious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Isa was eager to take her as a disciple. If Zoe uses her abilities wisely, she could be a game-changer, especially against a crowd of enemies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think I'm that amazing?" Zoe asked, a rosy blush creeping onto her cheeks at Osborne's praise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded earnestly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely! Trust me! You're going to be our secret weapon! With you by my side, I </span><span>won't even have to worry about being overwhelmed again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes sparkled with excitement as he continued, "Originally, I just wanted to scatter the Beast Tide to prevent them from attacking Newport City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now, I think we might actually be able to wipe them out completely!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused for a moment, contemplating the feasibility of that plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go! We need to check on the tiger first. If the situation allows, we'll strike down the Beast Tide!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne led Anastasia and Zoe deeper into the </span><span>Lostridge</span><span> Mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the outskirts were teeming with evolved </span><span>Ferocious Beasts, most were only Class C or B, which weren't his targets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew had mentioned that at least 200 thousand Ferocious Beasts were gathering in the </span><span>Lostridge</span><span> Mountains, and the number of Dark Exotic Beasts could easily exceed 10 thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those </span><span>were</span><span> the real threats Osborne was after!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of using interdimensional travel, Osborne opted for a more leisurely pace. The </span><span>Lostridge</span><span> Mountains spanned only a few hundred miles, and since he wasn't in a rush, he flew with the two girls as if they were on a casual outing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Occasionally, flying Ferocious Beasts would swoop down to attack them, but Osborne hardly needed to intervene. Each time, Zoe would simply utter a syllable, causing the attackers to lose their ability to fly and plummet to the </span><span>ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After covering over a hundred miles, they reached the heart of the </span><span>Lostridge</span><span> Mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Here, Osborne felt an overwhelming presence of Ferocious Beasts closing in around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he activated Satan's Eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before his slumber, it had already broken through to Level Seven, and now it had grown even stronger. With a sweeping glance, Osborne could see everything within a radius of several miles as clear as day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether they were hiding in dense foliage or lurking in caves, every Ferocious Beast was laid bare before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression shifted to one of seriousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "It looks like Matthew's intel was off! The number of Ferocious Beasts gathered here isn't just 200 thousand. It's at least 500 thousand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, most of them are Class D, C, or B, but there are over 50 thousand that are Class A or higher! And they're all Dark Exotic Beasts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face darkened at the realization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over 50 thousand Class A Dark Exotic Beasts, coupled with 500 thousand ordinary Ferocious Beasts&mdash;that was a staggering amount of power! When the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> attacked the Augustine Estate, it only had around 40 thousand Class A clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this Beast Tide launched an assault on Newport City, the casualties would be catastrophic; half the city could be in ruins!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne pondered, "Should I take action now to eliminate this swarm of Ferocious Beasts?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five hundred thousand is no joke!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if there aren't many Class AA or AAA Dark Exotic Beasts, their sheer numbers pose a serious threat. If I get surrounded, I could be in real trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, how long would it take to take down 500 thousand Ferocious Beasts?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do... do we jump in?" Anastasia and Zoe both turned to Osborne, awaiting his decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Osborne decided to give it a shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, let's give it a try! But let's be honest, it's not </span><span>gonna</span><span> cut it just with us.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are too many Ferocious Beasts spread out over dozens of miles. Trying to take them all out is a tall order!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First things first, we need backup."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne reached out to the Blood Demon members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, all of the Blood Demon members were Class S, even if most were just run-of-the-mill Class S. With four thousand eight hundred Class S warriors, that was an intimidating number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the surge in energy across the world and the rapid rise of power among the major superpowers, with people constantly breaking through their limits, having over four thousand eight hundred Class S warriors was still incredibly rare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the League of Divine Descent and the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization might have that many.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the League of Divine Descent was made up of thirty-six Divine Families, and if each family contributed just a hundred Class S warriors, that would already add up to three thousand six hundred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But did Osborne really believe that each Divine Family had just a hundred Class S warriors? No way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he thought about it, he felt the pressure mounting. He was already a sworn enemy of the League of Divine Descent, and they wouldn't let him off the hook.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with the Beast Tide sweeping across the globe right now, the League of Divine Descent was too busy to spare any attention for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> let's use this time to strengthen ourselves even more! When the League of Divine Descent comes knocking, we'll be ready to give them a big </span><span>surprise!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
