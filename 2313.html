  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Finally, fresh air!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne practically burst out of the Translocator on the sixth layer, a wave of relief washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, the seventh layer's icy grip hadn't really threatened him, not since he'd unleashed the Flames of the Dark Phoenix. Even without the Ascending Sacred Sanctum's protection, he'd have been fine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that bone-chilling cold still got under his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to that, the sixth layer's blizzards felt like a freaking sauna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That trip down to the seventh layer of the Arctic Maw Chasm was a total score!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A grin split Osborne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He</span><span> hauled back a hundred and fifty-seven Frost-kissed Hearts! With </span><span>their</span><span> little seventy-thirty deal, that's 110 for </span><span>him</span><span>! But that Primordial threw a hissy fit, so </span><span>he</span><span> had to promise it fifty-seven. Still le</span><span>ft</span><span> </span><span>him</span><span> with a hundred, though!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hundred Frost-kissed Hearts... If </span><span>he</span><span> gobble</span><span>d</span><span> them all up, </span><span>his</span><span> physical body could easily hit late-stage Sacredness! That'd put </span><span>him</span><span> in the running for strongest body among all the Empyrean Sacredness cultivators!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The best part is, </span><span>he</span><span> only need to siphon off the power of ten Frost-kissed Hearts to juice up the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity's Fusion Vessel, and boom! Third foundational carrier, solid as a rock! Then, blending the fourth power into </span><span>his </span><span>Sacred Power will be a walk in the park! Who knows, if </span><span>he</span><span> suck down all hundred, a fourth fusion base might even pop up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His</span><span> master plan is to fuse five powers before </span><span>he</span><span> even th</span><span>ought</span><span> about breaking through to Empyrean Sacredness! Looks like </span><span>he</span><span> might actually pull it off without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Too bad I'm on a clock! Gotta hold my horses until after the state duel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And don't forget, on the seventh layer, I rescued Agatha and even managed to swipe </span><span style="font-style: italic;">nine</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> drops of Phoenix Blood, igniting the Flames of the Dark Phoenix! Talk about a power boost! My fire elemental essence has finally caught up with my dark, space, and lightning essences, maybe even edged them out a bit!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">My overall strength has skyrocketed because of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Once I fuse that fire elemental essence into my Sacred Power, my Sacred Power's gonna pack the seriously nasty corrosive punch of the Flames of the Dark Phoenix!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">My Sacred Power will be off the charts! I might even be able to hold my own, maybe even win, against an Empyrean Sacredness powerhouse!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Bottom line, this little field trip to the seventh layer was a slam dunk!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's grin was practically glued to his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the state duel wasn't barreling towards its final day, and if the rules didn't mandate that all contestants should haul back to the Arctic Maw Chasm's first layer for the grand finale, Osborne would've happily stuck around on the seventh layer, hunting down more Frost-kissed Hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd scoured maybe seventy percent of that snow-covered mountain, and the remaining thirty percent probably held at least a few dozen more Frost-kissed Hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But hey, beggars couldn't be choosers. Gotta let it go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Time's ticking away, gotta get back to the first layer! Otherwise, I'll get disqualified for breaking the rules! And then, no zone duel, no Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that sobering thought, Osborne punched the Translocator's activation sequence and kicked off his journey back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasted no time zipping back to the fifth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the sixth day winding down, both the sixth and fifth layers were eerily deserted. Almost everyone had already gone back to the first layer for the final showdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the filming gear and referees had already packed up and left the fifth layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the Translocator's camera was still rolling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, the instant Osborne materialized on the fifth layer's Translocator, his mug was plastered all over the projection screens above Frost Peak City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, most of the spectators were too busy watching the mayhem unfold on the first layer to even notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And those who did notice didn't give it a second thought, except for Angela.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela's eyes locked onto the Translocator on the fifth layer the moment a figure popped into existence. She froze, her heart skipping a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Seriously? It's the sixth day of the state duel, and someone's just now crawling out of the sixth layer? Someone strong enough to reach the sixth layer didn't bother looting other teams and instead just chilled there the whole time?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of confusion washed over Angela's face as she squinted, trying to get a better look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Angela went rigid, and in a flash, she was on her feet, her face a mask of disbelief, her cheeks flushed. A wild buzz of excitement coursed through her veins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her sudden outburst startled Danilo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's up? What's wrong? Ms. Olsen, what is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela was practically vibrating with excitement. Hearing Danilo's voice, she frantically jabbed a finger at the corner of the projection screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne... Osborne, he's not dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's alive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's alive! Right there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela's words left Danilo utterly flabbergasted. He whipped his head around and saw Osborne had just strolled back to the fourth layer through the fifth layer's Translocator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked like he'd just stepped out of a spa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danilo was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wasn't dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few moments of unadulterated joy, Angela managed to pull herself together. She flashed a smile and said, "Good, he's not dead! Good! But he had the nerve to scare me half to death like that. Just wait until I get my hands on him, I'll give him a piece of my mind!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Angela plopped back down in her seat, her face glowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danilo, however, was still trying to wrap his head around it. "Osborne emerged from the sixth layer? You're telling me he's been holed up in the sixth layer for the last six days? He survived six days in the sixth layer, and he's still breathing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His jaw practically hit the floor. "Only the top twenty could pull off something like that, right? Does Osborne even have that kind of strength?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela shot him a quick glance and chuckled. "Who cares whether he does or doesn't? If he does, awesome! If not, so what? The important thing is he's alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danilo nodded in agreement. "What a bummer, though! He must've run into some kind of trouble in the sixth layer, and gotten stuck in a relatively safe zone! That's the only way to explain why the referees couldn't find him! And it's the only way he could've survived that long in the sixth layer without his score budging an inch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's only got 300 thousand points right now... that puts him way outside the top fifty. Even though there's still a day left in the state duel, there's no way he can rack up a decent score! Plus, with only 300 thousand points, he's gonna be a prime target for the heavy hitters once he gets back to the first layer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those powerhouses won't give him an inch. They'll definitely try to bleed him dry of points! I wonder how many points he'll manage to hold onto in the end, and if he'll even stay in the top hundred!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he can stay in the top hundred, he'll have already made history for our Mystic Sirius Sect."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Angela couldn't help but raise an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold onto the top hundred? I think... he can definitely do that! I believe in him! In fact, I'm betting his score will shoot up, and he'll crack the top fifty for sure!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danilo stared at Angela, his eyebrows shooting up in surprise. "Ms. Olsen, you really have that much faith in Osborne?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela shook her head. "Nope! This is me not having faith in him! If I actually had faith in him... well, then I'd be saying I believe he can muscle his way into the top ten."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Danilo's jaw dropped even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela took a deep breath, trying to sound nonchalant. "Anyway, I'm just stoked he's back! From here on out, we'll just sit back and watch him do his thing. I don't give a damn about his final score anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Angela flashed a genuine smile. "Unless, of course, he actually pulls a rabbit out of his hat and cracks the top ten. Now that would really knock my socks off."</span></p><div class="pagination">
