  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Water Domain, cast by Andrew, was still covering the arena. In such a situation,&nbsp;Stuart, who was already much weaker, could not stand up to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a flash,&nbsp;Stuart&nbsp;was knocked down by&nbsp;Andrew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His body collapsed heavily next to&nbsp;Rhett. His face filled with terror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is a trap?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart&nbsp;instantly understood.&nbsp;Andrew&nbsp;was intentionally humiliating&nbsp;Rhett&nbsp;to provoke his hot temper, hoping he would charge onto the arena again and violate the rules.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anyone who broke the arena's rules deserved to die, even if beaten to death!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment,&nbsp;Stuart's&nbsp;eyes filled with regret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just yesterday, he had fallen for a similar trick due to his impulsiveness and was nearly killed on the arena by&nbsp;Roger, a killer from the&nbsp;Eityreia Organization.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it weren't for&nbsp;Osborne, he would've been dead yesterday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, he deeply regretted not learning his lesson. He had once again fallen into&nbsp;Andrew's&nbsp;trap, putting himself in danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew&nbsp;was much stronger than&nbsp;Roger!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not only was&nbsp;Andrew&nbsp;one of the&nbsp;Godsons&nbsp;on the&nbsp;Global Godson Rankings, but he was also ranked 465. There was no way for&nbsp;Stuart&nbsp;to survive if&nbsp;Andrew&nbsp;wanted to kill him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you... are you part of the&nbsp;Eityreia Organization&nbsp;too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart&nbsp;gritted his teeth. "Otherwise, why are you trying to harm me? You're the heir of the&nbsp;Perry Family, one of the&nbsp;Secluded Families&nbsp;from&nbsp;Rosmandi. How could you be a hitman?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew&nbsp;sneered and replied, "I'm not a hitman! But&nbsp;Roger is my friend. He knew&nbsp;Rhett&nbsp;would challenge me, and he also knew how short-tempered you are. So, we came up with this plan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He said that as long as I kept humiliating&nbsp;Rhett, you wouldn't be able to hold back and would jump into the arena. And guess what? He was right. You fell for it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now, it's time for you to die!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A cold, murderous glint flashed in&nbsp;Andrew's&nbsp;eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sigh!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Down below the arena,&nbsp;Osborne&nbsp;couldn't help but sigh as he watched the miserable sight of&nbsp;Rhett&nbsp;and&nbsp;Stuart&nbsp;on the stage, feeling a bit helpless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He hadn't expected&nbsp;Andrew&nbsp;and&nbsp;Roger&nbsp;to be friends, and the constant insults toward&nbsp;Rhett&nbsp;were all part of a scheme targeting&nbsp;Stuart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With&nbsp;Stuart's&nbsp;explosive temper, it was no surprise that he fell for it again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Some things just won't let you rest, huh?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne&nbsp;muttered to himself. He knew it was time for him to step in again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No matter what, Aleena&nbsp;had asked him to pose as a member of the&nbsp;Lambert Family&nbsp;and come to&nbsp;Tethynia&nbsp;for the&nbsp;Honor Quest Ceremony. He owed her a favor, and there was no way he could just stand by and let&nbsp;Andrew&nbsp;kill&nbsp;Stuart&nbsp;like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Having made up his mind,&nbsp;Osborne&nbsp;began walking toward the arena.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I really just wanted to observe. I had no intention of getting involved. I simply wanted to see the strength of the younger generation and prepare for my own&nbsp;Honor Quest Ceremony&nbsp;in twenty days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why must you force me to act?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By the time he finished speaking,&nbsp;Osborne&nbsp;had already reached the front of the arena.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment,&nbsp;Andrew&nbsp;had lifted his foot, aiming to crush&nbsp;Stuart's head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone around, including&nbsp;Jackie&nbsp;from the&nbsp;Diviner League, didn't intervene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all,&nbsp;Stuart&nbsp;had broken the rules by jumping into the arena, interrupting the fight between&nbsp;Andrew&nbsp;and&nbsp;Rhett. Even if&nbsp;Andrew killed him, it would be justified.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Die!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew's&nbsp;face twisted in a sinister grin, and his foot was about to come down on&nbsp;Stuart's&nbsp;head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A tall figure appeared before him in the next second, throwing a punch that sent him flying backward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew&nbsp;stumbled back a few steps, then steadied himself and saw&nbsp;Osborne&nbsp;standing before him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instead of anger, his eyes lit up with surprise, and he burst into laughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hahaha!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, well, well! So, you got on the stage too? Are all of you from the&nbsp;Lambert Family&nbsp;such fools? Coming up here one after another to break the rules? Perfect. I'll just kill you all together and save myself the trouble."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a look of disdain,&nbsp;Andrew&nbsp;glared at&nbsp;Osborne, clearly not taking him seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne&nbsp;ignored him and turned to&nbsp;Stuart, saying, "Get&nbsp;Rhett&nbsp;out of here! Leave this to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart&nbsp;struggled to stand, feeling ashamed as he saw&nbsp;Osborne&nbsp;once again stepping into the ring to save him, facing such a powerful opponent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Axell, I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't say anything!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne&nbsp;cut him off. "Next time, don't be so impulsive! You've been secluded for too long. You don't know how dangerous the world outside can be. That's why you keep falling into their traps. Be more careful in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying that,&nbsp;Osborne&nbsp;waved his hand dismissively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart&nbsp;felt overwhelmed with guilt, but he said nothing more. He helped the unconscious&nbsp;Rhett&nbsp;up and prepared to leave the stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Axell, be careful!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmph!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment,&nbsp;Andrew&nbsp;snorted coldly, saying, "Did I say you could leave?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Rhett&nbsp;can go. He's a worthless piece of trash. But you two violated the arena's rules. Who said you could leave? Both of you are staying right here!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm going to slowly torture both of you to death!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as he finished speaking,&nbsp;Stuart's&nbsp;face went pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne, however, remained calm and said, "Just keep going. Don't worry about him. I'll hold him off."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stuart&nbsp;gritted his teeth and took large strides toward the edge of the arena.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You bastard! Stop right there!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrew&nbsp;attacked fiercely, summoning terrifying torrents of water from his&nbsp;Water Domain&nbsp;to strike at&nbsp;Stuart.</p><div class="pagination">
