  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before breaking through to Level Seven in space elemental essence, Osborne had been confident he could take down a mid-tier Deity Overlord warrior with all his might.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, he felt he could hold his own even against a late-stage Deity Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The leap in power from Level Six to Level Seven was monumental, not to mention he had ascended from the early to the peak stage of Transcendent Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the current circumstances of Osborne, even when facing a common Deity Overlord at the pinnacle, he had the confidence to engage in battle and even had the capability to defeat them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now I finally have a fighting chance in Celestara! As long as I don't run into a Deity King warrior, I can face anything without fear. Even if I can't win, I can easily escape. I'm practically invincible!" he mused, though a twinge of regret crept in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If only the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity were fully restored!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then I wouldn't have to worry even if I encountered a Deity King warrior. After all, I could always rely on it to come back to life..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The thought made him anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I didn't come to Divine Peak Nine just to help the Wild Flame Army with their errands! My goal is the death scent liquid! I need to get my hands on it fast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that in mind, Osborne decided it was time to head back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had been out for six days, and it was time to report back and wrap up the mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as he was about to set off, his expression suddenly hardened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A voice echoed urgently in his mind&mdash;Riley's voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"My Lord, we've got a situation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ms. Barrymore just entered a breakthrough state&mdash;she's about to become a Deity Overlord! But right now, we're surrounded by a horde of powerful Deathborn!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They're too strong; I can't hold them off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Riley's panicked tone sent a wave of dread through Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hang in there! Whatever it takes, protect Diana! Even if you have to sacrifice yourselves, make sure she stays safe until I get back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that command, Osborne took off at full speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was about to break through to Deity Overlord!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It had only been five days since she was just a late-stage Celestial Deity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In such a short time, she had not only reached the pinnacle of Celestial Deity but was now on the verge of becoming a Deity Overlord!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but marvel at her talent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Diana must have some kind of special physique. Her ability to absorb Essence Crystal energy is off the charts! In just five days, she's taken in over sixty Ultimate Essence Crystals&mdash;that's hundreds of times faster than Riley! No wonder her progress is so rapid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I just hope she can keep up this pace. If she can, with enough Ultimate Essence Crystals, she might even reach the peak of Deity Overlord or even challenge a Deity King!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The urgency of the situation gnawed at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was not just a friend; she was part of the Human Community, and her extraordinary talent made her someone he couldn't afford to lose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Osborne realized he was over a 100 thousand miles away from the 53rd mining area. Even traveling in the Supreme Malevolence Airship, which could fly at speeds exceeding 600 thousand miles per hour, it would take nearly ten minutes to reach her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ordinary Deity King warriors moved at a similar pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Given Riley's report, it was clear they wouldn't be able to hold out that long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In a flash of relief, Osborne remembered his recent breakthrough to Level Seven in space elemental essence. His mastery over space was now incredibly potent. With interdimensional travel, he could cover over six thousand miles in a single leap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After just a few jumps through dimensions, he found himself back at the 53rd mining area, and all of it took less than a minute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His figure materialized deep in the mining area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne immediately felt the surge of powerful energy waves and witnessed an intense battle unfolding before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A dozen Deathborns were relentlessly assaulting Riley and the others, trying to break through their defenses to reach Diana, who was in the midst of her breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The scene was grim; two bodies lay lifeless on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They belonged to two members of the Celestial Deity elite guard, who had managed to escape death at Osborne's hands only to meet their end here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead of being killed, they had been transformed into Blood Clan members, but that fate hadn't saved them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their bodies were crushed by a powerful Deathborn before the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity could intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, the entire Celestial Deity contingent had been wiped out, leaving only Riley and two early-stage Deity Overlord warriors struggling to hold the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their situation was dire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Deathborn attacking them were far too strong, led by one that radiated divine power even greater than Riley's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"A late-stage Deity Overlord Deathborn!" Riley gasped, recognizing the threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alongside the leader were two mid-stage Deity Overlord Deathborns, with the rest being early-stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Osborne hadn't arrived just in time, Riley and his companions would have surely fallen to this overwhelming force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes turned icy as he surveyed the battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Glad I made it back just in time! A late-stage Deity Overlord Deathborn, huh? Perfect. Let's see how my strength measures up against you..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
