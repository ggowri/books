  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stayed alone for a long time before finally coming to his senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fourth successor test had begun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This test was different from the previous three. It actually required Osborne to pursue Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but smile wryly and wonder, "How am I supposed to pursue her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa is of noble birth and the most esteemed heiress of the prestigious Radcliffe family. She is the epitome of grace, with three unique powers. Most importantly, she's engaged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her fianc&eacute; is no less prestigious than she is.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And what about me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring the fact that I'm the Godfather's grandson, I'm just a commoner who is an orphan and has been divorced. Although I have some money now, there's still a significant social gap between Clarissa and me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could I possibly win Clarissa over?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the Godfather hadn't set a time limit for this task, giving Osborne plenty of time to figure out a way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, there wasn't much time left. Anastasia's illness could only hold out for another year at most. He had to complete the six successor tests and raise his rank to six-star within that year. That was the only way to save her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, he knew he couldn't spend too much time on this fourth test.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne muttered to himself, "No matter what, I do have feelings for Clarissa. Even if this attraction is mostly physical, at least I'm not against it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's just take it one step at a time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne then returned to the Radcliffe Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, Donna had forbidden him from closely guarding Clarissa, and he was happy with that arrangement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now that the Godfather wanted Osborne to court Clarissa, he naturally needed to appear more often in front of her to gain her favor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Donna, Osborne didn't care about her. He considered that anyone who stood in the way of him completing the successor tests was his enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He might have feared Donna in the past. But now, she was no longer a match for him, and he couldn't care less about her thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after, Osborne arrived at the Radcliffe Manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you're back! I was just about to call you," Barlyn said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the matter? Did something happen?" Osborne asked in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn replied, "We've already found Raymond's hideout."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Already?" He exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was incredibly surprised and wondered how they had managed to locate Raymond in less than two hours. Given Raymond's role as The Aberrants' assassin, he should be hidden in a very secluded spot. Osborne had expected it would take several days to track him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn explained, "That's the power of the Chevalier family. Clarissa called them, and they immediately agreed to help. Half of Mayby City's underground gangs started looking for clues about Raymond. Moreover, the Enforcement Team in Mayby City was also mobilized to check surveillance and investigate suspects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's how we managed to find Raymond's hideout within two hours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't feel excited after hearing that. Instead, he felt very solemn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pondered, "The Chevalier family's might is more powerful than I expected!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And I'm supposed to pursue Clarissa, competing with Apollo from the Chevalier family for her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I do this, I will be in great danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forget it! I'll capture Raymond first, consume his lightning elemental essence, and activate the new abilities of Satan's Eye. By then, I'll be more powerful and may not have to fear the Chevalier family anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking this through, Osborne nodded and asked, "Where is Raymond hiding?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We'll discuss that later. My mom is still waiting for you to have a meeting and plan the attack. Let's head over together," Barlyn said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," Osborne agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after, they entered the villa. Inside were Donna, Clarissa, members of the Personal Guards, and the three deputy leaders, Harris, Sharon, and Violet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Augustine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sharon and Violet greeted Osborne with a smile on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris, on the other hand, just glanced at him without speaking, his face showing discontent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't mind. He just smiled and nodded at Sharon and Violet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, now that everyone is here, let's start the meeting," Donna said. "Osborne, we've found Raymond's hiding place, thanks to the Chevalier family. It only took them a little over an hour. The influence of the Chevalier family is becoming more terrifying, far surpassing that of the Radcliffe family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face took on a peculiar look after he heard her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pondered, "Even now, Donna is still speaking in riddles, trying to warn me? Is she trying to tell me not to have unrealistic dreams because the Chevalier family is so powerful?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it had been in the past, Osborne would have acted as if he hadn't heard it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, his test was to pursue Clarissa, which meant he would inevitably become a rival to the Chevalier family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne spoke calmly, "The Chevalier family is indeed very powerful, but unfortunately, they are not good people. They control both Mayby City's Enforcement Team and its underground gangs, making the city's law and order chaotic, and the citizens are full of complaints.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they continue like this, they will eventually what's coming to them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking, a sudden silence fell over the room. Donna and Barlyn stared at him, wide-eyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!" Barlyn exclaimed. He then lowered his voice and said, "You shouldn't speak like that. If the Chevalier family hears about this, you will be in trouble."</span></p><div class="pagination">
