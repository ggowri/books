  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled and said, "I bet you've all been waiting anxiously. Let's go meet Fabian now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words prompted a flurry of exchanged glances among the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lachlan Swift, you actually broke through?" Betty exclaimed, her eyes widening as she looked up at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, the Divine Flame above his head had transformed from four petals to five, and the color had shifted from green to azure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This signified that he had not only advanced from Transcendent Deity to Celestial Deity but had also evolved his Divine Body from Level Four to Level Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty was utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just three short hours, Osborne had caught up to her and her sisters in strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The speed of his breakthrough was astonishing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, her expression quickly shifted to concern. "Mr. Lachlan Swift, are we really going out there? Even with your new power, the four of us together wouldn't stand a chance against Fabian! Plus, there are many powerful factions outside, and they've even called in a hunting team!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, a serious look crossed Betty's face, tinged with desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised an eyebrow. "A hunting team, you say?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph! Seems like they all thought I was a goner! They want to take advantage of you all, huh? Well, let them come! Since they're here, we might as well make a name for Spark of Blaze. Let's show the other factions that they should think twice before messing with us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he strode purposefully toward the exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Betty and the others were taken aback, struggling to understand where Osborne's confidence was coming from.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with the closing time of the slave market drawing near, security personnel had already gathered around, making it impossible for them to stay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a determined bite of her lip, Betty exchanged resolute glances with Thera and Sophia before following Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren and the others felt a mix of unease and reluctant trust, but they had no choice but to stick together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they could only hope that Osborne truly had a plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over five thousand people followed Osborne as they made their way out of the slave market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere outside instantly buzzed with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're coming out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! That pathetic little human hid until the last moment in the slave market, only coming out when it was about to close!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! He's a goner for sure!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once he's out of the picture, those slaves behind him will be up for grabs! It's every faction for themselves!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Voices in the crowd rang out, their disdain for Osborne clear and unfiltered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian's eyes snapped open at the commotion, locking onto Osborne with a mix of scorn and malice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, surprise flickered across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, you actually broke through? From Transcendent Deity to Celestial Deity? And your Divine Body has evolved from Level Four to Level Five!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Celestial Deity with a Level Five Divine Body is quite the catch among the younger generation in Wild Flame City. Too bad you crossed me. Even with your breakthrough, you're still nothing more than an ant in my presence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, if you immediately apologize and hand over those slaves behind you, I might let you live. You could even become my servant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, I can turn you into mincemeat with a single blow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian's confident proclamation drew gasps of astonishment from the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared in awe at the Divine Flame hovering above Osborne's head, murmuring in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Among the younger generation, breaking through to Celestial Deity with a Level Five Divine Body is definitely impressive! Too bad he's just a lowly member of the Human Community, and even worse, he's crossed Fabian and the other powerful factions!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a shame for such a talent! If he refuses to submit to Fabian and become his slave, he's about to get crushed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at Calvin from the Swift family; his face is like thunder!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvin's expression was indeed gloomy. When he realized that "Lachlan" had advanced to Celestial Deity and possessed a Level Five Divine Body, he was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Calvin himself was only a Celestial Deity, and with his Level Four Divine Body, it meant that Osborne's potential was greater than his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Calvin was at the peak of Celestial Deity, the difference in their Divine Bodies meant he might not be much stronger than "Lachlan" at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! Why does he get to have a Level Five Divine Body? If only I had one!" Calvin fumed silently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that moment, no one paid much attention to his thoughts. Everyone was focused on Osborne, eager to see what he would do next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would he submit to Fabian and become his slave?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or would he foolishly challenge Fabian, only to be reduced to a bloody pulp?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fabian sneered. "I'm giving you a minute to think it over! Become my slave, and at least you'll live to see another day. If you're foolish enough to resist, I'll turn you into mush with a single punch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled, finally breaking his silence. "Fabian, who gave you the confidence to think you can turn me into mush with one punch?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really have that kind of ability?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You want me to be your slave? Apologize to you? Do you think you're worthy of that?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
