  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, Osborne felt his powers sealed, leaving him utterly powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face paled as he stared at Gerardo, shock etched across his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he felt like an ordinary person&mdash;stronger than the average human, perhaps, but devoid of any trace of his once-mighty abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even his Satan's Eye was rendered useless!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell is happening?" Osborne wondered, panic creeping into his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo smirked, an air of superiority radiating from him. "Don't worry, I'm not going to kill you&mdash;at least not yet. I've simply used a divine artifact&mdash;the God Binding Rope&mdash;to suppress your powers. This thing can even restrain the strength of deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My goal is Sebastian. Once I take him out, if you still refuse to bow to me, I'll annihilate your soul and turn your body into one of my puppet warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all, it'd be a waste to kill someone with your talent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's shock deepened. "A divine artifact? The God Binding Rope?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo's smile widened as he led Osborne down to a small island below. He had seemingly retracted all his power, appearing as just an ordinary old man strolling casually alongside Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they walked, Gerardo asked, "So, kid, do you know where we are?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had no idea and remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo continued, "This little island doesn't have a name! But I call it 'Shame Island' because decades ago, it was here that Sebastian defeated me, and I lost control of the underground world of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"For years, I've been plotting my revenge, dreaming of killing Sebastian and reclaiming what's rightfully mine. I want to return to </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> and take back my throne in its underworld.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After all this time, I'm finally close to achieving that goal! Once I kill Sebastian, I can reclaim my place in </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>, becoming its ruler once more!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've waited far too long for this day, and I won't wait any longer. I brought you here to force Sebastian's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Decades ago, he humiliated me here. Now, I'll wash away that shame with his blood!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Gerardo spoke, a terrifying aura emanated from him, filling the air with dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne bit his lip, a defiant glint in his eyes. "Maybe you won't wash away your shame but end up in an even more disgraceful position!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo merely chuckled, the menace in his aura dissipating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He regarded Osborne calmly. "You have no idea how powerful I am now! But soon enough, you'll see. When Sebastian arrives, I'll kill him right in front of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, they had reached the center of the island, standing before a small cabin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young man stood there, waiting respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Gerardo and Osborne approached, the young man quickly said, "Mr. Aniston."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo waved him off casually, his gaze fixed on the cabin. "Every year, I come here for a bit, just to remind myself of the shame. After I kill Sebastian in a few days, I won't have to return here ever again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he handed Osborne over to the young man. "George, keep a close eye on him! He's got serious potential, and I'll need him later. Don't let him die! Also, use our intel network to spread the word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't care where Sebastian is hiding; he needs to know that Osborne is in my hands. If he wants to keep Osborne alive, he better show up here on Shame Island to meet me!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm giving him just five days!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Gerardo finished speaking, he cast a lingering glance at Osborne with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Mr. Aniston!" George replied respectfully to Gerardo before turning to Osborne with a mocking grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a firm grip on Osborne's shoulder, he forcefully dragged Osborne into a small room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, there stood a massive iron cage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without any means to resist, Osborne was quickly confined within its bars, the binding ropes sealing away his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne glared at George, fury blazing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But George merely chuckled, his expression unfazed. "What's that? Who do you think you are to glare at me? Mr. Aniston only ordered me not to kill you&mdash;he didn't say I couldn't have a little fun!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wicked spark in his eyes, George unleashed a burst of flames that struck Osborne's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, the fire began to sear his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's face contorted in pain, but he clenched his teeth and glowered at George even more intensely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're George, right? I'll remember you. Once I get out of here, I'm going to make you pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>George threw his head back and laughed. "Get out? You actually think you can escape? Do you really believe Sebastian will come to your rescue? Hilarious!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Sebastian dares to show his face, he'll be dead for sure! This time, Mr. Aniston will finish him off for good! And by then, you won't mean a thing. Your fate will be far </span><span>worse than death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, George shot another volley of flames toward Osborne, reveling in the torment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne bit down hard, keeping silent, but inside, his murderous intent was boiling over.</span></p><div class="pagination">
