  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne said after a thorough inspection of the diamonds, "Alright, I've made my choices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These uncut diamonds look promising; they should contain some high-quality gems. Let's buy them all. We should make a substantial profit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He handed over the list of uncut diamonds he wanted to Austin, instructing her to purchase them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin glanced at the list and gasped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So many?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The list included over forty diamonds, with prices ranging from tens of thousands to tens of millions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought to herself, "The total price could easily exceed 100 million dollars. That's a lot of money!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If we don't get high-quality diamonds from all these, we'll be at a serious loss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn, however, had complete faith in Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't waste time questioning it. If Osborne says we'll profit, then we will. Even if we don't, he just helped me make 200 million. If you're worried about losing money, I'll cover the cost of these uncut diamonds."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin shot him a glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's with the heroics? Did I say I'm worried about losing money? Did I say I don't trust Osborne?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And by the way, do you even have the money to buy these uncut diamonds?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll handle the payment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin then quickly headed off to negotiate the purchase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go to the cutting warehouse," Osborne said to Barlyn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They headed to the facility where the uncut diamonds would be cut, waiting for the delivery to begin processing them on-site.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Wesley and Ophelia finally arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley's face was twisted with rage, and his eyes were filled with a deadly glare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spotted Osborne, his anger flared even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, you pathetic fool! How dare you show up at my diamond dealing market again? Do you have a death wish? You'd better believe you're leaving here on your back today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a wave of his hand, Wesley signaled his security team. Dozens of guards surrounded Osborne and Barlyn, ready to strike at a moment's notice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think you're tough? Not only will I refuse to sell you a single diamond, but I'll also make sure you pay for every penny you've earned in the past!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled, an amused smirk on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Ashford, the diamond dealing market is open for business. It seems you're not too thrilled about having me around. Refusing to sell me diamonds might not be the best move, don't you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley sneered, "I won't sell. What are you going to do about it? You're just a sycophant who flatters women. Let's see which foolish woman you've impressed this time. Daring to challenge the Ashford family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where's that foolish woman? She better come out and apologize now, or I swear I'll make sure she spends her next life as a prostitute!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley's rage was palpable, his arrogance on full display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Barlyn was furious and about to speak up when a cold, icy voice cut through the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wesley, calling me a foolish woman?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Threatening me with a future as a prostitute? You've got some nerve!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're looking for trouble, I'll be happy to oblige!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin's voice was chilling, and everyone could feel the coldness in her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley looked up, frowning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, he didn't recognize the made-up Austin and dismissed her with a contemptuous sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You pathetic woman, what gives you the right to speak so boldly on Ashford family turf?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin's anger flared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She advanced toward Wesley, step by step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley's bodyguards immediately closed ranks around him, but Wesley waved them off dismissively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let her come closer! I want to see if she dares to lay a finger on me. If she touches me, I'll make sure she leaves on a stretcher!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the guards parted, making way for Austin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin marched up to Wesley, her face set in a steely expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Wesley, huh? Today, not only am I going to beat the crap out of you, but I also want your old man to come to my place and apologize in person! If not, your chance of becoming the heir will be over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, Austin swung her hand, her movement sharp and precise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a martial artist trained rigorously by the Montague family, Austin's skills were formidable. Wesley, on the other hand, was nothing more than a pampered playboy who had never lifted a finger in training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no way he could dodge Austin's strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The resounding slap landed squarely on Wesley's face, sending him spinning through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia's eyes widened in alarm as she rushed to support Wesley, her voice cutting through the chaos. "Who do you think you are? How dare you hit Wesley?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Austin smirked. "I was aiming for him! If you've got a problem with it, I'll take you down too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ophelia was livid, but the fierce aura radiating from Austin made her hesitate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could only shout angrily at Osborne, "Osborne, look at the mess you've caused! The woman you brought here just hit Wesley. You're all finished!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sneered dismissively, showing no sign of concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesley finally snapped out of his daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face twisted in rage as he roared, "You filthy bitch! How dare you hit me? You're going to pay for this. I'll make sure you're dead! I swear, I'll kill you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Beat the hell out of this bitch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Wesley's bodyguards surged toward Austin, their faces twisted in fury.</span></p><div class="pagination">
