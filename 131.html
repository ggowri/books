  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he was the only candidate for captain, Osborne was confident that Sharon and Violet would support him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he had shown them the Draco Star Wristlet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To them, Osborne was one of their own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if Sharon and Violet had a chance to become bodyguard captains, the outcome would be uncertain. People look out for themselves. They might vote for themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or they might discuss and decide to vote for one of them, ensuring at least one of them becomes the captain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Osborne, although he had the Draco Star Wristlet and a higher status in the Draco Group, it wasn't enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his high status, Osborne was not their direct superior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne didn't have the authority to command them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So Osborne knew he had to do something to ensure the captain position wouldn't slip away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he missed this opportunity due to another mishap, Osborne might fail the heir test.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was absolutely unacceptable to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Donna Radcliffe, may I say a few words to campaign for myself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna frowned but nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll give you five minutes. You can campaign for votes among yourselves. I'll only look at the results."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave Violet and Sharon a look. They hesitated but walked over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, we know what you want to say, but we're sorry. This is also a great opportunity for us. We don't want to miss it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sharon said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Violet didn't speak, but it was clear. If it didn't concern their interests, they would stand with Osborne. But this was also their chance. Becoming the bodyguard captain would bring them many benefits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were unwilling to give it up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled bitterly and said, "I understand. You're not wrong to do this. If I were in your shoes, I'd do the same. But I still want to ask you to vote for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sharon and Violet frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because I must become the bodyguard captain. Anyone in my way is my enemy! Of course, I don't want to be enemies with you. I'll compensate you for any losses."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thinking momentarily, Osborne said, "How about a Class B Defensive Soft Armor for each of you? You know I'm the owner of the Draco Star Wristlet. Even with two-star access, I can still buy Class B Defensive Soft Armor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you give me this chance, I promise that I'll buy you higher-grade individual equipment once my access level increases!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne seriously finished speaking, their eyes lit up. They were clearly tempted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Class B Defensive Soft Armor was worth fifty million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it's not something they could buy just with money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were currently using Class D individual equipment. They didn't even qualify for Class C, let alone Class B.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they became bodyguard captains, it would be hard to earn enough to buy a Class B Defensive Soft Armor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They quickly exchanged glances and saw each other's interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you serious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing their interest, Osborne quickly said, "I swear on the Draco Star Wristlet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright! We agree!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're the owner of the Draco Star Wristlet. Your status is higher than ours. We shouldn't be competing with you. You've come to us openly, offering compensation with Class B Defensive Soft Armor. We can't refuse that. We have no reason not to agree."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Violet said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sharon nodded. "We will vote for you and help you become the bodyguard captain. We'll also fully cooperate with your work in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing their promises, Osborne finally felt relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the voting wasn't over yet, and anything could still happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris was also interested in the position of bodyguard captain. After Osborne spoke, he called Sharon and Violet over and quietly discussed something with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, he had also promised them benefits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the benefits he promised couldn't be worth more than Class B Defensive Soft Armor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, let's start the voting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna interrupted them and said calmly. She didn't think Osborne could get the other three to vote for him. The so-called campaigning was just a waste of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that Sharon and Violet were from Skyefall Security Services. They would definitely discuss and decide on one of them becoming the bodyguard captain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harris, you go first. Who do you vote for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harris took a deep breath and said, "A soldier who doesn't want to be a general isn't a good soldier. Naturally, I vote for myself. I hope to advance further, become the bodyguard captain, and better protect Ms. Radcliffe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna nodded and smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of the three deputy captains, Harris voted for himself and not Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This meant that as long as either Sharon or Violet didn't vote for Osborne, he couldn't become the bodyguard captain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Violet and Sharon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about you two?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
