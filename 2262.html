  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the fourth day of the city duel, the battles for the top sixteen finally commenced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne arrived at the arena early, and the only others still seated in the competitors' area were Jamar and Bethan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of them wore serious expressions, a stark contrast to Osborne's relaxed demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Osborne hadn't paid much attention to the group matches, Jamar and Bethan had been glued to every fight, knowing that each contender stood in the way of their goal to break into the top ten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at Osborne, all chill and carefree," Jamar sighed, a hint of envy in his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the top sixteen contenders faced off, each participant would have to fight fifteen matches over the next three days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't just a test of strength; it was also a challenge of strategy. Knowing when to fight and when to conserve energy was crucial. If they faced an opponent they had no chance of beating, it was better to forfeit than to risk exhaustion or injury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right then, Jamar and Bethan were hashing out which matches they ought to forfeit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bethan said, her brow knitted in deep thought, "Leroy is undoubtedly a force to be reckoned with. As the clear favorite for the championship, we don't stand a snowball's chance against her. We might as well just forfeit that match."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar chimed in, "Couldn't agree more. Marreese and Tyson both fight like wild animals. Even if there was a tiny glimmer of hope, it's not worth the risk of getting seriously hurt. We've got to think about the later rounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And then there's Clara... she's powerful, but she never really pulls out all the stops. She just uses that divine artifact chain to tie her opponents up. We could take a shot at her, but it'd burn up too much of our energy. It's better to pass on that one too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly, and if we end up facing Pero..." Bethan paused for a moment before continuing, "We might as well skip Osborne as well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their conversation made Osborne stifle a laugh, but he could see where they were coming from. Their aim was simply to make it into the top ten, and in theory, they only had to outperform six other competitors to reach that goal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pressure was on, and they needed a well-thought-out strategy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Truth be told, it wasn't just them. Everyone else in the running for a top-ten spot would follow suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The announcer boomed, "Ladies and gentlemen, the top-sixteen matches are about to kick off!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First on the docket, we've got Pero from Azure Haven Academy squaring off against Tyson from Fantasia Isle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd went wild with cheers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The excitement was practically tangible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, the opening match is a real heavy-hitter! Tyson was the runner-up last year, and Pero snagged third place! This showdown is going to be a real barnburner!" someone in the audience hollered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who do you reckon will come out on top?" another person asked, eyes wide with eagerness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a toss-up! It's been a decade since then, and Tyson's definitely stepped up his game, but Pero's no slouch, either. It could go either way, and we might even see both of them end up banged up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If they both go down, it could create an opening for someone else to come out of nowhere and seize the opportunity!" another voice piped up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the crowd hummed with wild guesses, Tyson and Pero took their stances on the arena floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson oozed an air of superiority. His very presence was so overwhelming that it felt like it could choke the life out of anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed a menacing glare on Pero. "Pero, let's cut the crap. You don't stand a chance against me. Just throw in the towel now. If I end up hurting you, it might mess up your chances in the later rounds. You might not even make it into the top five!" Tyson jeered, a smug smirk dancing on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pero's expression turned steely, his eyes narrowing into slits. "You're so cocky, Tyson! Yeah, I lost to you last time, but things are different this time around. I'm </span><span>gonna</span><span> beat you and earn my place in the top three!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson rolled his eyes, clearly unimpressed. "Top three? You think you can take down Marreese? If you can't, what makes you think Azure Haven Academy can sweep the podium? Fat chance! I, for one, won't let that happen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine! If you're not </span><span>gonna</span><span> back off, then let's get this fight underway!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get ready to eat dirt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson didn't waste a second. He whipped out a sleek, jet-black spear over ten feet long. It practically oozed an intimidating aura of power. It was a quasi-Sacred Artifact, a weapon grade that showed he was no run-of-the-mill competitor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Truth be told, every fighter in the top sixteen had their own quasi-Sacred Artifact; no one was willing to skimp on their armaments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pero let out a derisive snort and brandished his long sword. "The fight will show </span><span>whose</span><span> mightier&mdash;your spear or my sword! Let's see who's got the real chops!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get this show on the road!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a deafening crash, the fierce battle kicked off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne found himself drawn to the arena, transfixed by the clash of two top-notch warriors under the Empyrean Sacredness. The intensity of their fight was truly a sight to behold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tyson's spear blazed with flames while Pero's sword crackled with electric energy. Right from the get-go, both fighters poured out their maximum strength. Soon, the arena was engulfed in a dazzling spectacle of fire and lightning, with the two forces colliding and annihilating each other in a jaw-dropping display.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Looks like Pero's in a tight spot!" Osborne murmured under his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar and Bethan exchanged confused looks. Both of them were fixated on the fight, but they couldn't tell who had the edge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like a dead-even match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer might </span><span>exuded</span><span> by the two sent shivers down their spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne smiled with a knowing look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Satan's Eye had already seen through the situation. Although it seemed like a stalemate on the surface, Pero was pouring every bit of his energy into the fight, while Tyson was still holding back, conserving his strength for later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless Pero had some secret weapon up his sleeve, the outcome was pretty much set.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the battle wore on, Osborne's prediction came true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Tyson stepped up his game, Pero found himself on the back foot, struggling to parry Tyson's fiery spear. The color drained from his face as he realized he was losing ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I concede!" Pero </span><span>finally roared,</span><span> his voice laced with frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was afraid that if he kept going, he'd get injured, which would mess up his chances in future matches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite his pride, Pero knew this was the smartest move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!" Tyson sheathed his spear and shot Pero a disdainful look. "Congratulations. You've managed to force me to use 70% of my strength. Not too shabby! You might even snag a top-five spot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he cockily shifted his gaze towards the Azure Haven Academy team and locked eyes with Leroy and Marreese.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two are the ones I'm really after! I'll knock you out and claim the championship for Fantasia Isle!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leroy remained impassive, her face as cold and unyielding as granite, not bothering to respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marreese, however, let out a derisive scoff. "What a load of nonsense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, he turned away, feigning indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next up&mdash;Jamar from the Mystic Sirius Sect takes on Marreese from the Azure Haven Academy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, shock etched across Jamar's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never expected to square off against Marreese so soon&mdash;the reigning champion from the last city duel. Marreese's skills were the stuff of legends, far exceeding those of even Tyson and Pero.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing he didn't stand a chance, Jamar gulped hard and spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was steady, but resignation seeped through. "I'm conceding this match."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laughter exploded from the audience, reverberating throughout the arena.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha! The Mystic Sirius Sect's third-ranked contestant gives up without even throwing a punch! How pathetic!" someone jeered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others chimed in, some pointing and guffawing, "The Mystic Sirius Sect is a laughingstock! The first quitter has emerged. Who's going to be next?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marreese is invincible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd chanted, already relishing Jamar's downfall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jamar's face flushed with humiliation, and his fists balled up tightly. Among the onlookers were numerous disciples from the Mystic Sirius Sect, who felt the sharp pang of shame and wished they could vanish into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was no turning back the wheel of the matches now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next up, we've got Osborne from the Mystic Sirius Sect facing off against..."</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
