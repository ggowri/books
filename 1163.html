  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity&mdash;it's mine now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't shake the feeling that luck was on his side. This Cosmic Treasure was leagues beyond any ordinary divine artifact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine artifacts were categorized into tiers: Ordinary, Premium, Top-Grade, and the rarest of all&mdash;Ultimate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Top-grade divine artifacts were already quite scarce, each with a significant legacy. In the Age of Gods, even the average deity wouldn't have the privilege to wield one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Ultimate divine artifacts?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the most powerful deities could claim them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But above Ultimate artifacts lay something even more formidable: Cosmic Treasures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While divine artifacts were crafted by deities, Cosmic Treasures were born from the very fabric of the universe, possessing unimaginable power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a Deity King might not be worthy of such a treasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity before him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't just any plant; it was said that its seeds existed long before the Big Bang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the universe erupted into existence, it sprouted and grew for billions of years, eventually becoming what it was now&mdash;eternally preserved in its current form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after countless eons, when the universe itself might crumble, it would remain unchanged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its most astounding trait? Immortality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No force could destroy it, and no power could obliterate it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Osborne could somehow transplant it into his own body, he could achieve the same immortality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's mine now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath, forcing himself to calm down. He knew that transplanting the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity into his body wouldn't be a walk in the park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't quite understand how he knew all this, but a nagging feeling told him that the process would be perilous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, Osborne had the Blood Cross on his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Blood Cross was a derivative of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, and after being fused with his body for so long, it had left an imprint of its essence within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, the incredible recovery abilities Osborne possessed were a direct result of that essence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, while the transplant would be dangerous, he had a fighting chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If anyone else were to attempt it, they'd likely meet a grim fate&mdash;exploding from the sheer force of the Lotus' power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That power was terrifying, even more so than that wielded by a Deity King.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it wouldn't just explode without warning, if even a fraction of that energy escaped during the transplant, it could obliterate a planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If his body wasn't a good fit, the Lotus would resist, and the slightest slip could mean disaster for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a Deity King wouldn't dare force a Cosmic Treasure into his own body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To do so would spell the demise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Still, I think I can pull this off! The Blood Cross is already integrated with me; my body should resonate well with the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity. It shouldn't fight back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's breath quickened as determination surged within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a Cosmic Treasure, and now that he had the chance to claim it, how could he not at least try?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if it meant risking his life, he had to go for it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne wasn't naive; he prepared for the worst. He quickly scribbled a will, just in case he didn't make it out alive. He didn't want anyone rushing in to save him and putting themselves in danger if things went south.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mental strength disturbance was undeniably a manifestation of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity's power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the gods themselves couldn't withstand its proximity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Any attempt to rescue Osborne would only end in their death&mdash;a grim certainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this in mind, Osborne penned his will, setting it to auto-send to all his loved ones should he not cancel it within two days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with resolute determination, he set forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity! The gift of immortality! Here I come!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne trod cautiously toward the Lotus, each step a tentative probe, an exploration of whether the Lotus would repel him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it did, he'd turn tail without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For all its allure, the Lotus couldn't outweigh his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it shunned him, transplanting it would be a death sentence&mdash;an absolute dead end, which Osborne, a pragmatist, refused to pursue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His audacity to try stemmed from a high likelihood of success!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gamble had paid off. As anticipated, the Lotus remained indifferent to his approach. He reached its side, and still, it did nothing to resist him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another might have been repelled instantly, but not Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can do this," he said, buoyed by newfound confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne inhaled deeply, preparing for the critical transplant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, a chill ran down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A voice, icy and forbidding, rang in his mind. "You think you can transplant the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity? You're asking for death!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
