  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's words made Brenda's face even paler, her body trembling violently.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her face was filled with panic and fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the rewards above Osborne's head, though not yet precisely calculated, it was already certain that Osborne was undoubtedly the champion. As expected, she was pushed out of the top three by Osborne, Leroy, and Clara.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to the bet, she had already lost.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But she couldn't accept this result.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She gritted her teeth and angrily said, "This is unfair! All these Ice Beetles of yours are naturally dead corpses! They weren't obtained by your own strength at all! This isn't fair, this zone duel is completely unfair! I'm the champion! In terms of strength, I'm the strongest among everyone! You just got lucky, that's all, this is unfair! I don't accept these results!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda was a bit frantic at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne couldn't even be bothered to argue. In fact, a significant portion of his gains was earned through his own strength. Although naturally dead Ice Beetle corpses made up the majority, even the rest of his gains far exceeded Brenda's by many times.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In such a situation, what right does Brenda have to call it unfair?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What's more, the rules were set long ago!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Saying it's unfair now is a bit too late.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn&rsquo;t want to argue or get entangled with the frantic Brenda. He just glanced at Ian, signaling him to handle it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian immediately understood and sternly scolded, "Brenda, shut up! The rules of the zone duel were set long ago, and you have no right to call it unfair! If you really want to talk about unfairness... you're using a Legendary Sacred Artifact that no other contestant has. Is that fair?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Are you denying me by calling it unfair and refusing to acknowledge the results of the zone duel?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian finished speaking and looked coldly at Brenda.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda trembled, sensing Ian's anger once again. She realized she had misspoken, but the thought of losing the Ice Scepter due to the bet was something she couldn't accept.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, she bit her lip, wearing a defiant expression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian didn't care whether she accepted it or not. He said coldly, "Brenda, you've lost the bet. As a witness, I now demand you hand over the Ice Scepter to Osborne immediately! Right now!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda panicked upon hearing this and hurriedly said, "No! I can't do that! The Ice Scepter is only temporarily lent to me by my master. If I can't win the championship, the Ice Scepter won't belong to me. I absolutely can't lose it, or my master will..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hmph!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Brenda could finish, Ian interrupted her with a cold snort and said icily, "Brenda, saying all this now is useless! I don't care whether the Ice Scepter truly belongs to you or not. The fact is, you used the Ice Scepter to make a bet with Osborne, and if you lose, you must hand it over! If you're not convinced, have your master come to me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Ian finished speaking, Brenda was completely stunned, her eyes filled with fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll give you ten seconds! If you don't hand over the Ice Scepter willingly after ten seconds, as a witness... I don't mind taking it by force! If I accidentally hurt you, or even leave some hidden injury that stops you from advancing in this cultivation level, don't blame me..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Ian let out a cold laugh and began counting down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda's face turned extremely pale and panicked. She looked around, hoping someone would step up and speak for her, but unfortunately, no one did!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those who previously surrounded her, constantly flattering and pleasing her, now kept their distance, as if drawing a clear line, fearing she might cling to them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The situation is now very clear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda lost, and she lost completely. Ian demanding her to fulfill the bet is very normal and reasonable, after all, Ian is the witness of the bet...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What's more, even if it were unreasonable, they wouldn't dare side with Brenda and oppose Ian.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They don't want to die.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Between Brenda and Ian, a member of the Royal Family, they know how to choose.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ten!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Nine!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Eight!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian coldly counted down, each number like a deathly curse, making Brenda's face grow even paler. She was furious, unwilling, but completely helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She could clearly feel the intense killing intent emanating from Ian.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew that if she didn&rsquo;t honor the bet, Ian would undoubtedly strike without hesitation, seize her Ice Scepter, and even take the opportunity to seriously injure her, possibly leaving her with irreparable hidden wounds, completely destroying her potential and her future.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, she would truly be finished!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brenda wasn&rsquo;t stupid. She clearly understood that the reason Skyearth Dominion valued her was because of her talent and potential. If both were destroyed, she would be worthless, and Skyearth Dominion would abandon her without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as her talent and potential remained...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even if she lost the Ice Scepter now, Skyearth Dominion wouldn&rsquo;t punish her too harshly. Instead, they would find a way to help her get the Ice Scepter back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Brenda made a decision.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She glared coldly at Osborne and gritted her teeth, saying, "Osborne, you&rsquo;ve won! But don&rsquo;t get too cocky too soon! The only reason you beat me is because you got lucky and found the Ice Beetle&rsquo;s natural death burial site!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"In terms of strength, you're no match for me! I am the true champion of this zone duel! I am the recognized number one under the Empyrean Sacredness of Eastern Zone 3!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ice Scepter, you keep it for me temporarily!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"One day, I will personally take back the Ice Scepter! I&rsquo;ll even make you kneel before me and willingly return it to me!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking coldly, Brenda still took out the Ice Scepter, glanced at it reluctantly, and finally threw it to Osborne from a distance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne smiled faintly and caught it effortlessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ice Scepter, got it!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is a Legendary Sacred Artifact. Among all of Osborne's Sacred Artifacts, only the Ascending Sacred Sanctum surpasses the Ice Scepter in rank. However, the Ascending Sacred Sanctum is severely damaged, and in terms of power, it might not even match the Ice Scepter.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ice Scepter, even among Legendary Sacred Artifacts, is considered a masterpiece.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Value: at least several billion Sacred Crystals.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At an auction, fetching a price of tens of billions of Sacred Crystals would be perfectly normal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is a great treasure!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne looked down at the Ice Scepter, completely ignoring Brenda's threatening words as if he hadn't heard them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Ian saw Brenda fulfill the bet and didn&rsquo;t make things difficult for her anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Norton, let's tally Osborne's results together!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's gains were truly immense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sky was filled with various resources and treasures, even warriors like Ian and Gerald felt shocked and couldn't help but feel a tinge of jealousy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had to work together to finish the tally faster.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, even Osborne himself had no idea how many Kingdom Duel Scorepoints these resources could be exchanged for. After all, there were too many and they were too chaotic, and he couldn't be bothered to spend time calculating.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And now, even he was curious about what his final score would be.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Should be enough to exchange for what I want in the Glorious Divine Kingdom's treasury, right?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
