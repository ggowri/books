  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Clara's words, the crowd suddenly fell silent for a moment, then bursts of laughter erupted.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man laughed and said, "What did she just say? She said she will take first place in Group Nine? Is she crazy? Does she think she can defeat Princess Yvonne and snatch first place from her?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A woman sneered and said, "She's </span><span>completely crazy</span><span>. </span><span>I almost</span><span> think she's ranked first on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, not dead last."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, Clara</span><span> remained unfazed by </span><span>the crowd's laughte</span><span>r</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Every time</span><span> she re</span><span>called</span><span> what Osborne had said to her, she felt no fear, only courage. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I am stronger than Yvonne now. Others mock me because they are foolish. I will prove them wrong with my strength later.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Yvonne snorted coldly and said disdainfully, "You want to take first place from me? Do you </span><span>have what it takes</span><span>? You're ranked last on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings. I don't even want to</span><span> waste my time</span><span> you because it would </span><span>bring me down to your level</span><span>."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she looked at the other nine contestants and said, "If any of you can defeat her </span><span>a</span><span>nd knock her off the stage, I'll defeat the others and let </span><span>that person</span><span> take second place."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne's words excited the other nine people.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next second, someone quickly attacked Clara, shouting, "I'm </span><span>taking</span><span> you</span><span> down</span><span>. Second place is mine!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This person was extremely excited, and a powerful attack instantly enveloped Clara. </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In his view, there was a huge gap in strength between him and</span><span> </span><span>Clara, ranked last on the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings. He believed this </span><span>single </span><span>move was enough to defeat Clara.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the others were all very annoyed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They reacted slowly and were a step behind, so they had to give up. After all, the rules of the brawl prohibited them from teaming up to attack the same person.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it! I was beaten to it," a man said angrily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, facing the attack, Clara was incredibly calm. If it were her in the past, facing such a powerful attack, she could only defend with all her might, hoping to hold out as long as possible</span><span>. It </span><span>would have been absolutely impossible</span><span> to </span><span>defeat the opponent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now, Clara stared at the attack and couldn't help but sneer, because it was too weak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, perhaps because that person </span><span>launched the attack</span><span> in such a hurry, the move was full of flaws.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Someone like this wants to defeat me?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, Clara moved. A pitch-black iron chain appeared in her hand, a Legendary Sacred Artifact, one of the three Legendary Sacred Artifacts Osborne had given her, and </span><span>also </span><span>her favorite.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She originally couldn't wield a Legendary Sacred Artifact. However, thanks to the Legendary Dragon Elixir</span><span>, which</span><span> put her into the Enlightenment State repeatedly, her strength had greatly increased, and she had gained a deeper understanding of both the universe and herself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under such circumstances, her affinity with this Legendary Sacred Artifact reached a very high level</span><span> rapidly</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, she could fully unleash the complete power of this Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Broke it!" Clara snapped coldly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instantly, the Legendary Sacred Artifact chain came alive, striking like a venomous snake and hitting the weak point of the opponent's attack. After effortlessly shattering the attack, it swiftly struck the opponent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, her opponent still wore an excited and thrilled expression, dreaming of easily securing second place in the group. However, he suddenly realized the pitch-black chain had pierced through his attack and struck his body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A terrifying power erupted instantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a loud bang, he spat blood wildly, his body was sent flying and then crashed heavily below the arena.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara defeated him with just one move.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After defeating her opponent, the pitch-black chain quickly returned to Clara, coiling around her in circles, as agile as a serpent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Staring at the person below the arena, Clara said disdainfully, "You're so weak." Then, she turned her gaze to the remaining people on the arena, her eyes filled with fighting spirit.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "You want to defeat me? Come on!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, those people were all bewildered. No one expected Clara, ranked last in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, not only to </span><span>survive</span><span> her opponent'</span><span>s attack </span><span>but to defeat </span><span>him </span><span>with a single move.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How is this possible?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, not only were they stunned, but everyone watching the battle on the arena was shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A man said in shock, "That Sacred Artifact of hers is a Legendary Sacred Artifact!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Isn't she ranked last in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings? Yet she can wield a Legendary Sacred Artifact. And she looks so effortless. Her affinity with this Legendary Sacred Artifact has reached an incredibly high level, almost on par with those princes and princesses."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A woman said in confusion, "Isn't she a disciple of a Second-rate Power? How does she own a Legendary Sacred Artifact? That alone is hard to comprehend."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, everyone was utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Those who had been mocking Clara earlier, thinking anyone could easily defeat her, felt as if they had been slapped hard in the face at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The situation turned around too quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One moment ago, everyone thought Clara, ranked last in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel Rankings, would be easily defeated and become a disgrace</span><span>. They were</span><span> even mocking her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the next moment, Clara activated the Legendary Sacred Artifact and defeated her opponent in one move.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Apart from a few princes and princesses, only Mason could activate the Legendary Sacred Artifact.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Mason's control over the Legendary Sacred Artifact was clearly inferior to Clara's.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, Clara </span><span>wa</span><span>sn't </span><span>supposed to be </span><span>ranked last?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara challenge</span><span>d</span><span> Yvonne and sa</span><span>id</span><span> she would take the top spot in Group Nine</span><span>. Was it</span><span> not because she was crazy, but because she truly had that kind of strength?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, even Yvonne's expression changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She </span><span>growled</span><span>, "Very well. It seems I underestimated you. Everyone says you're unqualified to participate in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel </span><span>as you</span><span> rank last, but you</span><span> are</span><span>  indeed </span><span>strong enough to face</span><span> me."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But you</span><span> can</span><span>'</span><span>t defeat</span><span> me, nor </span><span>can you </span><span>tak</span><span>e</span><span> my spot as the group leader. Every other prince and princess has </span><span>taken the first place</span><span>, and I won&rsquo;t be any different. The Royal Family&rsquo;s honor will not be </span><span>tarnished</span><span> on my watch."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, I accept your challenge now. However, before that, let's defeat the others in the way. There are still eight people left here. Let's see who can take down more."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, Yvonne quickly launched an attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She also took out a Legendary Sacred Artifact. It was a massive warblade, looking incredibly menacing compared to her petite figure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the massive warblade in her hands moved like an agile spirit. It unleashed terrifying power, slashing instantly toward the others on the arena.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara's movements were just as swift. The pitch-black chains around her </span><span>w</span><span>hipped through the air</span><span>, crashing fiercely toward the remaining </span><span>c</span><span>ompetitors</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, a deafening roar erupted above the arena. The remaining eight contestants of Group Nine barely had time to react before they were all </span><span>sent flying backward, and collapsed off the stage</span><span>, </span><span>spitting blood wildly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Four of them were defeated by Yvonne's warblade, left with horrifying wounds from which their internal organs spilled out</span><span>. It looked</span><span> utterly terrifying.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other four were defeated by Clara's iron chains.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The</span><span>y</span><span> were</span><span> much better</span><span> by comparison</span><span>, but they looked pale and were already injured.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A</span><span>t this, </span><span>the spectators to gasp in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Yvonne and Clara were already looking at each other, with fierce fighting spirit erupting from them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fight!</span></p><div class="pagination">
