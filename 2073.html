  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's attempt to stop her came too late. Alfreda moved quickly and grabbed him firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gasped in surprise, his instincts telling him to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Alfreda's next words stopped him from running.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She frowned and said, "Osborne, what is this? It's pressing against my backside. Is this your divine artifact? A rod-shaped divine artifact? Why are you hiding a divine artifact in your pants? Put it away, now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stared at Alfreda, who looked completely innocent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It suddenly struck him that she didn't know what it was!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearing his throat, he quickly said, "Alright! Since you're fine, just get off me. Once you do, I can put the divine artifact away."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda didn't think too much about it. After squeezing it a little, she let go, still looking confused. "What kind of divine artifact is this? It's hard and a bit stretchy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rolled his eyes, taking a sharp breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had nearly been crushed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Alfreda was off him, Osborne quickly turned around to avoid her noticing his awkward </span><span>expressions</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long moment, Osborne felt he had regained his composure and turned back to face her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda was staring at his lower body, her face full of confusion. "Where did you hide the divine artifact? Take it out and let me see!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He really couldn't meet Alfreda's request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly changed the subject. "Alfreda, what was going on with you just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda's attention was immediately diverted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about how scared she had been earlier, she blushed slightly. She bit her lip and said, "It's nothing. I was just thinking about some scary stuff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But, when you came, I wasn't </span><span>that </span><span>scared anymore! Holding you, I suddenly felt so much better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled brightly at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Some scary stuff?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but ask, "Alfreda, are you afraid of leaving Elf City? So, did you really get punished? Are you being kicked out of Elf City?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda bit her lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just hearing the words "leave Elf City" made a trace of fear flash across her face. But when she looked at Osborne's face, that fear quickly faded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was strange, even to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at Osborne as if trying to figure out what it was about his face that made her forget her fear so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm? Why are you looking at me like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt awkward. He thought maybe there was something on his face and reflexively touched it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda quickly looked away and shook her head. "Nothing! I wasn't punished or kicked out of Elf City! But yes, I do have to leave for a while."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave for a while?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are you going?" Osborne asked, his curiosity piqued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda pouted, looking at him, and complained, "It's all your fault! You kept encouraging me to form an exploration team to go to Umbra Earth! Now look, I've really been punished to explore Umbra Earth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And I have to find ten Flame Gold Crystals there to give to Monica!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood frozen in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were punished to explore Umbra Earth, and you have to find ten Flame Gold Crystals for Monica?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes lit up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're really going to form an exploration team and head for Umbra Earth?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda, seeing his excitement, couldn't help but pout and nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sigh, I really don't want to go! Just thinking about it gives me a headache! But King Ainsworth is too much. The punishment plans he's come up with just keep getting worse! This one was the only one I could barely accept.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's such a headache!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda looked irritated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But a smile appeared on Osborne's face. He spoke gently, "Alfreda, we're friends, right? With everything that's happened, you have no choice but to go to Umbra Earth. I really don't feel comfortable with you going alone, especially since it's so dangerous. So, as your friend, I think it's only right that I join your exploration team to protect you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said this with a look of righteous determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda looked him up and down, surprised. "You? You want to protect me? You're at Ascension One. How are you supposed to protect someone like me, who's at Ascension Five?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rolled her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You just want to join my exploration team, don't you? Don't go pretending like you're going to protect me! When we get to Umbra Earth, just try not to slow me down, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gave him a look of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a bit helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He argued, "I may be low in rank, but my strength is still considerable. If I went all out, even you wouldn't be able to handle me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha! Osborne, you're too funny! I'm Ascension Five! Do you even know how strong I am? How can you say something like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She grinned. "Alright, alright, I was just teasing you! Since I'm going to Umbra Earth anyway, of course, I'll take you with me! After all, you just said it... we're friends, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cheeks flushed as she spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The real reason she had decided to bring Osborne along wasn't because she saw him as a friend. It was because, with him by her side, she no longer feared the world outside Elf City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plus, she knew how much Osborne wanted to go to Umbra Earth and find treasures to quickly increase his strength, so she decided to grant him his wish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, you're the first member of Alfreda's exploration team! How does it feel, Osborne... aren't you honored?" Alfreda said with a playful smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was ecstatic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda had agreed to let him join!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was finally going to Umbra Earth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nodded, grinning widely. "Of course! Being part of Alfreda's exploration team is an incredible honor! I'm so excited!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, good</span><span> then</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda stood on her tiptoes, patting him on the shoulder, looking at him like a boss who valued her employee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But once we're in Umbra Earth, you better follow my orders! Stay right behind me, don't wander off! Your rank is too low..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused, biting her lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Given your rank, you shouldn't even be able to enter Umbra Earth. Being Ascension One, it's way too dangerous for you. Anything could happen there, and it could cost you your life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, if you don't promise to follow my instructions completely, staying close to me the entire time, then I won't take you with me. I don't want to see you die in there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was touched by her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly nodded. "Okay! I promise I'll follow you and stay right behind you. I won't cause you any trouble, I won't hold you back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alfreda smiled happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's more like it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But just the two of us won't be enough! Tomorrow we'll head to the Combat Arena to recruit talented warriors from the World of Racial Convergence to strengthen my exploration team!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
