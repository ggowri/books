  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne thought to himself, his eyes wide with disbelief, "Such incredible power! That kind of attack far exceeds even the peak of a Deity Overlord warrior!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's way beyond my current capabilities. Right now, I can't kill a peak Deity Overlord in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I faced Angelo head-on, I'd be lucky to escape without serious injuries!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's clear that until I achieve immortality, I'm not cut out for a direct confrontation with Deity King warriors."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought lingering in his mind, Osborne continued to observe the battle unfolding before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Angelo's formidable strength, he struggled to eliminate the entire force of two thousand Deathborns swiftly. His mind control power wasn't quite up to the task of wide-area attacks; he needed to focus his energy to take down those Deity Overlord-level Deathborn effectively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Deathborn surged forward, they began to assault the rest of the team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the members of Angelo's group were no pushovers either. Excluding the ten miners and Calvin, even the weakest among them was at the Deity Overlord level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With over a hundred of them joining forces, their combined might was a force to be reckoned with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, they struck together, creating a breach in the Deathborn ranks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the Deathborn army quickly realized they were outmatched. Recognizing that Angelo's team was not something they could handle, they shifted tactics and began to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo shouted, urgency lacing his voice, "Don't let them get away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're trying to hang back and wait for reinforcements! We need to crush them completely!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that command, the team sprang into action, launching themselves at the retreating Deathborn, determined to wipe them out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But their plan quickly unraveled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with Angelo as a Deity King warrior and a hundred Deity Overlord warriors attacking fiercely, they couldn't stop the Deathborn from escaping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing they were outmatched, the remaining thousand Deathborn seamlessly transformed into their soul forms, merging with the rocks and soil of Divine Peak Nine, making a swift retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo cursed under his breath, frustration evident in his tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it! My mind control power can't reach those Deathborn hiding in the solid rock!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's move! Everyone, pick up the pace!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can't wait for the Deathborn reinforcements to arrive; otherwise, we'll be in serious trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Angelo led the group away at a hurried pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle had abruptly ceased, but the danger was far from over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deathborn army hadn't retreated; instead, they followed closely behind, intent on pursuing Angelo and his team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne rubbed his nose thoughtfully, contemplating the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These Deathborns really know how to make things difficult! It's no wonder Lord Malevolence's Dark Deity Legion has never fully breached any divine peak over the years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with Angelo as a Deity King warrior, backed by over a hundred Deity Overlord warriors, they're struggling against just one city-level Deathborn nest! This really puts into perspective how terrifying the Deathborn are on the divine peaks!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this is just the outskirts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who knows how many city-level Deathborn nests or even Deathborn Kingdoms lie deeper within?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaking his head, Osborne realized the gravity of their predicament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo's team was in serious trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The challenges presented by the city-level Deathborn nests exceeded both Osborne's and Angelo's expectations. Their diverse strengths and weaknesses made it impossible to shake off all the Deathborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The relentless Deathborn were smart enough to keep their distance, just outside of Angelo's two-mile attack range, biding their time for reinforcements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimately, with no other options left, Angelo pulled out the Malevolence Airship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, get aboard the Malevolence Airship!" Angelo commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anxiety washed over the group at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edison asked, his face pale, "Mr. Angelo Royston, are you sure about this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Malevolence Airship makes a lot of noise. If we use it, we might draw the attention of those powerful, mysterious entities!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelo shot him a steely glance. "We're just on the outskirts of Divine Peak Nine. There's no way we'll easily attract the Shadow Terror Fiend. Now follow my orders and get on, fast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we don't hurry, we'll be surrounded by tens of thousands of Deathborn from a city-level nest. I might be able to escape unscathed, but I can't say the same for all of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With urgency radiating from Angelo, the others stopped hesitating and rushed onto the Malevolence Airship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ship was the Ultimate Malevolence Airship, known for its impressive speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once activated, it soared into the sky, leaving the Deathborn army behind, who, seeing they couldn't catch up, began to fall back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Diana, didn't you say we shouldn't use the Malevolence Airship in Divine Peak Nine? I didn't think much of it at the time, thinking the noise would just attract Deathborn. But did Edison just mention it could draw the attentions of powerful entities&mdash;the Shadow Terror Fiend? What's that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the mention of that name, Diana's eyes widened with fear.</span></p><div class="pagination">
