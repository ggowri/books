  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne murmured to himself, but there was no hint of panic in his demeanor; instead, a glimmer of excitement sparked in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Supreme Sovereign's Armor boasts such formidable defenses that it can leave opponents in despair! If even peak Deity Kings struggle to breach it, that means anyone short of superpowers like Lord Malevolence, the Nine Dark Sovereigns, or the Seven Great Deity Kings from the Human Community can face it without fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>I need to get my hands on that armor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While I don't need it for myself, I could give it to Anastasia and Zoe, significantly boosting their strength! Especially Zoe&mdash;her elemental power focuses on soul attacks, and she lacks the means to defend herself in close combat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If I can secure the Supreme Sovereign's Armor for her, she'll be much safer!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne looked at Caesar as if he were a juicy piece of meat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The eight Spatial Clones surrounded Caesar, unleashing a relentless barrage, but they couldn't crack the Supreme Sovereign's Armor. Caesar, however, wasn't just sitting there taking hits; he was fighting back fiercely. With the armor's protection, he channeled all his strength into offense and found an opening, striking down one of the Spatial Clones with a single blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Spatial Clones, after all, had their weaknesses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caesar laughed heartily, feeling a surge of hope at having taken down one of Osborne's clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Theodore, this is futile!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even with the God of Space's signature move&mdash;Spatial Clone&mdash;what can you do against me? Your clones can't hurt me, and I can take them out one by one!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Victory will ultimately be mine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Pride gleamed in Caesar's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne scoffed, saying, "You're celebrating too soon! Play with my clones for now. I'll be back to deal with you later!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Osborne directed the clones to keep Caesar occupied while he turned his attention to another battlefield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Realizing Osborne's intent to eliminate Tristram and the others first, Caesar's expression shifted to alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew that Osborne was on his level and Tristram's team wouldn't stand a chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caesar tried to intervene, but the seven Spatial Clones had him firmly ensnared, leaving him no room to maneuver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it! Tristram! Theodore is coming your way! Be careful! Just hold on for a bit longer! If I can take out these Spatial Clones, I'll be able to help you!" Caesar shouted, his voice echoing with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His warning sent a wave of fear through Tristram and his team, who were currently engaged in battle with Anastasia, Zoe, and others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they saw Osborne bearing down on them, their faces paled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Damn it! Caesar is so unreliable!" they thought, but they kept their mouths shut and quickly adjusted their formation, preparing to defend with everything they had. If they could just hold out until Caesar dealt with the clones, they'd be safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but chuckle at their predicament, "Defense? Do you really think that will work? Unless you have Supreme Sovereign's Armor, you might as well be ready to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anastasia and her companions were holding their own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though Tristram and his group were stronger, they had practiced their coordination and were not falling behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it weren't for the difference in cultivation levels and divine artifacts, they might have already defeated Tristram's team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Take a breather. I'll handle them from here!" Osborne said to Anastasia and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They nodded, relief washing over their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Tristram and his crew are done for!" they all thought, dread creeping into their minds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's gaze locked onto Tristram and his team, and with a casual wave of his hand, he unleashed his devastating move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Eclipse of Eternity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A profound darkness enveloped the arena, shrouding not only Tristram and his team but also Caesar, obscuring everything that transpired within. The entire stage was swiftly consumed by this void, rendering all events invisible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was Osborne's Eclipse Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Inside this Realm, Tristram and his companions lost all sense of perception, panic creeping into their hearts. The only instinct they had left was to unleash their divine power to protect themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They attempted to break free, but without a sense of direction, they found themselves spinning aimlessly within the Eclipse Realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne watched their frantic movements with a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You can all die now! We've held back from killing until now, waiting for more significant prey to appear! And you, the super geniuses of the Paramount Supreme Clan... you are my quarry today! Abyssal Spear!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Osborne whispered the words, a multitude of energy spears materialized before him, radiating an ominous power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Having reached the peak of Level Eight in his dark elemental essence, Osborne could effortlessly conjure countless Abyssal Spears. Osborne paid no mind to Caesar; with the Supreme Sovereign's Armor protecting him, even the Abyssal Spears wouldn't breach that defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Kill!" Osborne commanded, pointing a finger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, a barrage of Abyssal Spears surged toward Tristram and his companions, a deadly storm of dark energy ready to strike.</span></p><div class="pagination">
