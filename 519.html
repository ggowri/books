  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen smiled at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Owen, you must help me teach him a severe lesson! Let him know that he can't afford to cross the people of the Augustine family from Newport City and that he is not that powerful!" Evelynn shouted, covering her swollen face and glaring at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several other people also came back at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all seriously injured, but Osborne did not kill them, so they were still alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared at Owen with admiration, having absolute confidence in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is doomed! Once Owen fights him, he doesn't stand a chance of winning!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone snorted, "He might not be able to handle a single blow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's too arrogant. Now, Owen can defeat him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Owen, teach him a lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Listening to their discussion, Owen calmly waved at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should make the first move. Otherwise, I'm afraid you won't have the chance to act at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised his eyebrows. "Are you so confident? Then, I will take your advice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen was incredibly </span><span>powerful,</span><span> the most formidable opponent Osborne had ever faced in his life. He dared not be careless and unleashed all his strength immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he used Spiral Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne instantly appeared in front of Owen and punched him in the chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen grinned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, Osborne's fist collided with an invisible barrier with a loud bang. The wall was incredibly strong, completely nullifying Osborne's attack and merely generating a massive wave of force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mind control?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Owen activated his Satan's Eye, causing six white stars to flicker in his left eye. The ocular energy transformed into invisible mind control and condensed a wall in front of him that blocked Osborne's attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen smiled, "You have great strength. No wonder they are no match for you. Perhaps most Class A+ masters can't withstand your full-strength punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Unfortunately, such an attack cannot penetrate my defense! Mind control is my primary power. I hope you will not disappoint me and can push me to use more of my abilities by breaking through my mind-control defense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted coldly, "Don't worry. You won't be disappointed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He threw another punch, but this time, he unleashed the Ninefold Tide Crash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His power surged like a wave, splitting into seven separate waves before merging back into one. The amplified force struck Owen's mind-control defense with full impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying boom echoed, and the shockwave from the attack radiated outward, causing Evelynn and the others in the distance to lose their balance, their faces filled with surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy didn't even use his full strength in his attacks against us! If he had used that </span><span>move on us, we might have been dead," Charlie exclaimed in horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn bit her lip, realizing that he was right, but she was still not convinced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She scoffed, "So what if he's strong? Owen is even stronger! With such a powerful attack, he still couldn't break through Owen's mind-control defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's doomed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gazing at Owen with a serious expression, Osborne didn't expect that the Ninefold Tide Crash could not destroy his mind-control defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen waved at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted coldly, "I'll satisfy you! This time, your mind-control defense will be broken, I promise!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he quickly racked his brain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, he was absolutely sure that he could crack Owen's defense and even hurt him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was more than one way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he was currently considering was which method to use.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wondered, "Should I use the </span><span>Point Blank</span><span> Force or the Deadly Force?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The former is better, while the latter can be a trump card."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here comes another punch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Break!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's strength was instantly concentrated to its maximum, forming a mighty energy needle that slammed fiercely into Owen's mind-control wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A crack suddenly rang out, causing Owen to panic. He realized his mind-control defense had been breached. Osborne's power was like a sharp needle, penetrating everything and aiming directly at his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without time to ponder, Owen dodged swiftly and barely avoided the attack, but Osborne's force still tore through his clothes, leaving a tear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced down at it with a dark face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn and the others in the distance were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He actually broke through Owen's mind-control defense! It seemed like the </span><span>Point Blank</span><span> Force. How could he use it? His </span><span>Point Blank</span><span> Force must be at least at a proficiency level!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evelynn was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen was equally shocked. He looked up at Osborne solemnly. "Point Blank Force at proficiency level? To my surprise, I underestimated you significantly! To master the </span><span>Point Blank</span><span> Force, you must have a very powerful mentor, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But do you think you can defeat me just by mastering the </span><span>Point Blank</span><span> Force? You are too naive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I'm going to be more serious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen's ocular energy flashed wildly, and in an instant, a tremendous pressure bore down on Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was mind control, Owen's primary power, and his was far stronger than Osborne's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne felt as if ten mountains were weighing down on him, immobilizing him completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, Owen's Satan's Eye burst into light again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne suddenly became nervous.</span></p><div class="pagination">
