  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a wave of satisfaction wash over him as he reflected on the results of his recent seclusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "With my current strength, taking down an average Superior Deity should be a walk in the park! Even if I can't deliver a one-hit knockout, it won't take much </span><span>effort at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gone are the days when I could only inflict heavy wounds with a sneak attack, all while risking a counterattack myself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Superior Deity doesn't pose a threat to me anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how would I fare against a Transcendent Deity? There's a significant gap in power between Transcendent and Superior Deities. I'm still just an Intermediate Deity, so facing a Transcendent Deity won't be a cakewalk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then again, anything is possible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With my current abilities, even if I can't defeat a Transcendent Deity head-on, I won't shy away from the challenge. If I do encounter one, I can definitely hold my own, maybe even come out on top!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Confidence surged within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne might be labeled as an Intermediate Deity, but anyone who underestimated him based on that would be making a grave mistake. At this moment, even he felt he had become excessively powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Time to break out of this retreat!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of reflection, Osborne prepared to step out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder if anything significant has happened while I've been holed up. The Deschanel Clan and the Pantheon League took a massive hit from me; they shouldn't have the strength to stir up trouble right now. If there were any real issues, Grandpa would have interrupted my retreat long ago to wake me up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne exited the training chamber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he moved, the terrifying energy that had enveloped the space swiftly flowed back into his body, returning to the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Osborne sensed an overwhelming surge of energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? That's some serious energy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His surprise was palpable as he quickly activated Satan's Eye, directing his gaze toward the source of the energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression hardened in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air around him seemed to freeze as an icy, lethal aura emanated from his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saw the God of Star locked in combat with a Transcendent Deity from the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne also spotted Divine Shadow fighting valiantly against two Transcendent Deities from the same clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To make matters worse, he noticed twelve Superior Deities from the Deschanel Clan surrounding Sebastian, Anastasia, Bryce, and others. With over a hundred Junior Deities at their side, they were no match for the twelve Superior Deities. The situation was dire, and they were on the brink of annihilation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Deschanel Clan, you're asking for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Osborne vanished from his spot, propelled by urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, despair hung heavy in the air for Sebastian and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onslaught from the twelve Superior Deities felt like an unbreakable wall, leaving </span><span>them with no means of escape or defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a matter of moments, at least ten members of the Augustine family had already fallen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These individuals were the future pillars of the Augustine family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each loss tore at Sebastian's heart, yet he felt utterly powerless. He wielded Godfather's scepter with all his might, but even that only equated to the strength of an average Superior Deity. Faced with twelve from the Deschanel Clan, he couldn't protect his kin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Sebastian watched one Augustine family member after another succumb to the enemy's relentless attacks, his eyes turned crimson with rage and helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap in power was simply too vast!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star and Divine Shadow were both entangled in their own battles, leaving no hope for immediate rescue. What could they possibly do to survive? If they fell, the Deschanel Clan would undoubtedly hunt down the thousands of Augustine family members left behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's hope Osborne can break free in time and escape..." Sebastian thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the twelve Superior Deities from the Deschanel Clan launched another onslaught, and despair washed over the faces of many Augustine family members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had already been pushed to their limits, and this latest attack would likely seal their fates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when it seemed all hope was lost, Sebastian caught a glimpse of a tall, imposing figure emerging right in front of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The silhouette was unmistakably familiar, standing resolutely between them and the incoming danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a fleeting moment, Sebastian and the others questioned their sanity. Had they conjured an illusion in their final moments?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as they registered Osborne's unmistakable presence and the signature radiance of his divine power, their hearts raced with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was no mirage; it was really Osborne standing firm before them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Sebastian's expression shifted from despair to alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "What is he thinking? Is he really going to face all twelve of those Superior Deities alone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne! Watch out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne! Get out of the way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, run!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic erupted among the group as they scrambled to shout warnings at him. They knew all too well the formidable strength of those twelve Deschanel Clan Deities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only a Transcendent Deity could even hope to withstand their collective assault&mdash; and even then, injury would be a serious risk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were completely in the dark about Osborne's recent breakthrough into Intermediate Deity status, mistakenly believing he was still merely a Junior Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The notion that a Junior Deity could possibly hold off twelve Superior Deities was </span><span>nothing short of insanity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastian and Anastasia felt a surge of dread. "Get out of there, Osborne! It's a death wish!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
