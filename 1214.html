  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wings of the Dark Exotic Beast unfurled like two razor-sharp blades, capable of slicing through concrete buildings with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its tentacles, sprouting from its head like whips, could ensnare a person and snap them in half with terrifying strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what was most unsettling were the six octopus-like appendages beneath its body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These appendages were not just for show; they could unleash a cloud of corrosive black mist. Anyone caught in that fog would quickly dissolve into a puddle of black liquid, a gruesome fate indeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, these octopus-like appendages could strike from various angles, delivering devastating blows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A single smack against the ground could carve out a massive trench.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that's one ugly creature!" Osborne muttered, a frown creasing his brow as he observed the Dark Exotic Beast up close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight made him uneasy. With a flick of his fingers, he unleashed a bolt of divine power that shot forth like a bullet, piercing through the Class S Dark Exotic Beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The creature didn't stand a chance against Osborne's divine might; it exploded in a shower of gore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, the people around him remained oblivious to his involvement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where the hell is the Dark Deity?" Osborne murmured to himself, activating his Satan's Eye in a bid to locate the elusive entity controlling the Beast Tide from the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He scanned the area for miles ahead but found no trace of the Dark Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Strange... no Dark Deity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, isn't the Deschanel family supposed to be the ruler of Hearin City?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isn't it the second Ancient Family of Rosmandi, powerful and mysterious?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So where are their warriors?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's confusion deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he moved through the parallel space, weaving in and out of the battlefield, he overheard snippets of conversation. To his surprise, the defenders against the Beast Tide were comprised of the Ancient Families, wealthy families, and ordinary citizens of Hearin City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The supposed ruler, the Deschanel family, had sent no one to confront the Beast Tide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on here?" Osborne pondered, increasingly perplexed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some speculated that the Deschanel family had deemed the situation hopeless and </span><span>fled the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that idea was absurd to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "The Deschanel family has been a cornerstone of Hearin City for thousands of years. "Their influence is the reason the city has become Rosmandi's financial hub. How could they possibly abandon it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could they even think of fleeing without attempting to defend their territory first?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what's really happening with the Deschanel family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne cast a quick glance at the battlefield. He noticed that the Blood Demon members were gradually gaining control over the Beast Tide, prompting him to head toward the Deschanel Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've got to see what's going on over there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his Satan's Eye locked onto the Deschanel Estate, he sped toward it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he hovered above the estate, Osborne was struck by the eerie emptiness of the manor. Only a few low-ranking servants remained, their demeanor oddly calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is strange. Did the Deschanel family really flee?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, wait! These servants seem too calm! If the Deschanel family had packed up and left, there's no way these folks would just be hanging around, cleaning and tidying up the estate!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, where did the Deschanel family go? Could it be..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without warning, Osborne's gaze shot downward toward the Deschanel Estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The estate, perched on the edge of a rugged coastline, sat amidst a maze of massive boulders. With no sign of the Deschanel family's presence, Osborne suspected they had followed the same playbook as the Augustine family&mdash;building shelters deep underground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Satan's Eye flared to life, pushing its X-ray vision to the limit. With this ability, Osborne could see through six miles of earth beneath the estate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, he found no shelter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Weird, nothing here either?" Osborne muttered under his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But almost immediately, something caught his attention. While there was no shelter directly beneath the estate, he spotted something else&mdash;two tunnels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two pathways snaked deep into the earth, stretching far beyond, all the way down into the ocean's depths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Deschanel family didn't build their shelter right under the estate. They built it beneath the ocean floor, hidden under layers of rock. Let's see if they're really hiding down there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He cranked up the power of his Satan's Eye even further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearin City was under siege by the Beast Tide. Without Osborne and the Blood Demon members stepping in, the city's fall would've been inevitable. Yet, the Deschanel family was sitting this one out, hiding in their shelter instead of helping defend the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't wrap his head around it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided to get to the bottom of it himself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pushing his Satan's Eye to its absolute limit, Osborne finally spotted it&mdash;the </span><span>Deschanel family's shelter. It was three miles away from the estate, buried five miles deep beneath the ocean floor.</span></p><div class="pagination">
