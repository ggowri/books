  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clash between Osborne and the two Class S powerhouses was so intense that it couldn't escape Greyson's notice. However, he hesitated to intervene, fearing it was a trap laid by </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization assassins designed to lure them out for a sneak attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, he realized that it was Osborne himself locked in a fierce battle with two Class S </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization assassins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greyson's face paled instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had faced those two Class S assassins before and had barely survived, leaving him seriously injured. He knew all too well just how formidable they were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Osborne? He was merely a Class AAA.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne surrounded by two Class S </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization assassins? This was a death sentence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greyson's anxiety surged as he hastily gathered the Lambert family's elite to rush to Osborne's aid. He fervently hoped Osborne could hold on just a little longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They made it just in time to witness Osborne delivering a swift kick to each of the two Class S assassins, ending their lives in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire group was stunned into silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greyson stared at Osborne, dumbfounded. If it weren't for the unmistakable Class S aura still emanating from the fallen assassins, he would have thought he was </span><span>hallucinating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, defeating two Class S </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization assassins?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was impossible to him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those weren't just any freshly minted Class S; they were seasoned veterans skilled in stealth and assassination. Their combined might, crushed by Osborne, a mere Class AAA?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Osborne topped the Godson Rankings, this victory was too astounding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne called out with a casual smile, "Mr. Lambert, you're just in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've taken care of all the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization assassins in the vicinity. A total of fifty-three, none survived."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's words left Greyson reeling once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fifty-three </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization assassins, all wiped out by Osborne alone?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The collective gasp of the Lambert family members echoed through the air; each one was struck dumb by the revelation. The Lambert family, nearly a thousand strong, had been besieged by these fifty-three assassins for two days, losing dozens of </span><span>Class</span><span> AA above warriors. They were so terrorized that they dared not step foot outside their own gates, sleeping with one eye open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ultimately, they were driven to the brink, sending out distress signals to the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many had even braced for the possibility of their clan's annihilation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here was Osborne, having arrived less than an hour ago, single-handedly decimating all fifty-three </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization assassins!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It sounded unbelievable, yet the evidence lay around them&mdash;fifty-three assassin corpses, most still frozen in their stealth positions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had no choice but to believe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stared at Osborne as if he were some mythical being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Greyson took a deep breath, his voice laden with gravity. "Now I understand why the former Godfather passed on his title to you at such a young age, Osborne. You truly live up to the name of Godfather."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne chuckled lightly, "You flatter me, Mr. Lambert. I was just lucky."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greyson shook his head with a wry smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "lucky?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If luck could vanquish fifty-three </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization assassins, including two Class S ones, our nearly thousand-strong Lambert family wouldn't have been cornered to such dire straits."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greyson exclaimed, his face etched with seriousness, "Let's go! We need to retreat quickly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've just wiped out this batch of </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization assassins, which means we've made an irrevocable enemy of </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization! Not to mention, even Scarlett is dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization will never let us off the hook! They'll send more, stronger assassins; even Sin and Crimson might come after us!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Godfather, we're ready."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded. "Alright then, let's make our way to the Augustine Estate immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne began to gather the residual blood energy from the surroundings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two Class S </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization assassins, Scarlett and the fifty Class AAA assassins had provided Osborne's Blood Cross with a substantial amount of blood energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Collecting a bit more would allow him to further enhance the power of the Blood Demon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After about ten minutes, all the members of the Lambert family began to evacuate in an orderly manner. For the first time in centuries, they left their secluded abode </span><span>en</span><span> masse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they gazed at the distant abode, each of them clenched their fists tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Greyson wore a pained expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Lambert, don't worry! Once we've wiped out the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization, you can return!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Greyson was taken aback, then gave a wry smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "Wipe out the </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Osborne would dare to say such a thing. The </span><span>Eityreia</span><span> Organization has existed for centuries, always ranking as the top assassin group on Blue Planet. Their strength is terrifying, among the most formidable of all superpowers. Who could possibly eliminate them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Greyson said nothing, merely nodding in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, stay alert!" Osborne warned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pondered, "The journey to the Augustine Estate is over 300 miles, much of it through winding mountain roads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It'll take at least six or seven hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Will the trip be calm?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
