  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain's astonishment was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When I stumbled upon the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, I was already an Intermediate Deity, far stronger than you are now! I attempted to integrate it into my body in much the same way you're doing now. The Lotus, feeling my intentions, erupted in a violent tremor that triggered a cataclysmic earthquake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In fact, within a 300-mile radius, the land flipped upside down, obliterating over a dozen cities and claiming at least a hundred million lives!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yet here you are, causing a quake that barely reaches a tenth of that magnitude! This shows your mastery over power is far superior to mine at the Intermediate Deity level! It's astonishing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't believe you're a true genius!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought your actions would lead to devastation over a thousand miles wide, yet you've only stirred up a minor disturbance within a hundred miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At this rate, the casualty count will barely be a blip."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain's expression shifted to one of regret as he continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, on the other hand, was a bundle of nerves. Cold sweat trickled down his forehead as the weight of Cain's words settled in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never anticipated that a simple transplantation of the Lotus would unleash such intense vibrations, setting off an earthquake of this scale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Cain initially transplanted the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity, causing devastation in cities within a 300-mile radius? Over a hundred million lives lost? Did he actually think I would only extend to a thousand miles?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne trembled with horror as the implications sank in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that kind of destruction were to occur, much of Rosmandi would be reduced to rubble amidst a calamity of unimaginable proportions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the Rosmandi people would be wiped out, and the shockwaves would affect neighboring countries, leading to the deaths of at least a billion more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a chill run down his spine at the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was grateful for his strong control over his own powers, honed under Isa's careful guidance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without that, he couldn't imagine how chaotic things might have gotten&mdash;it could have led to the total destruction of Rosmandi and the senseless deaths of billions, many of whom were dear to him, including family and friends. The mere thought of such a catastrophe was unbearable. Osborne couldn't even begin to fathom living with that guilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gritting his teeth, he focused harder, easing the energy flowing from the Blood Cross and stabilizing the unsettling tremors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amazingly, the roots of the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity began to reveal themselves, and the earthquake around them diminished rather than intensified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This quake won't likely extend beyond the Lostridge Mountains," he thought, breathing a small sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, this area was virtually uninhabited aside from a few Ferocious Beasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain exclaimed, "Well, I'll be! You're really something!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just then wasn't even your limit? Your control is unexpected! Honestly, when I reached the level of a Superior Deity... no, scratch that! Even when I ascended to the Transcendent Deity tier, my control paled in comparison to yours!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've genuinely surprised me. I can see a future where you might just help me take down the God of Night and avenge my past!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain's eyes bore into Osborne, almost shining with ambition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne remained silent, pouring all his focus into managing the energy that enveloped the Lotus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the last of the roots finally emerged from the earth, the ground ceased its violent shaking, and Osborne felt a wave of relief wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, now I can breathe a little easier," he muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a clear path ahead, he gently began guiding the Lotus into his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While he had the chance, curiosity got the better of him. "Cain, earlier you mentioned Intermediate Deity, Superior Deity, and Transcendent Deity. Are these tiers of deity rankings?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm completely in the dark about this stuff. Would you mind breaking it down for me? After all, I'm gearing up to forge my Divine Body and step into the realm of the gods."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain was taken aback upon hearing Osborne's response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't know?" he exclaimed, his voice tinged with incredulity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne shook his head. "Not a clue."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cain pondered for a moment before saying, "Could it be that since Lord Malevolence destroyed Celestara, it never recovered? How many gods are left now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was surprised at the revelation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He mused, "Cain doesn't know? Celestara was completely obliterated! Nearly all the gods were wiped out! Even those who survived are still struggling to recover."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought for a moment before continuing, "I don't know about this Lord Malevolence or Celestara. All I know is that in today's world, gods are incredibly rare, almost non-existent."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?!" Cain's surprise was now complete.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He furrowed his brows deeply. "I can't believe this! When Lord Malevolence attacked, I hid&mdash;I didn't want any part of their squabble! After all, I'm immortal, so who wins or loses is all the same to me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, God of Night found me later, and I assumed the gods had won.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Never mind that now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Point is, you're currently at the peak of a Lesser God. Once you successfully forge your Divine Body, you'll be a true god in no time! But even among gods, there are degrees of power and hierarchy. The gaps between these levels are enormous and almost impossible to bridge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The ranks from lowest to highest are Junior Deity, Intermediate Deity, Superior Deity, and Transcendent Deity..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
