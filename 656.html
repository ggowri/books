  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A loud noise was heard. Osborne punched the Titan's huge fist. His body shook violently, and he felt a terrible force rushing into his body. He vomited blood. And his body went upside down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Titan was not feeling well either. When he collided with Osborne, his face changed. His huge body was actually blown away. He staggered and fell down, rolling several times before he finally stood up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a look of shock on his face. And he raised his huge bloody fist in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke Medusa taunted, "Titan Duke No. 7, now you know what a freak is, right? You are a waste, too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Titan was extremely angry when he heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was just careless! Next, I'll smash him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, the Titan rushed towards Osborne frantically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was not to be outdone. He burst out with strength and launched a crazy attack against the Titan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a huge disparity in size between Osborne and the Titan Duke, just like an adult fighting with a newborn baby. But the baby's strength was not weak at all. And he was even more flexible and faster. Even after being injured, he recovered faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dozens of fierce battles, the Titan's face changed. And the injuries on his body began to increase and become more and more serious. However, Osborne seemed to be getting more and more excited and in better condition as the fight went on. He actually began to suppress the Titan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Titan kept retreating, and was suddenly kicked in the chest by Osborne. His huge body flew out with a bang and fell heavily to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Puff!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Titan spat out blood, and his face turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't beat Osborne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell! What a pervert!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Titan stood up. His face was gloomy. He looked at Osborne as if Osborne were a monster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the Titan had not used his trump card yet and was only using his pure body and strength to fight Osborne, he was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of strength, Osborne was no weaker than him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of defense, Osborne was no weaker than him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And in terms of speed, Osborne was faster and more flexible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In terms of recovery ability, Osborne was also stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Titan Duke thought that this would be an easy battle, but in the end, not only did he fail to crush Osborne, but he also suffered a lot of losses. The Titan was angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Medusa sneered, "Titan Duke No. 7, weren't you boastful just now? Your performance was not as good as mine. At least I was not beaten so badly by him! You are a waste!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Titan's expression became gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glared at Medusa fiercely but could not say anything in rebuttal. Osborne beat him until he vomited blood, and he was embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could only mutter, "Humph, I just don't want to waste my energy and use my trump card on him! Otherwise, I will definitely smash him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke Medusa looked disdainful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, stop arguing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Werewolf Duke No. 9 spoke. His face was full of excitement, and his eyes were full of belligerence as he stared at Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Werewolf transformed into the body of a giant wolf and was now not far from Osborne, pacing back and forth constantly, looking a little anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who were familiar with him know that this was his expression of being eager to fight when he saw his prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Werewolf Duke said, "Is a Class AA warrior really that powerful? I can't wait to fight him too!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You all stand back and let me beat him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, the Werewolf Duke suddenly lowered his upper body, then pounced towards Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His claws swung while he was still in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The five claws were like sharp blades, cutting through the space and quickly slashing towards Osborne's body, trying to cut Osborne's body into pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A round-robin battle? Come on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Osborne threw out another punch. And the martial art aura empowered his fist, which instantly hit the sharp claws and blew them up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at the same time, five tiny scars appeared on Osborne's fist, and blood slowly flowed out. Although it stopped soon, he was indeed injured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne looked surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a powerful attack! It was able to cut through my martial art aura and hurt my fist!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's expression became serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Werewolf Duke was even more surprised. He didn't expect that his sharp claws would only leave small wounds on Osborne's fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's really a freak!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Werewolf Duke became even more excited. He stood up in excitement and waved his claws wildly at Osborne, so fast that only his shadow could be seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne snorted and did not retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because behind him was the villa where Clarissa was in seclusion. In the safe house below the villa, Clarissa was still at the most critical moment of practice.</span></p><div class="pagination">
