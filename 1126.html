  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, the God of Star existed only as a Divine Soul, a formless entity radiating a faint glow. Without a physical form, it was impossible to discern any gender.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even her voice, which resonated through the air as a powerful force, sounded like that of an ancient, authoritative elder&mdash;commanding and imposing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Osborne had always assumed she was a male deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, as he gazed at the naked body that Isa had forged for the God of Star, with </span><span>its alluring curves and graceful form, a wave of embarrassment washed over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Isa broke the silence. "Have you had your fill of the view?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you like it, I can whip up a few more bodies for you. You can play to your heart's content, and I guarantee they can take as much as they can!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly turned away, coughing to mask his discomfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was at a loss for words, thinking, "Only Isa will dare to say something like that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, no! I didn't see anything, and I'm not interested!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, really? Hmph!" Isa huffed, a playful glint in her eye, but she didn't press the issue further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turning her attention back to the God of Star, she continued, "God of Star, I've reformed your body. Now you can start the process of merging with it! Since this is a new Divine Body, you'll need to invest time to fully integrate and regain your peak strength."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star trembled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was her Divine Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Level Three Divine Bone Radiance and Level Three Divine Flesh Radiance fused together, it had become a glorious yellow Level Three Ethereal Glow!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a true Level Three Divine Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, her Divine Body had been nothing more than an ordinary one, with a mere white radiance&mdash;no levels at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with a Level Three Divine Body, if she could fully merge with it, not only would she restore her former strength, but she could surpass it, becoming even more powerful than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Ms. Night!" The God of Star exclaimed again, overflowing with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, her Divine Soul surged forward, rushing into the newly formed Divine Body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the Divine Body sprang to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took her first steps, exhilarated by the sensation of movement, tears of joy streaming down her face as she adapted to her new form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a hint of modesty, the God of Star even spun around in front of Osborne, completely oblivious to the fact that she was still bare, having already been seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's jaw dropped in disbelief, and he quickly averted his gaze, his cheeks burning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's my man! Are you trying to seduce my man?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until Isa spoke that the God of Star snapped back to reality, her excitement giving way to embarrassment. Quickly, she conjured a garment to cover her nakedness, panic etched across her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Night, I swear I didn't mean to! I was just so overwhelmed with joy that I lost myself! Please forgive me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa chuckled, her smile reassuring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was just teasing you! No need to be so flustered. Since I've helped you forge your Divine Body, you can leave now. Take your time to adjust to it. Soon enough, there will be a time when I'll need you to step up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course! Thank you once again, Ms. Night, for reshaping my Divine Body! I swear, whatever you command, I will follow without question, even if it costs me everything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The God of Star bowed deeply before hurrying off, heading to the depths of the dungeon to acclimate to her new form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa turned to Osborne with a playful smile. "So, what do you think? Did you gain anything from this little show?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne sighed, "Honestly, I didn't gain much from all this. Your methods are way too advanced for me to grasp! But I get the sense that forging a Divine Body is all about relentless refinement, like hammering away at metal until it transforms into something extraordinary."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa nodded thoughtfully. "You're partially right, but there's more to it than that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Crafting a Divine Body isn't as straightforward as it seems. Without the right techniques, even with an abundance of star power, it would take ages to succeed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And even then, the Divine Body you'd create would be just a basic one. No matter how much you refine it, without the right skills, you'd just be wasting your time. That kind of body would have a dim Ethereal Glow and limited power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your path is unlike anyone else's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your soul of powers must merge with your body, and your strength hinges on the resilience of that body. While others might get by with a mediocre Divine Body, yours has to be the strongest&mdash;no exceptions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused, her expression turning serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, feeling the gravity of the situation. "Then how do I achieve that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa shook her head slightly. "I can't teach you how to do it. I have plenty of methods for forging Divine Bodies, some of which are incredibly powerful&mdash;capable of creating Level Five, Level Six, or even Level Seven Divine Bodies! But I won't share those with you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because they wouldn't be enough for you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The ultimate techniques for forging a Divine Body are already within your grasp. What you need is the Breath of Celestial."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Isa's eyes flicked to Osborne's right leg, a knowing look in her expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Breath of Celestial has a mysterious origin, and only you can cultivate it. If you use it to forge your Divine Body, I can't even begin to imagine what it might become&mdash;perhaps something beyond a Level Seven Solar Divine Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or even surpassing a Level Eight Galactic Divine Body! There's a chance you could create a Level Nine Cosmic Divine Body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You might even forge an Omnipotent Divine Body!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
