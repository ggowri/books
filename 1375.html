  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mining sector?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miners?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dark Deity overseers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a wave of confusion wash over him, his mind racing to make sense of the words tumbling from their lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't shake the feeling that these two people had rescued him, and despite his bewilderment, he sensed no malice from them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's hesitation, Osborne managed to ask, "Sorry, my head's a bit scrambled right now. I seem to have forgotten a lot. Can you tell me where I am?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's brow furrowed at Osborne's words. "Amnesia?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman's expression shifted from concern to sympathy. "Amnesia? Oh no! He's hurt badly. It must be those vile Dark Deity overseers who did this to him! We can't just kick him out now; he's in no shape to fend for himself. If we send him away, he won't survive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked up at her brother, her eyes pleading for understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man frowned again, torn between concern and practicality. "I get that you want to help him, but we're in a tight spot ourselves! We haven't even mined enough Essence Crystals to meet our quota for the month. How can we afford to take care of him? If we keep him here, we'll have to dig up even more Essence Crystals to pay off the Dark Deity Legion. And what if he's a liability? What if his overseer comes looking for him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sister said, her voice rising with urgency, "But if we don't help him, he'll die! It's just Essence Crystals! We can work harder, sleep less, and we'll make it up! We're all human here, and given how tough things are for us in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, we need to stick together if we want to survive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if the Dark Deity overseers come asking about him?" the man pressed, still unconvinced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They won't care! They see us as nothing more than expendable labor. As long as we bring in the crystals, they won't bother about where we found him or who he is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm still worried..." he began, but she cut him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harry!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their argument unfolded before Osborne, and he listened intently, piecing together fragments of information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It dawned on him that he had indeed landed in the </span><span>Celestara</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the most dominant force governing this region was known as the Ninth Dark Deity Legion, the area extending up to three million miles in all directions was collectively referred to as Zone Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What lay around him was a mining sector, a place rich in Essence Crystals&mdash;these precious stones were vital for enhancing one's power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Essence Crystals were necessary for survival in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, where the air was thick with the scent of death. Absorbing the natural energies from the environment meant inadvertently drawing in that very scent, which could eventually wither one's Divine Body and lead to dire consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, everyone in </span><span>Celestara</span><span>&mdash;humans and Dark Deities alike&mdash;relied on the pure energy found within Essence Crystals to elevate their strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The demand for these crystals was immense, making them the true currency of this harsh world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In </span><span>Celestara</span><span>, humans occupied the lowest rung of society, while the Dark Deities reigned supreme.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Zone Nine, nearly all humans were under the thumb of the Dark Deities. Any resistance was swiftly crushed by the Ninth Dark Deity Legion, with rebels either killed or enslaved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The siblings before him were villagers from a settlement near an Essence Crystal quarry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each month, they were compelled to enter the mines, and based on their numbers and strength, they had to extract a sufficient amount of Essence Crystals to turn over to the Ninth Dark Deity Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Failure to meet their quota meant severe punishment&mdash;sometimes even death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Life for the humans here was a relentless struggle under the iron grip of the Ninth Dark Deity Legion. Every day, they toiled in the pitch-black depths of the mines for over ten hours, scraping together enough Essence Crystals to meet their unforgiving quotas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Failure to do so meant certain punishment, often brutal and swift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I can't argue with you any longer! If you want to keep him here, then so be it." The man </span><span>finally relented,</span><span> his voice heavy with resignation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl's face lit up with joy. She exclaimed, turning to Osborne with a warm smile, "You can stay! Don't worry about a thing. Just focus on healing. We'll make sure to cover your share of the Essence Crystals!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a wave of gratitude wash over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This girl, who didn't even know his name, was willing to help him simply because they shared a common humanity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a kindness he hadn't expected in such a harsh world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He replied earnestly, "Thank you so much! I promise I won't be a burden. Once I'm feeling a bit better, I'll leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, I'm Osborne Augustine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia Rodriguez said, her smile brightening the dim room, "Nice to meet you, Osborne! There's no rush. We're all in this together as humans, after all. You can stay here until you're fully recovered. And I'm Amelia Rodriguez, by the way&mdash;this is my brother, Harry Rodriguez."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne felt a swell of appreciation for their generosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was acutely aware of how little he understood about the world of </span><span>Celestara</span><span>. With his injuries weighing him down, even a Junior Deity could easily dispatch him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne desperately needed a safe haven to regain his strength.</span></p><div class="pagination">
