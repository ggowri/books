  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In three days, I want the leaders of </span><span>Rosmandi's</span><span> superpowers brought before me, pledging their allegiance to the Deschanel Clan," Rachel declared coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet the assembled deities showed no worry; instead, they looked excited, as if eager for the challenge. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Failure wasn't an option. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The so-called superpowers of </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> were nothing more than insects to them. Even the prestigious Augustine family in Newport City, hailed as the top Ancient Family, seemed insignificant by comparison. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were confident that their mere presence would throw the Augustine family into chaos, forcing them to submit quickly to the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph shared their confidence. "Ms. Rachel Deschanel, rest assured," he said. "I </span><span>promise to bring not only </span><span>Rosmandi's</span><span> leaders but also those from a dozen surrounding nations to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes were filled with cold determination. Rachel's icy demeanor softened slightly. "I'll hold you to that promise, Joseph. I'm expecting good news."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, ma'am!" Joseph assured her before turning to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the Deschanel sanctuary fell silent. Everyone but the five most formidable Transcendent Deity warriors had set out to fulfill Rachel's orders. Conquering </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> and the neighboring countries seemed like child's play to them. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The five remained calm, confident that no one on the Blue Planet was worth their effort. Joseph alone could handle any obstacles. If a complication arose beyond Joseph's capabilities, they could quickly intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rachel, meanwhile, focused on the remaining twenty-eight Sanctuary Caskets, frowning deeply. These caskets held the Clan's top echelons&mdash;each powerful enough to surpass a Transcendent Deity, reaching the realms of Celestial Deity or even Deity Overlord. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite this, Rachel couldn't help but worry as she gazed at the caskets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the Transcendent Deities asked, "Ms. Rachel Deschanel, is something wrong? I'm curious. Haven't you reached the Celestial Deity level? Why not stay in the Sanctuary Casket until your full power is restored? Waking early might hinder your return to peak strength."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others nodded in agreement. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike Rachel, they had fully recovered upon awakening. Rachel, though young, had achieved the Celestial Deity rank during the Age of Gods, making her the youngest to do so in the Deschanel Clan and earning her high standing with the clan leader, Terrence. Yet she had awakened early this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rachel snorted dismissively. "Do you think I didn't want to recover my Celestial Deity powers first? It's not a matter of choice&mdash;it's beyond my control."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four looked at her in shock. "What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rachel's expression grew more serious. "This new world has issues. There's something inherently flawed in its laws of nature. After reaching the peak of Transcendent Deity here, I hit a wall&mdash;I couldn't regain any more power. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems this world can only support warriors up to the peak of Transcendent Deity. No matter what level of power you once had, that's as far as you can go here. I woke up early out of necessity, not because I wanted to rule this world. Frankly, it's too small. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if we dominate it, it's meaningless. My real aim is to discover why we can't go beyond the Transcendent Deity level. If we can't figure it out, the remaining twenty-eight elders and even the clan leader won't regain more than that level, and the consequences would be dire."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rachel's words made the others pale. "The world's laws are flawed? Max power only at Transcendent Deity peak? How did this happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are we going to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rachel snorted dismissively. "Why the panic? We find a problem; we solve it. For now, the peak of Transcendent Deity will do. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once our clan rules this world, we'll get to the root of it. But we need to act quickly. Our power recovery gives us an edge now, but if we delay, other major forces will also regain their Transcendent Deity strength. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, ruling this world and uncovering its secrets will be much harder. Let's hope Joseph can manage to control </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> within those three days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Rachel closed her eyes to rest.</span></p><div class="pagination">
