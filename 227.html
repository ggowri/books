  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne swung the Death's Edge, unleashing a powerful burst of yellow sword light aimed straight at Orion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had already cleared the surrounding dimensional rifts, leaving Orion with no escape route. He was left with no choice but to face the attack head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of the level three Devil's Light was terrifying, but Orion was no slouch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a Class B+ metahuman, his power level far exceeded Osborne's. Even with all his cards on the table, Osborne knew he couldn't take Orion down in a matter of moments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless, of course, he pulled a rabbit out of his hat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing this, Osborne didn't waste a second after his initial strike. He waved his hand, and a fierce Wind Tornado erupted around Orion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden appearance of the vortex caught Orion off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he had shattered Osborne's yellow sword light, he found himself enveloped by the swirling winds, unable to react in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Orion didn't panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Assessing the tornado's strength, he smirked, confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've really surprised me! Your powers are quite the spectacle&mdash;truly a sight to behold! But this Wind Tornado? It's weak. You think you can kill me with this? How ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was preparing to break apart the tornado. But then, the ground beneath him cracked open, and a sharp earthen spike shot up, aimed directly at his lower body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell?!" Orion exclaimed, startled not by the spike's power but by the sheer variety of Osborne's powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "How many powers has Osborne displayed so far?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Four? Five?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization left him reeling, but there was no time to dwell on it. He had to abandon his plan to shatter the tornado and focus on defending against the spike&mdash;he had no desire for his lower body to be skewered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this was just the beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had more tricks up his sleeve. With another swift motion, he conjured a massive water sphere that enveloped Orion completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Orion found it hard to breathe, as if he were sinking into quicksand. Every movement felt like wading through molasses, and the swirling Wind Tornado continued to batter him with piercing earth spikes. Orion's expression shifted to one of alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted, frustration creeping into his voice, "Water element power!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, how many powers do you have? It's impossible for someone like you to exist in this world!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne merely chuckled, his eyes glinting with determination. "Why don't you feel what it's like to be electrocuted?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, lightning rained down. With the Wind Tornado, water sphere, and earth spikes all constraining his movements, Orion had nowhere to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lightning struck him squarely, and he felt his body stiffen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being a Class B+ metahuman and having trained extensively in martial arts, he couldn't withstand the onslaught of attacks without showing any reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pain shot through him, leaving him momentarily paralyzed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up with triumph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is it! You're finished, Orion! You've lost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, his blood-red hair began to grow wildly, twisting and curling like vines, rapidly lunging toward Orion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frozen in place, Orion could only watch helplessly as Osborne's blood-red hair approached, wrapping around him like a serpent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Panic surged through him as he felt the tendrils constricting his body, binding him tighter and tighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you really trying to capture me? Dream on! I'll just trigger the Dimensional Collapse, and we'll..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Orion felt a jolt&mdash;a realization struck him like lightning. His power had vanished, leaving him utterly helpless. The massive dimensional rift that had been forming around him abruptly halted in its tracks, dissolving into nothingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! This can't be happening!" Orion roared, disbelief etched across his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne let out a sigh of relief. All his elaborate strategies aimed to momentarily immobilize Orion, preventing him from defending himself or escaping.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he unleashed his hair to bind Orion tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hair was unusual, imbued with a mystical energy that suppressed Orion's powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once trapped, Orion was left powerless and vulnerable. Without his abilities, he was just a physically fit ordinary man&mdash;no match for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Approaching Orion with a cold smirk, Osborne taunted, "Nothing is impossible. You've lost! Orion, you even thought you could force Clarissa to marry you? You've really overstepped!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, it's time for you to go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne raised the Death's Edge to Orion's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Orion, panic-stricken, pleaded, "No, please don't kill me! I won't marry Clarissa! I swear, I won't ever lay another finger on her. Just let me go! For God's sake, let me go! I can pay you whatever you want&mdash;just say the amount!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's disdain was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forgive you for God's sake? Sorry, but that's for Him to decide. I'm just here to send you to meet Him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he thrust his sword forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sharp tip pierced directly into Orion's throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes widened in shock, and crimson blood gushed from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His vitality ebbed away rapidly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
