  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside the sanctum, the magnificent throne was immediately visible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, God of Light was seated on the throne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Osborne and his companions curiously looked inside, God of Light's gaze shifted toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When their eyes met, Osborne was captivated by her breathtaking beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She is stunning... so holy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was Osborne's first thought. Even though beautiful women often surrounded him, and he had long grown accustomed to their presence, God of Light still amazed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her aura of holiness was especially striking, making anyone who met her gaze feel inadequate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, something else caught Osborne's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Above her head, the ethereal image of the Ascension Stairway shimmered&mdash;seven steps in total.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An Ascension Seven Supernal Deity King!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne finally understood the level of power possessed by God of Light, the strongest among the Human Community's warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "It is Ascension Seven!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It is the highest level I have ever encountered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Creation Herald's realm might be even higher, but I have only seen an avatar of the Creator Herald, never the original form. Lord Malevolence's level is undoubtedly beyond this, but I have yet to meet Lord Malevolence in person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, God of Light is the most powerful being I have ever seen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not just any Ascension Seven, either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As one of the Human Community's Seven Great Deity Kings, God of Light is a prodigy with unparalleled talent, capable of effortlessly defeating opponents above her level. Ordinary Ascension Supernal Deity Kings cannot compare to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the leap from Ascension Six to Ascension Seven requires passing the third trial of the Ascension Stairway. Successfully breaking through brings an exponential increase in power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gap between the Ascension Six and Ascension Seven is vast!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne carefully studied God of Light. His gaze was not aggressive. But it was steady without a trace of fear or hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he observed her closely, a strange sense of familiarity began to surface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he had met God of Light before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, God of Light was carefully observing Osborne and the others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings and Hannah Gellar of the Mystic Feather Clan&mdash;I have heard of them long ago. Seeing them in person, I am curious to know if these eight young individuals deserve their reputation as prodigies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze first swept over Anastasia, Zoe, Mila, Diana, and Hannah, and she could not help but feel a bit surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What beautiful girls!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, God of Light seemed to see a reflection of her younger self. A faint smile appeared as she nodded slightly at the young woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her attention then was entirely drawn to Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for Bryce...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light gave him a cursory glance before dismissing him entirely. Her gaze locked onto Osborne, and a look of surprise appeared on her serene face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was too calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes moved naturally over her as though evaluating her with a critical eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light found it odd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "It has been a while since anyone has looked at me like this. Upon meeting me for the first time, many people are either excessively nervous and flustered or filled with awe, unable to meet my gaze directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the leaders of major factions do not dare to look me in the eye, let alone scrutinize me openly. At this moment, even Anastasia, Zoe, and the others seem slightly tense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne's gaze is too composed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It feels like I am not the Human Community's guardian and strongest warrior&mdash;the God of Light&mdash;but just an ordinary woman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This feeling left God of Light puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She might have felt offended or even angry if it had been anyone else. But to her surprise, she did not feel uncomfortable at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued to stare at Osborne, curious to see how long he would keep looking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne furrowed his brow slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why does this feel so familiar? Since I entered this Sanctum of Light, I felt a strange sense of familiarity. The carvings on the door seemed familiar, and now, seeing God of Light, it even more strongly...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Could it be that my memories are jumbled?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne frowned deeply, unable to make sense of the feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He did not notice that God of Light was watching him intently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He is frowning at me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light furrowed her brows as well. "Is he dissatisfied with me? What kind of joke is this? He is staring at me like that, and now he is frowning? Dissatisfied? Did he think I would be different?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is he... spacing out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light let out a soft huff in her mind, her gaze growing sharper and slightly annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others quickly sensed the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia, Zoe, and the rest exchanged uneasy glances, their eyes darting between Osborne and the now sharp-eyed God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Anastasia could not take it anymore and gave Osborne a light nudge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, what are you doing? Your gaze is way too rude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If God of Light gets angry, we are done for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anastasia's voice echoed in Osborne's mind, snapping him out of his daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stopped overthinking and looked back at God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze, which had somehow turned sharp and almost hostile, confused him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I thought, "What did I just do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did I stare at God of Light in a daze?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne decided not to dwell on it. He had not sensed any malice or killing intent from God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearing his throat lightly, he gave her a slight nod as if greeting her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>God of Light was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Everyone else who comes to see her bows respectfully, trembling with fear, worried about making the slightest mistake. But Osborne only nods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This guy has guts!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was not one to get angry over a missed bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What intrigued her was how Osborne seemed to treat her like an ordinary person from the inside out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "This guy... he is either crazy or incredibly confident."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then shifted her gaze away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Jethro and spoke melodious. "So, you are from Demon Slayer? The Human Community's Seven Young Deity Kings? And Hannah Gellar of the Mystic Feather Clan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was as pleasant as it was commanding. As soon as she finished speaking, the others quickly bowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anastasia Augustine greets the esteemed God of Light."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Zoe Augustine greets the esteemed God of Light."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mila greets... "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Osborne nodded once more at God of Light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a calm tone, he said, "I am Osborne Augustine. It is a pleasure to meet you, God of Light."</span></p><div class="pagination">
