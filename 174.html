  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo seemed another person, a terrifying aura bursting from him, like a bloodthirsty beast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He punched across the negotiation table towards Valentin with a fierce blow, and a whistling sound echoed. The large office was swept by a whirlwind, tousling everyone's hair and scraping their cheeks like knives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A fearsome Wind Tornado rose from Apollo's fist, blasting towards Valentin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a Fusion Skill." Donna exclaimed in shock, her face stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fusion Skill, integrating extra energy into martial arts techniques, significantly boosted the power of the moves, but it was not something just anyone could do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To achieve this at such a young age was truly rare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin wasn't afraid. Though his expression grew serious upon feeling Apollo's punch, he didn't flinch. With a cold snort, he threw a punch back at Apollo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clash of fists sounded like a car crash, shaking all items in the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin staggered back three steps, leaning against the wall to stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo also stepped back, but only two steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This exchange gave Apollo a slight edge. He overpowered Valentin in strength, though it didn't hurt him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Apollo dared not underestimate him further.&nbsp;"No wonder you're so brazen. It turned out you've got some chops. But with just that, you're digging your own grave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin shook his hand, coldly saying, "The one digging his grave is you. Don't think you can look down on us just because you fuse extra energy with martial arts. You're nothing. If you want to play, we'll play."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Valentin swung his hand sharply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the sound of countless footsteps filled the air as fully armed Skyefall Security elites appeared, cold gun muzzles aimed at Apollo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, the office walls cracked open, revealing powerful weapons, all targeting Apollo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of these weapons made Apollo both wary and envious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo threatened,&nbsp;"You dare harm me? I'm the heir of the Chevalier family, hurt me, and you're dead. Even if you hide here, you're finished."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin looked at Apollo disdainfully.&nbsp;"Your family is powerful, but so what? To kill me, you'd have to breach Skyefall Security's headquarters."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyefall Security's headquarters could withstand an attack from thousands of professional soldiers for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with the Chevalier family's vast influence, they couldn't muster that many experts to assault Skyefall Security's base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, if Valentin stayed holed up in the headquarters, Apollo really couldn't do anything to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing this, Apollo chose to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine. I've got you marked. Since you've chosen to be enemies with the Chevalier family, be ready for the squeeze. I'll make sure Skyefall Security goes bankrupt and you beg on your knees. Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apollo left without a word to Donna and the others, his face dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna and the others had to follow suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they got in the car, they saw Apollo's convoy leave without waiting for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna shook her head, sighing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't expected things to turn out this way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Skyefall Security would rather offend Apollo than rent out the Class A defense system to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was all Apollo's fault, his arrogance and overconfidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Offering 100 million dollars was practically an insult to Valentin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had Apollo offered a reasonable price, the outcome wouldn't have been like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that meant Osborne had won the bet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna frowned.&nbsp;"I won't stop you from pursuing Clarissa anymore, but I still don't think you stand a chance against Apollo."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smiled,&nbsp;"Apollo? He's just a cocky rich kid who relies on his family's name. He left us in the lurch after being humiliated. Did he show any respect to you or Clarissa? So, I don't feel I'll lose to him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna snorted coldly,&nbsp;"Osborne, you're too confident. Apollo may have lost face, but don't underestimate him just because of that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He can't do it, and neither can you. What makes you think you can win?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Donna ordered to head back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, didn't start the car, calmly saying,&nbsp;"Apollo can't, but I'm not him. It's just a Class A defense system. If Apollo can't close the deal, I'll try."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna looked at him in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you say? You? Can you really close this deal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gave a casual smile. "I can give it a shot, but I'm not sure. I need to know how much you're willing to pay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donna stared at Osborne in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's hesitation, she whispered,&nbsp;"Osborne, don't joke around. Sir Radcliffe and Apollo couldn't close this deal. What makes you think you can?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
