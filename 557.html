  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as Owen finished speaking, the people from the Ransford branch bloodline burst into laughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isaac and Nathan's faces turned extremely grim. They glared at Owen in fury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yulissa bit her lip, her voice filled with anger as she protested loudly, "How can you be so unreasonable? When we thought Osborne was dead, you stood up and said no one could be blamed for his death and that we couldn't hold anyone accountable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But now that it turns out David from the Ransford branch bloodline is the one who's dead, you say it's none of your business and that it's a matter between branch bloodlines?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How can you be so unfair?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yulissa's face was full of anger. It was clear to her that Owen was siding with the Ransford branch bloodline.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You insolent girl, you're out of your mind!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How dare you speak to me like that?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen sneered, suddenly raising his hand and slapping Yulissa hard. Isaac panicked, and he rushed to intervene, but it was too late.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a resounding smack, Isaac was pushed back, and Yulissa took the full force of the slap. Blood immediately trickled from the corner of her mouth, and her cheek swelled red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen sneered, "Insolent girl, how dare you speak such nonsense? As the rightful heir to the Augustine family, I have the authority to teach you a lesson! If you dare speak out of turn again, I'll throw you into the dungeon!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yulissa bit her lip hard, still glaring at Owen with defiance, her eyes full of challenge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Queenie quickly supported Yulissa, her anger flaring as she stared at Owen, her eyes seething with rage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isaac, Nathan, and the others were equally furious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen smirked contemptuously, no longer paying attention to Yulissa. Since she was just an eighteen-year-old girl, as the heir of the Augustine family, Owen didn't feel the need to go overboard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He spoke in a calm tone, "The Branch Bloodline Competition clearly states that intentional killing is forbidden, yet Osborne left David's body in pieces, showing no mercy and clearly harboring murderous intent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When he comes out, the Augustine family will punish him as he deserves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As for whether the Ransford branch bloodline will seek compensation and what that compensation might be, that's not for me to decide. You'll have to resolve it on your own."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The elder of the Ransford branch bloodline sneered as he looked at Isaac and the others, "This matter won't end here. Osborne must pay the price for killing our heir, and Dampston branch bloodline will also pay the price!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isaac gritted his teeth and responded coldly, "However you want to play it, we're ready."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Ransford branch bloodline elder laughed loudly. "Fine, then we'll take our time with it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, he said no more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing the matter settle, for now, the crowd watched Isaac and his group with mocking expressions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Dampston branch bloodline is in trouble now. The Ransford branch bloodline is ranked third, far stronger than the Dampston branch bloodline."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"They've offended the Ransford branch bloodline. Life won't be easy for the Dampston branch bloodline from now on! And judging by Owen's attitude, the Augustine family's main bloodline seems to be siding with Ransford."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In any case, they're in big trouble!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crowd continued to gossip before turning back to watch the screen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Owen, too, focused on the screen. His expression darkened as he watched Osborne in the center.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He hadn't expected Osborne to survive, let alone kill David, who was already a Class AA powerhouse!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Though Owen had never thought much of David, seeing Osborne capable of killing him made Owen feel threatened, and a murderous intent grew in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "I must kill Osborne!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Otherwise, he could become a threat to me. That's something I absolutely cannot allow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Osborne was moving swiftly through the forest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Having dealt with David, his immediate rival, his only remaining opponents would be Sam and Rodney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he could eliminate these two, no one could challenge him for the Heir's Emblem, and he would become the rightful heir to the Augustine family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Osborne knew that eliminating Sam and Rodney would be no easy task.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Both of them were Class AA powerhouses, even stronger than David. Plus, they had many supporters with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rodney had fifty-five helpers, while Sam had thirty-eight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne was alone. Trying to eliminate Rodney and Sam with so many people protecting them was almost an impossible task. While he was confident, he didn't make his confidence blind him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What should I do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne quickly pondered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Maybe I should just observe for now. I have spatial power, so they should be worried! If they can't find a way to limit my spatial power, I can avoid them. That way, when time runs out, I'll still be the victor."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With this in mind, Osborne activated Satan's Eye, scanning the distance to observe Sam and Rodney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, they had already come across the scattered remains.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their first reaction was that Osborne must have been killed by David.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wait, no!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, Sam realized something was off. He said seriously, "David specializes in assassination. The enemies he kills wouldn't end up as a pile of flesh! This kind of damage is clearly caused by someone with immense power!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This isn't Osborne's body. It's David's!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sam's face turned grim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His words shocked everyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is David's body?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne killed David?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone's expressions turned pale, especially the nineteen from the Ransford branch bloodline. Their faces twisted with rage.</p><div class="pagination">
