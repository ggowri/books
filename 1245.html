  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The negotiations between the Deschanel Clan and the League of Divine Descent&mdash;better known as the Pantheon League&mdash;had come to a complete and utter breakdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne observed the situation with a grim understanding. "This was bound to happen," he thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both the Deschanel Clan and the Pantheon League were driven by their ambitions to dominate this new world. To ordinary folks, the Blue Planet might seem vast, with many never venturing beyond their borders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to the gods, the Blue Planet felt incredibly small.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A world this size couldn't accommodate two dominant forces; there could only be one ruler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both the Deschanel Clan and the Pantheon League were vying for that top spot, eager to defeat one another and even enslave the other. How could they possibly negotiate a peaceful resolution under such circumstances?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the thieves from the Pantheon League who had raided the Deschanel Clan, it hardly mattered anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deschanel Clan had long since stopped caring about that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, the failure of these negotiations was inevitable. The conflict between the Deschanel Clan and the Pantheon League would have to be settled through war; either one side would annihilate the other and claim dominion over the new world, or they would be defeated and enslaved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that command, thirty-six gods from the Deschanel Clan sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they were outnumbered&mdash;only a quarter the size of the Pantheon League&mdash;they were all veterans from the Age of Gods, each one an Intermediate Deity or even a Superior Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other side, the Pantheon League boasted over a hundred gods, with Helios as the only Superior Deity among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest were newly minted Junior Deities, a mix from the Thornberry family and other Divine Families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearly one hundred and fifty Junior Deities was a formidable force, but unfortunately </span><span>for them, they were up against the Deschanel Clan. The moment they clashed, it became clear they were at a disadvantage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battlefield erupted in chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a war involving nearly two hundred gods, a level of intensity and terror that had never been seen before in this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the very beginning, the combat was fierce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine power surged wildly, and attacks rained down like nuclear explosions. The ground shook violently, cracking open as destruction spread across a radius of several dozen miles, obliterating everything in its path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the ordinary members of the Thornberry family could no longer remain calm. They quickly vanished underground, disappearing without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne gazed down at the Thornberry family's domain, his Satan's Eye scanning the depths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, there was nothing down there&mdash;no hidden bunkers or shelters to be found.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if the Thornberry family members had simply vanished into thin air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He murmured, "Just like Helios earlier. He appeared out of nowhere from underground! I had no clue he was there until he showed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the same goes for the over a hundred gods from the Pantheon League!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They hid underground, and my Satan's Eye couldn't detect them at all before they emerged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's something strange about this underground!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne had no time to delve into the mysteries below. His focus was on the war unfolding before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The outcome of this divine clash would not only determine the fate of the Deschanel Clan and the Pantheon League but would also have significant implications for the Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne hoped desperately that neither side would emerge victorious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But from what he could see, the Pantheon League was already on the back foot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph and Helios found themselves locked in a fierce standoff on the battlefield. Both were top-tier Superior Deities, wielding immense power, yet neither was able to gain a clear upper hand. The struggle between them promised to be a long and grueling affair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the situation for the Pantheon League was growing dire. With over a hundred Junior Deities clashing against thirty-five Intermediate and Superior Deities from the Deschanel Clan, the imbalance in power was glaringly obvious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gulf between Junior Deities and Intermediate Deities was vast, and the Deschanel Clan had five Superior Deities in their ranks, not just Joseph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the midst of the chaos, the battlefield echoed with the sounds of destruction. Pantheon League's Junior Deities were being shattered like </span><span>glass,</span><span> their Divine Bodies obliterated by the relentless onslaught of the Deschanel Clan's gods. The cries of the fallen filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne watched the carnage unfold, his brow furrowing in concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there really no backup plan for the Pantheon League?" he muttered to himself, anxiety creeping into his voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't bear the thought of the Deschanel Clan wiping out the Pantheon League so easily. If that happened, the Deschanel Clan would inevitably turn their sights on the other superpowers of the Blue Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the closest superpower to the Deschanel Clan? The Augustine family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With their current strength, the Augustine family stood no chance against the might of the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clenching his jaw, Osborne made a decision. "I can't let the </span><span>Deschanel Clan walk</span><span> away with an easy victory in this war!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that with nearly two hundred gods embroiled in battle, his discreet intervention would likely go unnoticed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Osborne needed to be careful. "Time to blend in," he thought as he began to alter his appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In mere moments, Osborne transformed into the guise of a middle-aged man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His aura and Divine Flame were masked with the Eclipsing Mantra, making it impossible for anyone to detect his presence or discern his true power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With everything in place, Osborne set his sights on an Intermediate Deity from the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me start with you!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
