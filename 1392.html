  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battlefield was unfolding in a way that even Osborne hadn't anticipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those two siblings really have the worst luck!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of all the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>, the lone Intermediate Deity had chosen to target Harry. Perhaps it was because he was the strongest among them, with the highest level of Divine Body and the most vibrant life force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Deathborn's</span><span> primal instinct was to consume him, launching a relentless assault that left Harry struggling and on the brink of panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the real danger lay with Amelia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like Harry, she was a Level Three Divine Body, the only other one present besides him. Her vitality was robust, even surpassing Vance's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, she found herself facing two Junior Deity </span><span>Deathborns</span><span>, while Vance, an Intermediate Deity, was only up against one Junior Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this dire situation, Harry and Amelia were in grave peril, constantly at risk of being overwhelmed by the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>. Meanwhile, Vance and his group were having an easy time, plotting how to quickly dispatch the six Junior Deity </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> before settling in to watch the show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This won't do!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne furrowed his brow. He had intentionally summoned the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> to stir up trouble, hoping to help Harry and Amelia out of their predicament. Instead, he was watching them sink deeper into danger, and he couldn't accept that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What can I do to change this? How can I make these </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> focus on Vance and his crew instead of Harry and Amelia?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he pondered this, a light bulb went off in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course! My Eclipsing Mantra has broken through to Level Three! I can definitely help Harry and Amelia by masking their presence! I'll make them appear as inconspicuous as stones, so the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> won't even want to attack them! This is the solution!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without wasting a moment, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Eclipsing Mantra had been taught to him by Mila, whose true identity was a mystery but undoubtedly impressive; her parents were likely Deity King warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the once-legendary Divine Shadow, who had reached the pinnacle of Deity Overlord, had been Mila's nanny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Eclipsing Mantra, as Divine Shadow explained, was a closely guarded secret passed down by Mila's parents, consisting of five levels. Only those closest to her received any part of the teachings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Divine Shadow had only received the first three levels over hundreds of years, and even then, she had barely grasped Level One.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For her, learning the Eclipsing Mantra was immensely challenging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, however, was different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had effortlessly mastered the first three levels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Level One of the Eclipsing Mantra could conceal all traces of his aura, even masking the Divine Flames above his head, effectively hiding his power from anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second level allowed him to modify and disguise his aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For instance, Osborne could transform the three transparent Divine Flames above him into two red ones or even one blue flame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he wanted to, he could create an illusion of seven Divine Flames to pose as a Deity King warrior just to intimidate others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he had yet to utilize that particular effect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The third level of the Eclipsing Mantra enabled him to conceal and disguise the presence of others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne was focusing on masking Harry and Amelia's auras.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power of the Eclipsing Mantra was silent and undetectable. In an instant, it enveloped Harry and Amelia, completely concealing their presence. Even Harry and Amelia themselves felt no change, blissfully unaware that the danger had just been averted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> rained down attacks on Harry and Amelia, something shocking happened just as Osborne's Eclipsing Mantra shrouded their auras. The creatures, with their blood-red eyes, momentarily displayed a look of confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They suddenly halted, scanning their surroundings in bewilderment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their not-so-bright brains struggled to comprehend how the delicious "prey" they had been hungrily pursuing had just transformed into two utterly uninteresting "stones."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they were surrounded by such stones, so it wasn't anything new.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, their attention snapped towards Vance and his group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The life energy emanating from Vance and his companions was a tempting, lethal lure for the </span><span>Deathborn</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No longer interested in the "stones," they launched themselves at Vance and his companions, intent on bringing them down and devouring their flesh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battlefield erupted in chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Intermediate Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> that had been attacking Harry, along with two Junior Deity </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> and a dozen Class S </span><span>Deathborns</span><span>, abandoned all interest in Harry and Amelia. They acted as if the two were invisible, charging wildly toward Vance and his crew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vance and his companions had just dispatched three Junior Deity </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> and were on the verge of taking out the last few when they suddenly found themselves facing a tidal wave of </span><span>Deathborns</span><span> barreling straight for them. The sight sent panic coursing through their veins, their faces going pale as ghosts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dammit!" Vance cursed under his breath, feeling the ground shake as the Intermediate Deity </span><span>Deathborn</span><span> quickly closed in on him, launching a frenetic assault.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vance, whose power was still below Harry's, was no match for the Intermediate Deity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The brutal onslaught soon left him on the brink of disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help! Someone, please!" he yelled in desperation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his teammates were too busy fending off the remaining </span><span>Deathborns</span><span>, and there was no one to come to his aid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vance could only turn his anxious gaze toward Harry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harry, help me!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
