  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Declan's fury erupted like a thunderstorm, his formidable aura radiating power that filled the room.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the senior elder of the Augustine family, he might not have reached Class S yet, but he was undeniably a top-tier Class AAA warrior. Once a formidable presence on the Godson Rankings, age had pushed him out of the spotlight, but his strength remained unchallenged.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The tension in the air was palpable.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Declan Augustine, stop!" Caleb shouted, desperation lacing his voice.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But it was too late; he could only watch helplessly as Declan's attack surged toward Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne stood his ground, unyielding and calm.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A faint martial art aura flickered around him, then exploded outward like a shockwave.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The force of Declan's attack crashed against him, yet Osborne remained as still as a mountain, unscathed and resolute. The shockwave shattered around him, but he didn't budge an inch like a rock standing firm against the tide.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Declan's eyes widened in disbelief, his confidence shaken as he stared at Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne said with a cold smirk, "Are you trying to teach me a lesson, Mr. Declan Augustine? With just you? It seems you're not quite up to the task."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, Osborne moved.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't unleash overwhelming power; instead, he casually threw a punch that seemed almost effortless. In a heartbeat, his punch was right in front of Declan, who instinctively raised his arms to defend himself.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The impact sent Declan flying across the room, his face draining of color.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Blood surged to his throat, and he fought to swallow it down, shock and humiliation etched across his features as he gazed at Osborne.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne let out a scoff, not bothering to engage further with Declan. He had held back; otherwise, that punch could have seriously injured Declan, if not worse.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, a round of applause broke the tension, echoing through the room.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Osborne, your strength has truly skyrocketed!" Wesson said, stepping in with a smile.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He glanced around at the stunned faces before his gaze landed squarely on Vincent, who lay on the ground, disgraced.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Leave first." Wesson suggested calmly.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Vincent's frustration boiled over. Even his grandfather's intervention couldn't salvage his pride, and now Wesson was asking him to leave.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was clear where Wesson's loyalties lay.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seething, Vincent could only bow respectfully to Wesson before retreating, his heart heavy with resentment.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Wesson Augustine, my grandson..." Declan began, his voice laced with indignation, but Wesson cut him off before he could finish.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson said firmly, "Let's not dwell on trivial matters. Osborne is the first heir of the Augustine family, while Vincent is merely a regular clan member. Osborne's actions are justified. If Vincent makes such a mistake again, I'll handle it myself."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Declan fell silent, taken aback by Wesson's unwavering stance.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He could only bow his head in resignation, feeling the weight of defeat as he stepped aside.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson turned his attention back to Osborne. "Tomorrow is your Honor Quest Ceremony. Are you ready? The Augustine family has hosted six of these ceremonies, and only two individuals have achieved more than fifty consecutive victories. I'm not sure what the Godfather expects from you, but I expect nothing less than fifty wins."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne raised an eyebrow, his expression calm. "I won't let you down, Mr. Wesson Augustine."</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson chuckled, a glimmer of pride in his eyes. "Good to hear! Over the years, I've heard too many dismissive comments about the younger generation of the Augustine family, claims that they're weak. In the past, I wouldn't have dared to argue against those opinions.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But now, if I hear such nonsense again, I won't hesitate to set them straight! The Augustine family has you and Emma, and that's more than enough to prove our worth!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne exchanged a glance with Emma, both of them silent, but the unspoken understanding between them was clear.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"However..." Wesson's expression turned grave as he gritted his teeth. "But we, the Augustine family, are in the most perilous situation right now! You might not know this, but just ten days ago, the League of Divine Descent came to our doorstep, demanding that we hand over seventy percent of our rare metals mines for them to exploit!</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When we refused, they threatened to ally with the Aberrants to wipe us out!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne, Emma, and Matthew exchanged shocked glances, fury etched on their faces.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Wesson Augustine, did they really say that?" Osborne asked.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson nodded, his voice tinged with indignation. "What they said is bolder and more arrogant! To make matters worse, Marlon, the heir of the Thornberry family, personally attacked me and left me injured!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The news hit Osborne like a ton of bricks.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Marlon hurt you? That means he's got the power to break into the top ten of the Godson Rankings!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Exactly!" Wesson confirmed, his frustration boiling over.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne's anger simmered just beneath the surface.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought, "The League of Divine Descent is not only extorting us but also attacking Mr. Wesson Augustine?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Osborne said coldly, "Mr. Wesson Augustine, don't worry. I'll make them pay for this!"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Make them pay?"</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wesson blinked in surprise and quickly shook his head. "No! With Marlon's strength, you won't even get close to him during the Honor Quest Ceremony.</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What you need to focus on is securing as many victories as possible! Show the superpowers that the young generation of the Augustine family is a force to be reckoned with!"</p><div class="pagination">
