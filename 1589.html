  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt a pang of emotion&mdash;this wasn't the first time Hannah had come to try and talk him out of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before, she'd even gone all the way to the Wild Flame Army camp just to find him, begging him not to go to Divine Peak Nine. She'd offered to use her family's connections to make sure his name didn't end up on the support team list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Osborne had turned her down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And still, Hannah wasn't giving up. She kept coming back, trying to change his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne knew she was genuinely worried about him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he had reasons he couldn't ignore. Only at Divine Peak Nine might he encounter a Deity King-level Deathborn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Only there, with the Wild Flame Army's support, could he hope to take one down, collect the death scent liquid, and let the Primordial Crimson Lotus of Eternity fully recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As long as the Crimson Lotus wasn't fully restored, he couldn't achieve true immortality. And without that, he couldn't free his grandfather, sister, and the others trapped in the Dimensional Microcosm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But these weren't things he could tell Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All he could say was, "Hannah, thanks for worrying about me, but please don't do anything reckless. I'm going to Divine Peak Nine because I want to&mdash;not because someone's forcing me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hannah frowned, her expression full of worry. "Why on earth would you want to go? Everyone else is scared stiff of getting picked. They all know how dangerous Divine Peak Nine is&mdash;one wrong move, and you're gone! Why can't you just listen to me? Why did you have to volunteer?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Today, if you don't give me a reason, I'm not letting you go. Even if you end up hating me, I'll use the Gellar family's influence to pull you off that list!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She pouted, clearly trying to make a stand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But her cute little expression made it impossible for Osborne to be mad at her. Behind him, Betty saw it all play out, sighed softly, and slipped away to give them some privacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was at a bit of a loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He knew Hannah well enough to understand her personality&mdash;if he didn't give her a reason today, she really might use her family's influence to stop him from going.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And if that happened, finding another chance to get to Divine Peak Nine would be a major headache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After some thought, Osborne's gaze sharpened a bit, and he spoke earnestly. "Hannah, the reason I need to go to Divine Peak Nine is because it's my chance to make a name for myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You know I'm a centurion in the Wild Flame Army now, but you also know that for members of the Human Community, a centurion is pretty much the ceiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's insanely tough for someone like me to become a leader of ten thousand&mdash;there are so many hurdles in the way. Unless I do something extraordinary, I've got no shot at getting promoted. But I refuse to settle for just being a centurion. I want to be a leader of ten thousand, a major&mdash;maybe even a general one day!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"To everyone else, I'm just a lowly human. If I don't want people to look down on me, I need a higher rank in the Wild Flame Army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's why I have to go to Divine Peak Nine. Only there can I earn the kind of achievements I need to move up the ladder&mdash;so that one day, when I stand beside you, no one will look at me like I don't belong. No one will think I'm not good enough to be your friend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne finished, locking eyes with Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hannah was stunned, her cheeks turning a light shade of pink under his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I... I don't care about your rank."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But I do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne said seriously, "You're a prodigy of the Mystic Feather Clan, the eldest daughter of the Gellar family. Your status is incredibly high. And right now, I'm just a centurion in the Wild Flame Army. If I stand next to you like this, people will point and say I don't deserve to be there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, even if Divine Peak Nine is dangerous, I have to go. But don't worry, I'm not heading there to die&mdash;I've got a knack for staying alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You trust me, don't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After he spoke, Hannah opened her mouth but couldn't come up with any more arguments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She sighed, sounding resigned. "I knew it&mdash;I can't talk you out of this. You're so stubborn. Once you decide something, nobody can change your mind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She pouted, scrunching up her cute little nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From her dimensional pouch, she pulled out an item. "Osborne, this is an Ultimate Malevolence Shield. Take it. If you get into danger, it'll protect you. I wish I could've gotten you a Supreme Malevolence Shield, but even with my status, the best I could get was an Ultimate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Anyway, it should at least keep you safe from a few hits from a peak Deity Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And Osborne, don't you dare refuse it. If you do, I'll be really mad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Hannah forced the Malevolence Shield into Osborne's hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was genuinely moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Ultimate Malevolence Shield was insanely expensive&mdash;costing at least a billion Essence Crystals, even for someone like Hannah. And yet here she was, giving it to him without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hesitated for a moment, then decided to accept it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, Hannah threw herself into his arms, wrapping her arms around his waist in a tight hug.</span></p><div class="pagination">
