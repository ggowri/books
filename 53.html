  <div class="container"><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Background check?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne furrowed his eyebrows. Just as his second test of heirship was nearing completion, Donna unexpectedly requested a background check. He couldn&rsquo;t help but be anxious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Today was the third day of the test of heirship. Failing now, even with a slight delay, would result in his overall test failure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;How to review it?&rdquo; Osborne asked in a deep voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna calmly explained, &ldquo;Osborne, I&rsquo;m not trying to make things hard for you. In fact, everyone undergoes a background check. I can&rsquo;t risk an untrustworthy person becoming Clarissa&rsquo;s bodyguard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;The difference is that the other four people are recommended by major security companies. They have already gone through background checks and are deemed reliable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Due to the lack of prior knowledge about you, I need comprehensive information to ensure that you are not a spy infiltrated by adversaries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;However, your previous act of saving Clarissa&rsquo;s life will be taken into account, simplifying your background check. I just want to ask you a few questions.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne breathed a sigh of relief, knowing that the investigation would conclude swiftly, leaving no timing delays.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Go ahead.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna glanced at Clarissa, who hesitated for a moment before nodding in agreement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna then smiled. &ldquo;I would like to remind you that you must answer the following questions absolutely truthfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Clarissa possesses a superpower that detects whether your statement is true or false. At present, no one can deceive her.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After she finished speaking, Osborne looked at Clarissa in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The superpower to distinguish truth from lies?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa was actually a metahuman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">While lacking offensive or defensive capabilities, this power could prove highly effective when utilized skillfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne couldn&rsquo;t help but be worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Osborne, it&rsquo;s not too late for you to give up now and leave the Radcliffe Manor. Otherwise, if I uncover your ulterior motives, there will be consequences.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna glared at him threateningly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After pondering for a while, Osborne nodded and said, &ldquo;Go ahead. I will answer truthfully as long as it doesn&rsquo;t involve my personal privacy.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that moment, he had no way out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">To Donna&rsquo;s surprise, Osborne actually dared to accept her interrogation. He appeared quite composed, as if he had harbored no evil intentions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I hope you are really upright.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, Donna posed the first question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;First of all, what is your purpose for coming to the Radcliffe Manor?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In an instant, Osborne sensed a penetrating gaze upon him. He turned his head and found Clarissa scrutinizing him intently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, he felt as if she had seen through him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Was this Clarissa&rsquo;s ability?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was taken aback by this sensation, even feeling a slight twitch in his Satan&rsquo;s Eye at that moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He finally believed that Clarissa could really distinguish between truth and lies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After a moment of hesitation, he finally replied honestly, &ldquo;To get close to Ms. Radcliffe and stay by her side.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">These were all the requirements he had to meet for the test of heirship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He didn&rsquo;t lie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His words caused Clarissa&rsquo;s pretty face to flush red and a slight tremble to overtake her immediately, but she swiftly regained composure, returning to her cold expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia and Wesley both opened their mouths wide in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Did Osborne just admit that he had ulterior motives?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Did he confess that he attempted to approach Clarissa and pursue her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wesley was disdainful of him, assuming Osborne&rsquo;s aspirations to be mere wishful thinking with no chance of success.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ophelia&rsquo;s face darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne was her ex-husband anyway. He, however, displeased her by conceding that he had come to the Radcliffe Manor to be near Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Despite acknowledging that Clarissa overshadowed her in every way, including beauty, status, and background, Ophelia couldn&rsquo;t hide her unhappiness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With a straight face, Donna asked coldly, &ldquo;Do you confess to having feelings for Clarissa and intending to pursue her? Don&rsquo;t you realize you are craving for what you are not worthy of?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her voice already carried a tinge of anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Osborne replied calmly. &ldquo;I wish to remain with Ms. Radcliffe, not out of a pursuit of her affections. Although I don&rsquo;t deny that she is stunning and that I like her very much, this is not why I came here.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Frowning, Donna was puzzled. &ldquo;It is contradictory, isn&rsquo;t it? Don&rsquo;t want to chase after Clarissa?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Osborne nodded again. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t considered it yet.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He did have a crush on Clarissa, but he approached her solely to fulfill the test of heirship, never thinking of pursuing her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At least not now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Therefore, he answered very straightforwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Donna looked at Clarissa in surprise. &ldquo;Clarissa, did he lie?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Clarissa&rsquo;s expression was strange.</p><div class="pagination">
