Diana murmured, taking a deep breath to steady herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She continued, "What exactly is a Shadow Terror Fiend? I can't say for sure. I've never seen one myself. In fact, aside from Lord Malevolence, no one has truly laid eyes on a Shadow Terror Fiend&mdash;everyone else who has encountered one is dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even Lord Malevolence was gravely injured by it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The legends about the Shadow Terror Fiend come from those close to him, and it's said that using the Malevolence Airship above Divine Peak could attract its attention."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Shadow Terror Fiend has no physical form, just a terrifying shadow. Even the weakest among them could effortlessly annihilate an Ultimate Malevolence Airship. The powerful defenses of a Supreme Malevolence Airship can barely withstand a few of its attacks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And if you're up against a strong Shadow Terror Fiend? Forget it&mdash;no Supreme Malevolence Airship can survive that! A regular Deity King warrior wouldn't stand a chance and would be obliterated in an instant. To this day, aside from Lord Malevolence, no one has survived an attack from a Shadow Terror Fiend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, there might be one exception&mdash;the God of Night from the Human Community!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rumor has it he also survived an encounter, but he was injured worse than Lord Malevolence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Diana finished speaking, Osborne's eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I knew that Lord Malevolence and the God of Night had been injured on Divine Peak, but I thought they were overwhelmed by the Deathborn army!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So it was the Shadow Terror Fiend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What on earth is that thing? Even top-tier warriors like Lord Malevolence and the God of Night couldn't handle it and ended up severely wounded."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's mind raced, his respect for Divine Peak Nine deepening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't shake the feeling that something unspeakably terrifying lurked within its shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana added, "The Shadow Terror Fiend isn't exclusive to Divine Peak Nine; every divine peak has its own legends about them. It's said that each peak's Shadow Terror Fiend is unique!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because of these tales, explorers of the divine peaks are extremely cautious; unless absolutely necessary, they won't use the Malevolence Airship."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for why using the Malevolence Airship increases the chances of attracting a Shadow Terror Fiend, no one can say for certain. The bottom line is, we should avoid using it unless we have no other choice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, absorbing the weight of her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's keep moving! After Angelo shook off the Deathborn army with the Malevolence Airship, he immediately stowed it away. It seems he's wary of the Shadow Terror Fiend, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Osborne took Diana's hand, and they pressed on, confident that Riley, who was embedded within Angelo's team, would ensure they wouldn't lose their way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, they caught up with Angelo's group, who were taking a much-needed break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the earlier battle had been brief, they had pushed themselves to the limit to dispatch the Deathborn quickly, leaving them drained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a place as perilous as Divine Peak Nine, it was crucial to be at their best, ready for whatever threats might arise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a short rest, Angelo rallied the team to continue their journey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, they approached the vicinity of the second city-level Deathborn nest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After some deliberation, Angelo decided to take a longer route, steering the team from a distance around the nest, which meant they would traverse an entirely unknown area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The unknown held infinite possibilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps this region posed no danger at all, with only a few insignificant village-level or town-level Deathborn nests that wouldn't threaten them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or they might accidentally stumble into another city-level Deathborn nest&mdash;or even the Deathborn Kingdom itself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, Angelo hadn't planned on taking this route, but the previous encounter with the city-level Deathborn left him puzzled about how they had been discovered and pursued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he resolved to play it safe and detour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go! Divine Peak Nine is vast, and not every corner is fraught with danger! Besides, entering an unknown area could lead to unforeseen rewards!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who knows, we might stumble upon the Miracle Elixir or even a massive Celestial Crystal vein, which means we won't need to push deeper!" Angelo encouraged the anxious group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words sparked a glimmer of hope in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The prospect of finding the Miracle Elixir or Celestial Crystals was tantalizing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both were treasures they could only dream of, and only in uncharted territories could they hope to find such riches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Angelo lead the way into the unknown, Osborne rubbed his chin thoughtfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should I stick with them or cut ahead and wait? After all, unknown areas bring unknown dangers; there's no need for me to take that risk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment's contemplation, Osborne shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it, I'll follow along. If there's a chance we actually find the Miracle Elixir, it would be foolish to pass up that opportunity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that resolution, Osborne took Diana's hand and pressed on, determined to stick with the group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as they entered the unfamiliar territory, he felt a sense of heaviness settle over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in his parallel space, he had to remain vigilant; the presence of the Shadow Terror Fiend loomed ominously, a reminder that there could be forces lurking about that might sense his concealed existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before long, they arrived at the foot of a towering mountain.</span></p><div class="pagination">
