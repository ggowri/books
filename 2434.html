  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At first, Osborne was very cautious and alert, ready to flee at any moment. If those Empyrean Sacredness Ice Beetles around him launched an attack, he would turn and leave without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But gradually, he relaxed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because he found that Primordial was right. These Empyrean Sacredness Ice Beetles really wouldn&rsquo;t attack him. They even actively made way for him as he approached.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If those ordinary Ice Beetles blocked Osborne's path and didn&rsquo;t move aside in time, the Empyrean Sacredness Ice Beetles would instantly appear, drive the ordinary Ice Beetles away, and clear the way for him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They showed no hostility toward him, but rather a hint of respect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This surprised Osborne immensely.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He really couldn&rsquo;t understand why this was happening. In the end, he could only attribute it to something inside that wooden structure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial said that the thing inside the wooden structure was a treasure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And it seemed to have some kind of connection and resonance with Osborne.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What could it be?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was incredibly curious at this moment. Unfortunately, Primordial was deliberately creating suspense and unwilling to say directly. After confirming safety, Osborne had no choice but to speed up. Soon, he arrived in front of the wooden structure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He suddenly noticed that the drum-like sound had disappeared, as if it was only meant to lure him over.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He turned to look at Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Primordial, is it really safe?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial nodded confidently. "Don't worry! I'm more than 90% sure! Go ahead boldly. There won't be any problems!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After speaking, he was excited and somewhat expectant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath, ready to go in.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he got closer, he realized that this wooden structure was naturally formed from a large tree, like a tree hollow resembling a house.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Inside, it was pitch black. He couldn't see anything.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't hesitate and stepped directly into the tree hollow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he quickly looked deeper into the tree hollow.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The tree hollow was vast and empty. In the area he could see, there was nothing except for a translucent, unusually shaped war drum!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obviously, the drumming sound Osborne heard earlier came from this war drum.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, what puzzled him was that this war drum was illusory and semi-transparent. He could only faintly see a bit of its outline.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He could see that the war drum was just an ordinary flat round shape, about 16 feet tall, with dense patterns of various insects on its surface.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The drumhead was even more magical, engraved with various intricate patterns. These patterns resembled twisted lines, ultimately connecting to a phantom in the center.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The phantom seemed to be a strangely shaped insect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It had eight legs, six eyes, dozens of wings, a single horn on its head, and extremely sharp mandibles in its mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, Osborne had never seen such an insect before.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He just took one glance at it and felt a sense of pressure. His Satan's Eye even felt a bit sore. He quickly looked away and finally felt relieved.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He asked, "Primordial, what exactly is this?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial frowned and said, "Describe to me what you saw!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was stunned and asked in confusion, "You can't see it yourself? That huge translucent war drum is right there. Can't you see it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial nodded seriously.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, I can't see it! In my eyes, there's nothing here! If you don't believe me, ask Flash if he sees anything!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne was utterly shocked. He quickly communicated with Flash.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a result, Flash couldn't see anything either. In his eyes, there was nothing in the tree hole, just emptiness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for the translucent war drum, even when Osborne pointed it out, they still couldn't see it at all.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne felt fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, stop wasting time! The things here resonate with you, so only you can see them! Quickly describe what you see to me, so I can figure out if it's what I think it is."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne took a deep breath and nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he quickly described the appearance of the war drum to Primordial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The more he spoke, the more excited Primordial became.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Later, Primordial's body couldn't help but tremble. His branch-like hands tightly gripped Osborne's shoulders. Osborne could feel his immense joy and excitement at that moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Osborne could finish, Primordial exclaimed, "That's it! I can't be wrong! It must be it!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Drum of Empress Kira!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's really the Drum of Empress Kira!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No one could have imagined it would be here, at the edge of the universe. Those guys searched for countless millennia in the center of the universe, yet the Drum of Empress Kira is on an unremarkable small resource planet!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial was overjoyed at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne asked in surprise, "Drum of Empress Kira? Is that the name of this war drum? Is it powerful? Is it a Sacred Artifact? Are many people looking for it?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial heard this and gave him a deep look.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Osborne, you're so lucky! This Drum of Empress Kira isn't just a Sacred Artifact; it's something far more advanced. As for its exact level, I don't know either. Probably, no one can say for sure."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You just need to know that its origin is extraordinary. The drumhead of this Drum of Empress Kira is made from the skin of the Bug Clan's most powerful Sovereign Master, Queen Bug, and the drum body is crafted from Queen Bug's bones!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's why it's called Drum of Empress Kira, also known as Drum of Queen Bug!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bug Clan's most powerful Sovereign Master, Queen Bug?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's eyes widened in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Primordial took a deep breath and continued, "I told you before, the current cosmos is ruled by the Spirit Clan! In terms of strength, Spirit Clan ranks first, Beast Clan second, Bug Clan third, and Plant Clan fourth..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But countless millennia ago, this cosmos was ruled by the Bug Clan for a very long time. At that time, the Spirit Clan, Beast Clan, and even the Plant Clan were all suppressed by the Bug Clan!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And this was because the Bug Clan's most powerful Empress, Empress Kira, led them to become the strongest rulers of this cosmos..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Her power is beyond your imagination!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But eventually, the Spirit Clan, Beast Clan, and Plant Clan joined forces to overthrow Empress Kira's rule, driving the Bug Clan from their position as rulers! Numerous Sovereign Masters from the three clans united and finally defeated Empress Kira."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But unfortunately, they couldn't kill her. They could only imprison her! In the end, unable to bear the defeat, Empress Kira took her own life!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"She personally tore off her skin, shattered her bones, and crafted a war drum! This war drum could be considered her incarnation. She easily broke free from imprisonment and vanished into the cosmos."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"For countless years, countless warriors from the Spirit Clan, Beast Clan, and Plant Clan have sought this war drum! It is said that if they obtain it, they can uncover the secret to Empress Kira's immense power."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And this war drum is called the Drum of Empress Kira!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
