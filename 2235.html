  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four women stood together, each radiating an aura of immense power that pressed down on Osborne like a weight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Angela, are these the little prodigies you were talking about? The ones we'll definitely be satisfied with as potential personal disciples?" the leader of the group asked, her voice commanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze swept over Osborne and the others, sending a shiver down Osborne's spine as he felt the intensity of her scrutiny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela interjected with a laugh, "Amber, don't scare them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never lied to you! I've already tested their talents and strength. Each of them can take down my Wooden Golem three levels above their own!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She beamed with pride, finally seizing the opportunity to share Anastasia and the others' impressive feats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take down your Wooden Golem three levels above their own?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that for real?" another woman, Keeley, asked, her eyebrows raised in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course it's real! If you don't believe me, you can have them try again! But honestly, I don't see the need for that. If you doubt my word, feel free to leave, but good luck finding disciples as suitable as these!" Angela replied confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keeley shot Angela a sharp look. "What's your hurry? I never said I didn't believe you. I'm just surprised!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My training period is almost up, and I still haven't found the right personal disciples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't afford to miss this chance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes scanned the group, finally landing on Clarissa, Emma, and Austin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can they also take down your Wooden Golem three levels higher than themselves?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela chuckled. "Not quite. If they could beat my Golem at that level, you wouldn't even get the chance to recruit them! I'd keep them for myself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, Keeley, are you interested in them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keeley nodded. "I'm interested in anyone until I know who my personal disciple will be! But I don't care about their combat skills&mdash;I'm only focused on their potential and talent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a flick of her wrist, a stone archway appeared before her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I only trust the Astral Testing Arch for evaluations!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The silent woman beside her piped up. "You're spot on! The evaluations from the Astral Testing Arch are way more trustworthy than Angela's practical exams. Some folks might be great at taking on challenges, but they lack the inborn talent to break through cultivation barriers. Their future success could be pretty limited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The overall score from the Astral Testing Arch shows real talent and potential. If someone gets a Class S score, I'll be more than happy to take them on as my personal student."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angela nodded in approval. "If Gwen's on board, then let's go with the Astral Testing Arch to make the call!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then turned to Kendra and the others. "You'll all go through the Astral Testing Arch one by one. It'll size up your different skills and give you a final score.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A Class S score means you've got top-notch talent, even on the Racial Convergence Planet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra exchanged looks with the others and then nodded firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay! I'll go first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying that, Kendra stepped forward, striding purposefully towards the Astral Testing Arch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stayed cool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was familiar with the Astral Testing Arch from his time in Elf City. There, the Royal Families of different elf clans used it to recruit warriors for exploration teams. He knew how crucial this moment was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most people who took the test at the Astral Testing Arch usually got a Class D or Class C.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scoring a Class B was already a big deal, and a Class A score meant one had outstanding talent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if someone got a Class S, that made them a real rarity, a prodigy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumor had it that in the whole of Elf City, only about ten people managed a Class S score.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for a Class SS rating, Osborne could only think of Alfreda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he had full faith in Kendra and the others. Their natural abilities were definitely on par with Alfreda's. Even if they didn't reach Class SS, he was sure they'd at least get a Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that would be more than sufficient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra took a deep breath and stepped into the Astral Testing Arch. Right away, a bright light surrounded her as the Arch scanned her from head to toe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few moments later, the total score showed up above the Arch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Class SS!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amber, Keeley, and Gwen were stunned on the spot. A surge of excitement welled up in them as their initial disbelief quickly turned into pure elation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That little girl, I'm taking her as my student!" Amber exclaimed eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keeley frowned and got riled up, saying, "Hold on a sec, Amber! Why do you think you can have her? Have you forgotten she's a fire power specialist? Obviously, I'm the best one to mentor her! She'll be my personal prot&eacute;g&eacute;e!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amber gave Keeley a sidelong look. "I'm the elder here, so I call the shots! Besides, just because she's good at fire power doesn't mean I can't teach her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're being unreasonable!" Keeley retorted, clearly annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gwen interjected, her voice honey-sweet and persuasive, "Don't fight, girls! I'm the youngest. Shouldn't you let me have her? I'd be so thankful if you did..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way!" they both snapped back at the same time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their brows were knitted in annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but shake his head at the ruckus. Not far away, Angela was trying hard not to burst out laughing. She watched as the very practitioners who had doubted her were now bickering over Kendra's future. Their back-and-forth was quite a hoot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when it looked like the tension might boil over into a full-blown fight, Angela decided to step in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, folks! This is an event for the kids. Let's not make a spectacle of ourselves! Besides, this is just the first assessment. There are more to follow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Humph!" Amber snorted. "Fine, but once all these kids are done with their tests, we'll sort this out. Whoever I set my sights </span><span>on,</span><span> you can't steal them from me. If you don't agree, we can settle it with a duel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Keeley and Gwen rolled their eyes but kept quiet, then turned their attention back to the Astral Testing Arch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Hannah was all set.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stepped forward and walked into the Arch, which started its scanning process. Before long, the result popped up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Class SS! Another Class SS?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, the air went dead silent. Amber, Keeley, and Gwen exchanged looks of utter disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scores like these, which signified extraordinary talent and potential, were as rare as hen's teeth on a planet full of warriors and prodigies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And here they were, getting two Class SS scores in a row.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that wasn't all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next up, Diana and Bryce strode up to the Astral Testing Arch, both itching to find out how they'd do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Class SS!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Class SS!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amber, Keeley, and Gwen let out a collective gasp. The idea of four Class SS scores was starting to feel like a crazy dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were completely </span><span>gobsmacked</span><span>, and for a moment, their competitive streaks took a backseat as they tried to wrap their heads around what had just occurred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All three of them turned to Clarissa, Emma, Austin, and Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You guys should give it a shot too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa hesitated for a second. But after a brief pause, she nodded and made her way towards the Astral Testing Arch, determined to uncover her own score.</span></p><div class="pagination">
