        <h1>Chapter 149-2</h1>
        <div><br/>She continued her speech, describing the foundation&#x27;s three major initiatives: a nationwide network of shelters for abuse survivors; legal support for those seeking to escape dangerous relationships; and education programs to help women rebuild their lives.<br/><br/>&quot;Tonight, I&#x27;m proud to announce that the Phoenix Foundation&#x27;s first shelter will open next month right here in New York.&quot; Applause interrupted her. &quot;This facility will offer not just safety, but comprehensive support, from legal aid to job training to trauma counseling.&quot;<br/><br/>As the audience applauded again, Camille&#x27;s gaze swept the room. The feeling of being watched had intensified. Her eyes caught on a server standing near the kitchen doors. Something about her posture seemed off. Too still. Too focused.<br/><br/>Camille faltered slightly, then recovered. &quot;In addition, we are establishing a scholarship program for survivors seeking to continue their education...&quot;<br/><br/>She finished her speech to enthusiastic applause, but her mind was elsewhere. As she returned to her seat, she leaned close to Alexander.<br/><br/>&quot;The server by the kitchen door. Dark hair. Red lipstick. Check her.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander nodded subtly, touching his earpiece to relay the instruction.<br/><br/>Victoria squeezed Camille&#x27;s hand under the table. &quot;Beautifully done,&quot; she whispered. &quot;I&#x27;m proud of you.&quot;<br/><br/>The words, so simple, made Camille&#x27;s eyes sting with unshed tears. How many more times would she hear Victoria say that? How many more moments like this did they have left?<br/><br/>The master of ceremonies returned to introduce Victoria. As she rose to approach the podium, Camille noticed how she gripped the table for support, how carefully she measured each step. But by the time Victoria reached the microphone, she stood tall and commanding, every inch the powerful woman the world knew.<br/><br/>&quot;Twenty years ago,&quot; Victoria began, her voice strong despite her weakened state, &quot;Kane Industries was just a dream. Today, it stands as proof that with vision and determination, anything is possible.&quot;<br/><br/>As Victoria spoke about the company&#x27;s commitment to philanthropy, Camille watched Alexander receive a message through his earpiece. His expression remained neutral, but she saw his posture tighten. Something was wrong.<br/><br/>He slipped back to their table, bending to whisper in Camille&#x27;s ear.<br/><br/>&quot;The server is gone. No one matching that description is on the approved staff list for tonight.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille&#x27;s blood ran cold. &quot;Find her.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander nodded, moving away to coordinate with his security team.<br/><br/>On stage, Victoria continued her speech, unaware of the potential threat. &quot;The Phoenix Foundation represents the future of Kane Industries&#x27; philanthropic efforts. Under Camille&#x27;s leadership, it will transform countless lives...&quot;<br/><br/>Camille tried to focus on Victoria&#x27;s words, but her attention kept returning to the ballroom doors, the kitchen entrance, the service corridors. Where had the mysterious server gone? What was she planning?<br/><br/>And then, as Victoria concluded her speech to thunderous applause, Camille saw her. Not the server this time. A woman in a green evening gown, her dark hair pulled back in an elegant twist, standing near the exit. For a split second, their eyes met across the crowded room.<br/><br/>Rose.<br/><br/>Despite the distance, despite the subtle changes to her appearance, Camille knew her sister instantly. The recognition hit her like a physical blow.<br/><br/>Rose smiled, a small, knowing smile, then turned and disappeared through the exit.<br/><br/>Camille stood, heart pounding. &quot;Alexander!&quot; she called, but he was already moving toward the exit, security personnel following.<br/><br/>Victoria returned to the table, flushed with the success of her speech but clearly exhausted. &quot;What&#x27;s wrong?&quot; she asked, seeing Camille&#x27;s face.<br/><br/>&quot;Rose is here,&quot; Camille said quietly, not wanting to cause panic. &quot;I just saw her.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s expression hardened. &quot;Are you sure?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Positive.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria reached for her clutch purse, removing a small phone. &quot;I had hoped we wouldn&#x27;t need this,&quot; she said, pressing a single button. &quot;But I came prepared.&quot;<br/><br/>Within moments, additional security personnel entered the ballroom, positioning themselves near all exits and around their table. The head of Victoria&#x27;s private security team approached.<br/><br/>&quot;The building is being locked down, Ms. Kane,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;No one leaves until we find her.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille looked around at the guests, still enjoying their drinks and conversation as the orchestra began playing for dancing. &quot;We can&#x27;t cause a panic.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We won&#x27;t,&quot; Victoria assured her. &quot;The security teams will handle this discreetly.&quot;<br/><br/>But Camille couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong. Rose wouldn&#x27;t show herself without a reason. Without a plan.<br/><br/>&quot;She wanted me to see her,&quot; Camille realized aloud. &quot;She wanted me to know she was here.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Why?&quot; Victoria asked.<br/><br/>Before Camille could answer, Alexander returned, his expression grim.<br/><br/>&quot;She&#x27;s gone,&quot; he reported. &quot;Security footage shows her leaving the building two minutes ago. But that&#x27;s not all.&quot; He lowered his voice further. &quot;The missing server was found unconscious in a storage closet. Her uniform is gone.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille scanned the crowd, looking for any staff member who seemed out of place. &quot;She has someone else inside.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;re checking everyone now,&quot; Alexander assured her.<br/><br/>Victoria touched Camille&#x27;s arm. &quot;We should leave. It&#x27;s not safe.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille shook her head. &quot;No. That&#x27;s what she wants. To disrupt the gala. To make us run scared.&quot; She looked at Alexander. &quot;Double the security around Victoria. I&#x27;m going to finish what we started tonight.&quot;<br/><br/>As Alexander moved to comply, Camille took Victoria&#x27;s hand. &quot;I won&#x27;t let her ruin this. Not after everything you&#x27;ve done to make it happen.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria studied Camille&#x27;s face, then nodded slowly. &quot;Very well. But you stay where I can see you. No wandering off.&quot;<br/><br/>The orchestra continued playing, the dance floor filling with elegantly dressed couples. The charity auction was about to begin, with priceless art and luxury experiences up for bid. The gala was in full swing, with hours still to go.<br/><br/>But beneath the glittering surface, tension ran like an electric current. Security personnel moved through the crowd, checking every server, every staff member. Alexander stood at Camille&#x27;s side, hyperaware, watching every movement in the ballroom.<br/><br/>As Victoria presented the first auction item, a week at a private island resort, Camille felt the weight of Rose&#x27;s presence like a shadow. She was here. Maybe not physically anymore, but her threat remained. Waiting. Watching. Planning.<br/><br/>The feeling of danger hung over Camille like a storm cloud, making the hairs on her arms stand on end. Whatever Rose had planned, it was still coming.<br/><br/>The gala continued around them, champagne flowing, music playing, wealthy donors bidding higher and higher amounts for charity. But for Camille, every moment stretched with tension, every laugh seemed too loud, every movement in the corner of her eye a potential threat.<br/><br/>Rose had made her move tonight, not to attack, but to send a message: I can reach you anywhere. Even in your moment of triumph. Even surrounded by security.<br/><br/>And there was nothing Camille could do but wait for the next strike, knowing it would come when they least expected it.<br/></div>
