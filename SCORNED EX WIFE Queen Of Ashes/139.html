        <h1>Chapter 97-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 97<br/><br/>Rain lashed against the windows of Victoria Kane&#x27;s office, matching her dark mood. She sat rigid in her leather chair, eyes fixed on the large screen mounted on the wall. The security footage playing before her sent ice through her veins despite the warmth of the room.<br/><br/>Martin, her head of security, stood nearby, his face grim as they watched Rose Lewis slip into a side entrance of an upscale restaurant. The timestamp showed 9:43 PM, two days ago.<br/><br/>&quot;Pause it,&quot; Victoria commanded.<br/><br/>Martin pressed a button on the remote. The image froze, capturing Rose mid-step, her face partly hidden by large sunglasses despite the late hour. Even in disguise, the hatred Victoria felt for this woman burned in her stomach like acid.<br/><br/>&quot;Continue.&quot;<br/><br/>The footage resumed. Rose moved through the restaurant, head down, until she reached a private dining area in the back. A waiter pulled aside a curtain, revealing a booth where someone already waited. The camera angle only showed the back of a man&#x27;s head, dark hair, broad shoulders in an expensive suit.<br/><br/>&quot;Can you get a better view of his face?&quot; Victoria asked, leaning forward.<br/><br/>Martin shook his head. &quot;No, ma&#x27;am. We&#x27;ve tried enhancing from every angle. The restaurant&#x27;s security system isn&#x27;t positioned to capture that corner clearly. It seems...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Deliberate,&quot; Victoria finished for him. &quot;As if they knew exactly where to sit to avoid identification.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes, ma&#x27;am.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s fingers tapped against the polished wood of her desk, a habit she allowed herself only in moments of deep concern. &quot;What else?&quot;<br/><br/>Martin changed to another video feed. This one showed Rose and the mystery man leaving separately. First Rose, glancing nervously over her shoulder, then twenty minutes later, the man, still with his back to the camera, walking with the straight-backed confidence of someone used to command.<br/><br/>&quot;We followed her?&quot; Victoria asked.<br/><br/>&quot;Yes. She went directly to her apartment.&quot; Martin hesitated. &quot;We tried to track the man, but he had a car waiting. Black Bentley, tinted windows, changed license plates twice before we lost him in Queens.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s eyes narrowed. Amateur mistakes weren&#x27;t made by Martin&#x27;s team. &quot;He knew you were following.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It appears so.&quot; Martin&#x27;s professional pride seemed wounded. &quot;Whoever he is, he has resources. And training.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria stood, moving to the window. Below, New York sprawled out, glistening wet from the rain, lights blurred like watercolors. Somewhere in that vast city, Rose Lewis plotted with an unknown ally. The timing couldn&#x27;t be coincidence, not with the Phoenix Grid groundbreaking ceremony only days away.<br/><br/>&quot;Show me the other encounters,&quot; she ordered, turning back.<br/><br/>Martin pulled up four more video clips, different locations, different days. A coffee shop in Brooklyn. A bench in Central Park. The lobby of a hotel. A dock at the marina. Always the same pattern: Rose and the mystery man, faces hidden or obscured, meeting in locations that seemed random but Victoria recognized as strategically selected for minimal surveillance.<br/><br/>&quot;They&#x27;re planning something,&quot; Victoria murmured, more to herself than to Martin.<br/><br/>&quot;Without question.&quot; Martin pulled out a tablet and handed it to her. &quot;There&#x27;s more. Financial records show Rose has accessed emergency funds we weren&#x27;t aware of. Not much, two hundred thousand dollars, but enough.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria swiped through the banking records, a cold knot forming in her chest. &quot;And the man?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Nothing. No financial trail we can follow. Which suggests someone who knows how to cover his tracks.&quot;<br/><br/>The rain beat harder against the glass. Victoria felt her age today, the weight of it pressing down on her shoulders. She had lived through corporate wars, personal tragedies, and countless attacks on her empire. Her instincts had never failed her, and now they screamed danger.<br/><br/>&quot;Where is Camille now?&quot; she asked.<br/><br/>&quot;At the engineering facility with Ms. Zhao, reviewing the final blueprints for the Grid. Mr. Pierce is with her.&quot;<br/><br/>At least she was safe, Victoria thought. Protected by Alexander&#x27;s presence and his own security team. But for how long?<br/><br/>Victoria moved back to her desk and pressed the intercom. &quot;Sarah, cancel my meetings for the rest of the day. And have the car ready in twenty minutes.&quot;<br/><br/>She released the button and looked at Martin. &quot;I want our security doubled at the groundbreaking ceremony. Triple it around Camille without making it obvious. And I want every second of Rose&#x27;s day tracked, where she goes, who she meets, what she buys.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes, ma&#x27;am.&quot; Martin&#x27;s expression remained neutral, but Victoria caught the faintest flicker of concern in his eyes. &quot;And the man?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Find him,&quot; Victoria said, her voice going sharp as a blade. &quot;Whatever it takes.&quot;<br/><br/>Martin nodded and left the office. Alone, Victoria pulled open her desk drawer and removed an old photograph, herself and Sophia, thirteen years ago, at the hospital fundraiser where Sofia had met Charles Preston.<br/><br/>The ache in her chest surprised her. Victoria Kane did not indulge in regret, it was unproductive, wasteful. Yet lately, watching Camille begin to open her heart to Alexander, seeing glimpses of the woman she had been before Rose&#x27;s betrayal, Victoria wondered about the costs of her methods.<br/><br/>&quot;Necessary,&quot; she whispered to the empty room. Everything had been necessary. The surgery. The training. The calculated revenge. She had forged Camille into a weapon that could strike back at those who had tried to destroy her.<br/><br/>But weapons, once created, didn&#x27;t always stay in the hands that made them.</div>
