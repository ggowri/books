        <h1>Chapter 165-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 165<br/><br/>Cold. That was the first thing Camille felt. Cold and a deep, throbbing pain in her head.<br/><br/>She tried to move, but her arms wouldn&#x27;t respond. Slowly, her eyes opened to a dimly lit room with wooden walls. Her vision swam, the effects of whatever drug Rose had given her still lingering in her system.<br/><br/>Looking down, Camille saw thick rope binding her to a heavy wooden chair. Each wrist tied separately to the armrests, ankles secured to the chair legs. Whoever had tied these knots knew what they were doing.<br/><br/>A wave of fear washed over her, threatening to drown her reason. She forced it down, focusing instead on her surroundings. Wooden walls. A stone fireplace. Large windows showing dense forest outside. And something else, something familiar.<br/><br/>Recognition dawned slowly. She knew this place. Or rather, she knew what it had once been.<br/><br/>The old Lewis family cabin. Where they had spent summers when they were younger. Where they had once been sisters before everything changed.<br/><br/>But this wasn&#x27;t exactly the cabin she remembered. That had been smaller, older. This was a new structure built on the same spot, incorporating elements of the original, the stone fireplace, the position of the windows, but larger, more modern.<br/><br/>&quot;Finally awake, sleeping beauty?&quot; Rose&#x27;s voice came from behind her.<br/><br/>Camille tensed but kept her breathing steady, refusing to show fear as Rose walked around to face her. Her sister looked different than she had at the roadside. She&#x27;d washed out the black hair dye, returning to her natural color. Dressed not in the tactical gear from the ambush but in casual clothes, jeans and a sweater that reminded Camille of what they used to wear during those summer vacations.<br/><br/>&quot;Do you like what I&#x27;ve done with the place?&quot; Rose asked, gesturing around them. &quot;I rebuilt it exactly as I remembered, with a few modern touches. Dad sold it after everything fell apart. After they thought that you died.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille worked moisture into her dry mouth. &quot;Why am I here, Rose?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;So impatient,&quot; Rose chided, pulling up a chair to sit facing Camille. &quot;No appreciation for symmetry. For perfect endings.&quot; She leaned forward, eyes glittering with excitement. &quot;Don&#x27;t you see? This is where we were happiest together. Before you turned everyone against me.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I didn&#x27;t turn anyone against you,&quot; Camille said quietly. &quot;You did that yourself when you tried to kill me.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s face hardened. &quot;Is that what you tell yourself? That I&#x27;m the villain in this story?&quot; She stood abruptly. &quot;They abandoned me. Our parents. Stefan. Everyone chose you and threw me away.&quot;<br/><br/>She paced the room, agitation making her movements sharp and jerky. &quot;But that doesn&#x27;t matter anymore. What matters is that we&#x27;ve come full circle. Back to where we were once happy. Back to where everything changed.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille tested the ropes binding her wrists. No give at all. Rose noticed and smiled.<br/><br/>&quot;Don&#x27;t bother. My men are professionals. Former military. They know how to keep someone secure.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Where are they now?&quot; Camille asked, looking around the empty cabin main room.<br/><br/>&quot;Around,&quot; Rose said vaguely. &quot;Keeping watch. Making sure your boyfriend and his security teams don&#x27;t interrupt our sister time.&quot; She sat down again, leaning uncomfortably close. &quot;We have so much catching up to do.&quot;<br/><br/>Despite the pounding in her head and the fear churning in her stomach, Camille met Rose&#x27;s gaze steadily. &quot;They&#x27;ll find me, Rose. Alexander, Victoria, the FBI, they&#x27;re looking for me right now.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s smile widened. &quot;I&#x27;m counting on it. But they won&#x27;t find you in time.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;In time for what?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;In time to save you?&quot; Rose shrugged. &quot;That depends on how you define &#x27;save.&#x27; Will they find you alive? Probably. Will they find you whole? Unbroken? Now that&#x27;s a different question entirely.&quot;<br/><br/>A chill ran down Camille&#x27;s spine, but she kept her expression neutral. Victoria had taught her well, never show weakness to an opponent. And Rose was nothing if not an opponent now.<br/><br/>&quot;What do you want?&quot; Camille asked again. &quot;You&#x27;ve had months to plan. Weeks to prepare. Now you have me. So what&#x27;s the point of all this?&quot;<br/><br/>Rose stood again, moving to a table where a laptop sat open. &quot;The point? Oh, sister dear, the point is to take everything from you. Just as you took everything from me.&quot; She tapped a few keys on the laptop. &quot;But not all at once. That would be too... merciful.&quot;<br/><br/>The screen lit up, showing a split view of four different camera feeds. Camille recognized them immediately, Victoria&#x27;s lake house. Alexander&#x27;s apartment. Her parents&#x27; home. The Kane Industries building.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ve been watching all of them,&quot; Rose explained, her voice casual, as if discussing the weather. &quot;Planning my next move.&quot;<br/><br/>Horror bloomed in Camille&#x27;s chest. &quot;Rose, don&#x27;t. They&#x27;ve done nothing to you.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Nothing?&quot; Rose&#x27;s voice rose sharply. &quot;Victoria Kane took you in, made you her heir, gave you everything I should have had. Alexander Pierce loves you, protects you, stood by you. Our parents chose you over me, abandoned me when I needed them most. Again and again, they all chose you.&quot;<br/><br/>She moved closer, her face inches from Camille&#x27;s. &quot;And now they&#x27;ll pay for that choice. One by one. While you watch. Unable to warn them. Unable to save them.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille fought to keep her breathing steady, to not show the terror gripping her heart. &quot;Why not just kill me then? Why go after them?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Because death is too quick, too clean,&quot; Rose explained, her tone frighteningly reasonable. &quot;I want you to live, Camille. Live knowing everyone you love died because of you. Live with that pain eating away at you every day, just as I&#x27;ve lived with the knowledge that I was never enough. Never the daughter they wanted. Never the sister you valued.&quot;<br/><br/>Despite her efforts to remain calm, tears burned in Camille&#x27;s eyes. &quot;You&#x27;re wrong, Rose. So wrong about everything. They loved you. I loved you. But you tried to kill me, what did you expect them to do?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I expected loyalty!&quot; Rose shouted. &quot;I expected them to understand that everything I did was because of how they treated me. Always comparing me to perfect Camille. Always making me feel like I didn&#x27;t belong.&quot;</div>
