        <h1>Chapter 43</h1>
        <div><p>Chapter 43<br/><br/>Camille&#x27;s point of view <br/><br/>The Metropolitan Museum sparkled like a jewel box, transformed for the annual Children&#x27;s Hospital Benefit. Diamonds caught light from a thousand candles, champagne flowed in crystal flutes, and the wealthy elite of New York performed their yearly ritual of competitive generosity.<br/><br/>I moved through the crowd in a midnight blue gown, Victoria&#x27;s careful training evident in every step. My hair swept up in an elegant twist, my makeup flawless, my smile measured and controlled. Camille Kane, heiress to a fortune, daughter of power. A woman these people now courted rather than dismissed.<br/><br/>How different from the last charity gala I&#x27;d attended as Camille Lewis. Then, I&#x27;d stood in Rose&#x27;s shadow, wearing a dress she&#x27;d &quot;allowed&quot; me to borrow, watching society ladies air-kiss her cheeks while barely glancing my way.<br/><br/>&quot;Ms. Kane.&quot; The hospital director approached, practically glowing with anticipation. &quot;Your mother&#x27;s donation will fund our new pediatric wing. We&#x27;re beyond grateful.&quot;<br/><br/>I nodded, accepting her gratitude with the perfect blend of humility and confidence Victoria had taught me. &quot;Kane Industries believes in investing in the future. These children deserve our best efforts.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Absolutely! Would you say a few words during the presentation? Having the Kane heir speak would mean so much.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Of course.&quot; I scanned the room, noting potential business connections, rivals, useful allies. Victoria&#x27;s voice whispering in my head: Always map the battlefield before engaging.<br/><br/>Then I saw them.<br/><br/>Stefan and Rose stood near the bar, him uncomfortable in his tuxedo, her resplendent in red silk that probably cost more than most people&#x27;s monthly salary. They hadn&#x27;t noticed me yet, too busy arguing in fierce whispers behind plastic smiles.<br/><br/>The sight of them still hit like a physical blow. After everything I&#x27;d done to destroy their businesses, after the chaos I&#x27;d engineered in their lives, they still looked... intact. Together. Rose&#x27;s hand still possessively gripping Stefan&#x27;s arm. His head still bent attentively toward her.<br/><br/>Something ugly twisted in my chest. Not jealousy, I&#x27;d moved beyond wanting Stefan back. Something darker. More primitive. The need to see them truly suffer. To watch them crumble completely.<br/><br/>My opportunity arrived sooner than expected.<br/><br/>&quot;Ms. Kane!&quot; Rose&#x27;s voice, pitched to carry just the right distance. &quot;What a pleasure to see you again!&quot;<br/><br/>I turned slowly, slipping on the mask of polite interest I&#x27;d perfected for such moments. &quot;Ms. Lewis. Mr. Rodriguez. Good evening.&quot;<br/><br/>They moved toward me with the desperate eagerness of drowning people spotting a lifeboat. Rose&#x27;s smile too bright, Stefan&#x27;s handshake too firm.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;ve been hoping to run into you,&quot; Rose gushed, positioning herself closer than social etiquette allowed. &quot;Your charity work is so inspiring.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Thank you.&quot; I sipped my champagne, letting silence stretch uncomfortably. Victoria&#x27;s first lesson in power dynamics: Make them work for your attention.<br/><br/>Stefan cleared his throat. &quot;Ms. Kane, I wanted to apologize if I seemed distracted when we met at the gallery opening. Business concerns, you understand.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Of course.&quot; I studied him with cool detachment. &quot;I&#x27;ve heard Rodriguez Shipping is facing... challenges.&quot;<br/><br/>His face tightened. &quot;Temporary setbacks. Nothing we can&#x27;t overcome with the right partnerships.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose jumped in smoothly. &quot;Which is actually something we hoped to discuss. Your mother mentioned Kane Industries might be looking for shipping partners in the Asian markets?&quot;<br/><br/>Their desperation was palpable, hanging in the air between us like cheap perfume. It took everything I had not to smile at the beautiful irony. Here they stood, begging for help from the very woman they&#x27;d destroyed, seeking salvation from the architect of their downfall.<br/><br/>&quot;Kane Industries is always exploring new opportunities,&quot; I replied, noncommittal. &quot;Though we have very strict criteria for potential partners.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Rodriguez Shipping has an impeccable reputation,&quot; Stefan insisted, leaning forward, eyes intense. The same eyes that had once looked into mine with false promises of forever. &quot;Three generations of excellence.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Three generations,&quot; I mused. &quot;Such a shame to see that legacy threatened.&quot;<br/><br/>He flinched as if I&#x27;d struck him. &quot;The company will recover. With the right support.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And your fashion line, Ms. Lewis?&quot; I turned to Rose. &quot;I understand you&#x27;re also seeking investors?&quot;<br/><br/>Her perfect smile faltered slightly. &quot;Word travels fast in New York. Yes, we&#x27;re in expansion talks with several interested parties.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;How interesting.&quot; I took another sip of champagne. &quot;Given the recent quality issues reported in fashion blogs.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Malicious rumors.&quot; Her voice hardened even as her smile remained fixed. &quot;Competitors trying to damage my brand&#x27;s reputation.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Competitors can be so... ruthless.&quot; I let my gaze drift over her shoulder, dismissive. &quot;The business world is unforgiving that way.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s hand tightened on Stefan&#x27;s arm, her knuckles whitening. &quot;Ms. Kane, perhaps we could meet privately? Discuss how Kane Industries and our businesses might benefit each other?&quot;<br/><br/>The sheer audacity nearly made me laugh. After everything they&#x27;d done to me, they expected me to help them? To save them?<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m afraid my schedule is quite full,&quot; I said, my tone cooling several degrees. &quot;But you&#x27;re welcome to submit proposals through our investment division.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;ve tried.&quot; Stefan&#x27;s composure slipped, revealing the desperation beneath. &quot;Your people won&#x27;t return our calls. If you could just put in a word...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;A word?&quot; I raised an eyebrow. &quot;From me?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Your influence with Victoria Kane is well-known,&quot; Rose pressed, stepping closer. The scent of her perfume, the same one she&#x27;d worn when comforting me after Stefan became distance during our marriage, made my stomach turn. &quot;Just a small recommendation. An introduction.&quot;<br/><br/>I studied them both, savoring the moment. The great Rose Lewis and Stefan Rodriguez, reduced to begging for scraps of attention. For a moment, I allowed myself to imagine telling them everything. Removing my careful mask and watching recognition dawn in their eyes. Seeing them understand exactly who held their fate in her hands.<br/><br/>But the time wasn&#x27;t right. The game wasn&#x27;t finished.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ll consider it,&quot; I said finally. &quot;Though I should warn you, my mother values loyalty above all else. She has little patience for those who... discard their commitments when convenient.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan&#x27;s face paled slightly. Did he hear the accusation beneath my words? Did some part of him sense who was really standing before him?<br/><br/>&quot;We understand,&quot; Rose said quickly. &quot;Loyalty is everything to us as well. Family values are the foundation of both our businesses.&quot;<br/><br/>The hypocrisy burned like acid. Family values? From the woman who had systematically destroyed her sister&#x27;s life? Who had likely arranged her &quot;accident&quot; when convenient?<br/><br/>&quot;How fortunate for you both.&quot; I glanced past them, signaling the conversation&#x27;s end. &quot;If you&#x27;ll excuse me, the hospital director is waiting.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Of course.&quot; Rose reached for my hand, squeezing it with false warmth. &quot;Thank you for considering our request. It means everything to us.&quot;<br/><br/>I allowed the contact, though every cell in my body screamed to pull away. &quot;I&#x27;m sure it does.&quot;<br/><br/>As I moved through the crowd, their eyes followed me. I felt their desperate hope, their growing fear. I had become what they never expected, someone with power over them. Someone who could save or destroy their carefully built world with a single word.<br/><br/>Victoria waited near the stage, regal in black Chanel. &quot;Productive conversation?&quot; she asked, having observed the entire exchange.<br/><br/>&quot;Very.&quot; I accepted another glass of champagne from a passing waiter. &quot;They&#x27;re desperate. The Asian shipping routes collapse hit them harder than we anticipated.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Good.&quot; Satisfaction glinted in Victoria&#x27;s eyes. &quot;And your fashion line attack?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Rose is panicking. Trying to hide it, but she&#x27;s losing clients. The quality control rumors we spread are gaining traction.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Excellent.&quot; Victoria&#x27;s smile held all the warmth of a predator spotting prey. &quot;And your... personal reaction?&quot;<br/><br/>The question caught me off guard. Victoria rarely concerned herself with emotions, focusing instead on strategy and results.<br/><br/>&quot;They don&#x27;t recognize me,&quot; I said carefully. &quot;Even up close. Even with time to study my face.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Of course they don&#x27;t. Dr. Torres&#x27; work was impeccable.&quot; Victoria watched me closely. &quot;But that wasn&#x27;t what I asked.&quot;<br/><br/>I met her gaze directly. &quot;It felt... powerful. Seeing them beg for help from the woman they tried to destroy.&quot;<br/><br/>She nodded, apparently satisfied. &quot;Remember that feeling. It&#x27;s why we&#x27;re doing this. Why all the preparation matters.&quot;<br/><br/>But as I followed her toward the stage for the evening&#x27;s presentations, I wondered if power alone was what I&#x27;d felt. Beneath the satisfaction, something else lurked. Something that had stirred when Stefan&#x27;s eyes met mine, searching for help I would never give.<br/><br/>Not regret, exactly. Not compassion. But a shadow of the woman I&#x27;d once been. The woman who had loved without reservation. Who had believed in second chances.<br/><br/>That woman was gone, I reminded myself. Transformed by betrayal and Victoria&#x27;s careful guidance into someone stronger. Someone who would never again be victim to their manipulations.<br/><br/>As I took the podium to speak about Kane Industries&#x27; commitment to helping children, I spotted them watching from the crowd. Rose&#x27;s calculating gaze. Stefan&#x27;s desperate hope.<br/><br/>Neither of them would sleep well tonight, wondering if Camille Kane would throw them a lifeline or let them drown.<br/><br/>The thought brought a genuine smile to my face as I began my speech.</p></div>
