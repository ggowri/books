        <h1>Chapter 101-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 101<br/><br/>The clock on Camille&#x27;s office wall ticked past eleven. Most of Kane Industries had emptied hours ago, but Camille couldn&#x27;t rest, not with Victoria&#x27;s revelations about Herod Preston still echoing in her mind.<br/><br/>A soft knock pulled her from her thoughts.<br/><br/>&quot;Come in,&quot; she called.<br/><br/>Hannah Zhao, the Phoenix Grid&#x27;s chief engineer, entered clutching a stack of rolled blueprints. Her normally neat appearance had frayed, hair escaping its bun, dark circles under her eyes.<br/><br/>&quot;Ms. Kane, I&#x27;m sorry to bother you so late, but...&quot; Hannah hesitated.<br/><br/>Camille motioned to the chair across from her desk. &quot;It&#x27;s fine. What&#x27;s wrong?&quot;<br/><br/>Hannah sat, placing the blueprints between them. &quot;I&#x27;ve been going over these since the groundbreaking ceremony.&quot; She unrolled the top sheet. &quot;Something feels... off.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Off how?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;After finding those modifications to the safety protocols last week, I started comparing every version of the blueprints.&quot;<br/><br/>She pointed to a section showing the Grid&#x27;s main junction box. &quot;This is what I designed originally,&quot; Hannah said, then unrolled a second blueprint. &quot;And this is what&#x27;s currently on file for construction.&quot;<br/><br/>To Camille&#x27;s untrained eye, they looked identical.<br/><br/>&quot;What am I missing?&quot; she asked.<br/><br/>Hannah retrieved a magnifying glass. &quot;Look at the temperature sensors here, here, and here. The specifications are off by tiny increments. Half a millimeter in placement. Two degrees in the trigger threshold. A slight delay in response time.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille examined the areas Hannah indicated. &quot;These are very small changes.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Individually, yes. But collectively? These modifications would allow the junction boxes to overheat without triggering the emergency shutdown protocols. The system would continue operating as if everything were normal, even as temperatures reached dangerous levels.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;How dangerous?&quot;<br/><br/>Hannah met her eyes directly. &quot;Catastrophic failure. Potential explosions at multiple sites. Massive power outages. And the modifications would make it look like design flaws, like Kane Industries had built an inherently unsafe system.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille sat back, the implications hitting her. This wasn&#x27;t just sabotage, it was character assassination.<br/><br/>&quot;When did you first notice these discrepancies?&quot; Camille asked.<br/><br/>&quot;I caught some before the groundbreaking, the ones I showed you and Mr. Pierce last week. We fixed those. But these are different. More subtle. It&#x27;s like someone went through twice, making different kinds of changes.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Or two different people made changes,&quot; Camille murmured, thinking of Rose and Herod.<br/><br/>&quot;Maybe.&quot; Hannah looked uneasy. &quot;What I can&#x27;t figure out is how anyone got access. Our system requires multiple authorizations, biometric verification....&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Someone on the inside.&quot; Camille stood abruptly. &quot;Keep this between us for now. I&#x27;m calling Mr. Pierce, and then we&#x27;re going through every blueprint. Every specification.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That could take all night,&quot; Hannah said.<br/><br/>Camille nodded grimly. &quot;Then we&#x27;d better get started.&quot;<br/><br/>** **<br/><br/>By one in the morning, Camille&#x27;s office had transformed. Blueprints covered every surface,vher desk, the conference table, even sections of the floor. Hannah had sketched diagrams on the glass wall with erasable markers.<br/><br/>Alexander had arrived within thirty minutes of Camille&#x27;s call, bringing coffee and a focused intensity. He now sat cross-legged on the floor, comparing circuit diagrams.<br/><br/>&quot;Seventeen distinct modifications,&quot; Hannah announced, adding another mark to her tally. &quot;All made within the last three weeks.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;All targeting safety systems,&quot; Alexander added. &quot;Nothing that would affect performance during testing or initial operation.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;They wanted it to fail spectacularly. After we&#x27;d declared it safe.&quot; Camille rubbed her eyes. &quot;After people started relying on it.&quot;<br/><br/>Hannah picked up another blueprint. &quot;They focus on the intersection points, where our system connects to the city&#x27;s existing power grid. That&#x27;s where feedback loops could create the most damage.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Maximum chaos,&quot; Alexander said. &quot;Maximum blame on Kane Industries.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille moved to the window. &quot;We need to identify who made these changes. Every modification should have a digital signature.&quot;<br/><br/>Hannah nodded, pulling out her laptop. &quot;I can run a trace. But if they were smart enough to access the system...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;They were smart enough to cover their tracks,&quot; Alexander finished.<br/><br/>While Hannah worked, Camille joined Alexander, examining the circuit diagrams. Their shoulders touched as they leaned over the same document. She found comfort in his steady presence.<br/><br/>&quot;Do you think Rose understands any of this technical material?&quot; she asked quietly.<br/><br/>Alexander shook his head. &quot;Not likely. But Herod might. Or they&#x27;ve hired someone.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The electrician,&quot; Camille realized. &quot;Someone on the construction crew. Someone with access and technical knowledge.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Found something!&quot; Hannah interrupted. &quot;The system logs show blueprint access from authorized terminals, but at odd hours. When the primary users weren&#x27;t in the building according to security logs.&quot;<br/><br/>She turned her screen toward them. &quot;See these timestamps? 2:14 AM. 3:47 AM. No one from the engineering team was here.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Stolen credentials,&quot; Alexander suggested.<br/><br/>&quot;Maybe. But look at this entry. The biometric scan registered as Louis Brown, one of our senior electricians. At 4:30 AM on a Sunday.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Could someone have faked his biometrics?&quot; Camille asked.<br/><br/>Hannah shook her head. &quot;Not easily. Our system uses multiple validation points, fingerprint, retinal scan, and voice recognition.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille and Alexander exchanged a look. &quot;So either Louis is involved, or someone forced him to provide access.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Either way, we need to find him.&quot; Alexander pulled out his phone.<br/><br/>&quot;Wait,&quot; Camille placed her hand over his. &quot;If he is working with Rose and Herod, and we confront him directly...&quot;</div>
