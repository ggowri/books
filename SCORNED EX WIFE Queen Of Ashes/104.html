        <h1>Chapter 75-2</h1>
        <div><br/>Rose wrapped a towel around her bleeding hand and returned to the living room, stepping over broken glass and torn fabric. She found her laptop buried under a pile of shredded documents and opened it.<br/><br/>First, she needed to understand how bad the damage was. Her fingers flew across the keyboard as she checked news sites, social media, financial reports. It was worse than she thought. #CamilleReturns was trending. Videos from the gala had gone viral. Her own screamed confession was being shared millions of times.<br/><br/>Her fashion line was officially dead. Her remaining business partners had all issued statements distancing themselves from her. Her bank accounts were indeed frozen pending investigation.<br/><br/>She had nothing left. Almost nothing.<br/><br/>Rose clicked on a news story about Victoria Kane. The woman was powerful, yes, but not untouchable. Everyone had weaknesses. Everyone had secrets.<br/><br/>Including Camille.<br/><br/>Rose leaned back, her mind racing. Camille had faked her death. There would be legal implications to that. Insurance fraud, perhaps? And what about Victoria&#x27;s role in the deception? There had to be something there, one angle Rose could exploit.<br/><br/>She pulled out a notebook and began to write, ignoring the blood that occasionally smeared the page. She listed everyone connected to Camille and Victoria. She noted possible vulnerabilities, potential allies. She mapped out scenarios, strategies, points of attack.<br/><br/>By dawn, Rose had filled dozens of pages. Her eyes burned from lack of sleep, her hand throbbed where the glass had cut her, but her mind was clear. The path forward was taking shape.<br/><br/>She stood and stretched, surveying the destruction of her apartment in the gray morning light. It looked like a war zone, which was fitting, because that&#x27;s exactly what this was now. War.<br/><br/>Rose walked to the window and looked out over the Manhattan skyline, the sun just beginning to rise behind the skyscrapers. Somewhere out there, Camille was celebrating her victory, thinking she had won.<br/><br/>&quot;Enjoy it while it lasts, sister,&quot; Rose whispered against the glass. &quot;You took everything from me. Now I&#x27;m going to take everything from you. And this time, I won&#x27;t fail.&quot;<br/><br/>She turned from the window, a cold calm settling over her. The initial storm of rage had passed, leaving behind something more dangerous, calculated, patient vengeance.<br/><br/>Rose stepped over the broken glass and torn fabric without a backward glance. She needed a shower, fresh clothes, a new phone. She needed to contact the few people who might still be loyal to her. She needed to start rebuilding.<br/><br/>Because this wasn&#x27;t the end of her story. It was merely the beginning of a new chapter, one where she would no longer be fighting for Stefan or social status or a fashion empire.<br/><br/>Now, she was fighting for pure survival. And there was nothing more dangerous than a woman with nothing left to lose.<br/><br/>Rose smiled as she stepped into the shower, letting hot water wash away the blood and tears and makeup. Let Camille think she had won. Let Victoria Kane believe they had destroyed her completely.<br/><br/>They had no idea what she was capable of.<br/><br/>As steam filled the bathroom, Rose struggled to formulate a plan. She had no leverage against Victoria Kane or Camille. She had no hidden information to use as a weapon. Her finances were frozen, her reputation destroyed. All she had left was her burning desire for revenge and the stubborn refusal to accept defeat.<br/><br/>She shut off the water and wrapped herself in a towel, suddenly feeling more energized than she had in months. There was clarity in complete destruction. Freedom in having nothing left to protect.<br/><br/>Rose looked at herself in the mirror, her appearance disheveled but her eyes burning with determination. She splashed cold water on her face again, washing away the last traces of mascara. <br/><br/>&quot;This isn&#x27;t finished,&quot; she whispered to her reflection. &quot;Not by a long shot.&quot;<br/><br/>She returned to the living room, stepping through the wreckage of her former life. The broken glass crunched beneath her bare feet, but she barely noticed the pain. Physical discomfort meant nothing compared to the humiliation she had endured.<br/><br/>Rose sank into the one chair that remained upright, staring at the wall. She had no leverage against Victoria Kane, the woman was too powerful, too protected. She had no dirt on Camille that hadn&#x27;t already been exposed. She had no money, no allies, no escape plan that would truly work.<br/><br/>But she had her rage. And her determination. And the knowledge that she had rebuilt herself once before, when she had nothing.<br/><br/>&quot;I will find a way,&quot; she said to the empty room. &quot;I don&#x27;t know how yet, but I will.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose curled up in the chair as dawn broke over Manhattan, illuminating the destruction around her. She had no plan yet, no clear path forward. But one thing was certain, this wasn&#x27;t over. Not while she still drew breath.<br/><br/>She would wait. She would watch. And eventually, she would find Camille&#x27;s weakness.<br/><br/>The game had changed, but in Rose&#x27;s mind, it wasn&#x27;t over.<br/><br/>Not even close.<br/></div>
