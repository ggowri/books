        <h1>Chapter 148-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 148<br/><br/>Camille knocked on Victoria&#x27;s office door, files clutched under her arm. The security plans for the gala needed one final approval, and despite Victoria&#x27;s reluctance about the event, Camille knew she would want to review the details.<br/><br/>When no answer came, she knocked again.<br/><br/>Still silence.<br/><br/>Camille turned the handle, expecting to find the office empty. Instead, she found Victoria slumped in her chair, eyes closed, face pale as paper. A small bottle of pills had tipped over on the desk, its contents scattered across important documents.<br/><br/>&quot;Victoria?&quot; Camille rushed forward, files forgotten, falling to the floor.<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s eyes fluttered open. For a moment, confusion clouded her face, then recognition dawned. &quot;Camille. I was just resting my eyes.&quot;<br/><br/>But Camille wasn&#x27;t listening. Her gaze had locked on the pill bottle. The label faced upward, the word &quot;OXYCODONE&quot; visible in bold print, along with Victoria&#x27;s name.<br/><br/>&quot;What are these?&quot; Camille picked up the bottle, dread pooling in her stomach. &quot;Why are you taking such strong pain medication?&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria straightened in her chair, composing herself with visible effort. &quot;It&#x27;s nothing. Just some discomfort from the surgery.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This isn&#x27;t for &#x27;some discomfort,&#x27;&quot; Camille said, reading the dosage on the label. &quot;This is for serious pain. And your surgery was months ago. You should be fully healed by now.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria reached for the bottle, but Camille pulled it away.<br/><br/>&quot;Tell me the truth.&quot; Camille&#x27;s voice shook. &quot;What&#x27;s really going on?&quot;<br/><br/>Something shifted in Victoria&#x27;s eyes, a surrender, a resignation. She sighed deeply, then opened her desk drawer and pulled out a folder.<br/><br/>&quot;I was going to tell you after the gala,&quot; she said, sliding the folder across the desk. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to distract you. Not with Rose still out there. Not with everything at stake.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille stared at the folder, afraid to open it. The hospital logo embossed on its cover told her everything she needed to know.<br/><br/>&quot;How bad is it?&quot; she whispered.<br/><br/>&quot;Open it,&quot; Victoria said gently.<br/><br/>With trembling fingers, Camille opened the folder. Medical terms jumped out at her: &quot;metastatic pancreatic carcinoma,&quot; &quot;stage four,&quot; &quot;poor prognosis.&quot; Dates of treatments. Surgical notes. Oncologist recommendations.<br/><br/>But one sentence burned into her brain: &quot;Estimated survival: 3-6 months.&quot;<br/><br/>The room tilted around her. Camille gripped the edge of the desk to steady herself.<br/><br/>&quot;Three to six months?&quot; Her voice sounded strange in her own ears, distant and hollow. &quot;That&#x27;s... that can&#x27;t be right.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The estimates are often conservative,&quot; Victoria said, her tone matter-of-fact. &quot;I could have longer.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Or shorter.&quot; The words escaped before Camille could stop them.<br/><br/>Victoria didn&#x27;t answer, which was answer enough.<br/><br/>&quot;How long have you known?&quot; Camille asked, papers crumpling in her tight grip.<br/><br/>&quot;Since before the bombing of the substations. The first symptoms started even earlier.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille stood abruptly, the chair scraping against the floor. &quot;All this time? All these months, you&#x27;ve been dying, and you didn&#x27;t tell me?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I was protecting you.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;From what?&quot; Camille&#x27;s voice rose. &quot;From the truth? From having time to prepare? From being able to help you?&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s face softened, showing a vulnerability Camille had rarely seen. &quot;From pain, Camille. I was protecting you from pain. You&#x27;ve had enough of that in your life.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That wasn&#x27;t your choice to make!&quot; Tears spilled down Camille&#x27;s cheeks now, hot and angry. &quot;We&#x27;re supposed to be partners. Family. You don&#x27;t keep something like this from family.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria flinched at the word &quot;family,&quot; and suddenly Camille understood.<br/><br/>&quot;You didn&#x27;t tell me because you didn&#x27;t want me to act like your daughter,&quot; she said, the realization bitter in her mouth. &quot;You wanted me to focus on the company. On becoming your successor.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No.&quot; Victoria reached for Camille&#x27;s hand, but Camille stepped back. &quot;That&#x27;s not it at all.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Then why?&quot; Camille demanded. &quot;Why hide something this important?&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria stood with effort, her face tightening with pain as she moved. &quot;Because I couldn&#x27;t bear to see you look at me the way you&#x27;re looking at me now. With pity. With grief. Like I&#x27;m already gone.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;How did you expect me to look when I found out the woman who saved my life is dying?&quot; Camille&#x27;s voice broke on the last word.<br/><br/>Victoria moved around the desk, closing the distance between them. &quot;I expected you to be strong. To be ready to carry on without me. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been preparing you for all along.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I thought you were preparing me to work beside you,&quot; Camille said. &quot;Not to replace you.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria took Camille&#x27;s hands, her grip surprisingly firm despite her weakened state. &quot;Listen to me. What we&#x27;ve built together,Kane Industries, the Phoenix Grid, your transformation, it can&#x27;t end when I do. It needs to continue. You need to continue.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille pulled her hands away. &quot;How can you talk about business at a time like this? We should be discussing treatments. Specialists. Clinical trials.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ve seen every specialist worth seeing,&quot; Victoria said patiently. &quot;Tried every treatment with any chance of success. The cancer has spread too far, too fast.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;So you&#x27;re just giving up?&quot; Anger flared again, hot and desperate. &quot;The Victoria Kane I know would never surrender without a fight.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I have fought.&quot; For the first time, real emotion cracked Victoria&#x27;s composed exterior. &quot;I have fought with everything I have. But some battles can&#x27;t be won, Camille. Some enemies can&#x27;t be defeated through sheer will.&quot;<br/><br/>The vulnerability in Victoria&#x27;s voice – something Camille had never heard before – punctured her anger. Suddenly, she saw not the formidable businesswoman who had rescued and transformed her, but a woman facing her own mortality. Afraid. In pain. Alone.<br/><br/>Camille&#x27;s anger dissolved, replaced by a wave of pure grief so powerful it nearly knocked her off her feet. She stumbled forward, wrapping her arms around Victoria.<br/><br/>&quot;Don&#x27;t leave me,&quot; she sobbed against Victoria&#x27;s shoulder. &quot;Please don&#x27;t leave me, Mommy.&quot;<br/><br/>The word slipped out without thought, a raw, honest expression of what Victoria had truly become to her. Not just a mentor. Not just a business partner. But a mother who had saved her, protected her, loved her when she needed it most.<br/><br/>Victoria froze for a moment, then her arms came around Camille, holding her tightly. Camille felt a dampness against her hair and realized Victoria was crying too – silent tears she had probably never allowed herself to shed in front of anyone.<br/><br/>&quot;My girl,&quot; Victoria whispered, her voice thick with emotion. &quot;My wonderful girl.&quot;<br/><br/>They stood like that, holding each other, tears mingling. For a moment, there was no Kane Industries, no Rose, no upcoming gala. Just a mother and daughter facing the cruelest separation.<br/><br/>A knock at the door interrupted them. They pulled apart as Alexander entered, his expression changing instantly as he took in the scene, Victoria&#x27;s pallor, Camille&#x27;s tear-streaked face, the medical files on the desk.<br/><br/>&quot;What happened?&quot; he asked, closing the door behind him.<br/><br/>Camille couldn&#x27;t speak. Victoria answered for her, her voice steadier than her tear-stained face suggested.<br/><br/>&quot;She knows,&quot; Victoria said. &quot;About my condition.&quot;<br/><br/>Understanding dawned on Alexander&#x27;s face. &quot;I see.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille spun toward him, fresh betrayal cutting through her grief. &quot;You knew? You knew and you didn&#x27;t tell me?&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander approached her carefully, as one might approach a wounded animal. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t my place to tell you, Camille. Victoria asked me to respect her privacy.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Everyone knew but me,&quot; Camille said bitterly. &quot;My parents. You. Probably half the board members too.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Only Alexander and your mother knew,&quot; Victoria corrected. &quot;And only because I needed their help with certain arrangements.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Arrangements.&quot; Camille spat the word. &quot;You mean your will. Your funeral plans. All the details of your death that you kept from me.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander reached for her, but Camille stepped away. &quot;Don&#x27;t. Just... don&#x27;t.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria swayed slightly, gripping the edge of the desk. Alexander moved quickly to her side, helping her back into her chair.<br/><br/>&quot;You should rest,&quot; he told her. &quot;The doctor said....&quot;</div>
