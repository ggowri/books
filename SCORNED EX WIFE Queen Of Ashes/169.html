        <h1>Chapter 113-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 113<br/><br/>Victoria Kane sat propped against white hospital pillows, her silver hair swept back from her face in a neat chignon. Even in a hospital gown, connected to monitors that beeped rhythmically in the background, she maintained an air of command. The room, the hospital&#x27;s finest private suite, had been transformed with fresh flowers, silk sheets from her home, and a mahogany lap desk now balanced across her knees.<br/><br/>Her lawyer, Frederick Winters, a man who had served the Kane family for thirty years, sat in an armchair beside the bed. His silver-rimmed glasses caught the afternoon light as he arranged documents with practiced precision.<br/><br/>&quot;You&#x27;re certain about this?&quot; he asked, his voice low and measured. &quot;The board will have questions.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s mouth thinned. &quot;The board&#x27;s questions are not my concern, Frederick. My decision is final.&quot;<br/><br/>The door opened, and Camille entered, dressed in a tailored navy suit that Victoria recognized as one she had selected for her. Their eyes met, an understanding passing between them. Victoria gestured to the chair on the opposite side of her bed.<br/><br/>&quot;Good, you&#x27;re here. We can begin.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille glanced at Frederick, then back to Victoria. &quot;Begin what?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Updating my will,&quot; Victoria answered matter-of-factly. &quot;Please, sit.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille lowered herself into the chair, her movements careful, as if the ground beneath her might suddenly give way. For the past two days, she had been splitting her time between the hospital and Kane Industries, maintaining the fiction that Victoria was simply working remotely while recovering from exhaustion. Only Alexander knew the truth, that Victoria was fighting for her life, with surgery scheduled for the following morning.<br/><br/>&quot;Is this really necessary right now?&quot; Camille asked quietly. &quot;The doctors said you should rest before tomorrow&#x27;s procedure.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria waved away her concern. &quot;I don&#x27;t leave matters of importance to chance, Camille. You know that.&quot;<br/><br/>Frederick cleared his throat. &quot;Ms. Kane has asked me to prepare a new version of her last will and testament, along with updated instructions regarding the control of Kane Industries in the event of her... incapacitation.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille&#x27;s fingers tightened on the armrests. &quot;You&#x27;re going to be fine. The doctors said the procedure has an excellent success rate.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Of course,&quot; Victoria said, though something in her eyes suggested she was less certain than her words implied. &quot;But prudence dictates preparation, regardless of probability.&quot;<br/><br/>She turned to Frederick. &quot;Proceed.&quot;<br/><br/>Frederick adjusted his glasses. &quot;The primary change concerns the disposition of Ms. Kane&#x27;s personal estate and her controlling interest in Kane Industries. Previously, these assets were divided among several beneficiaries and charitable foundations.&quot;<br/><br/>He glanced at Victoria, who nodded for him to continue.<br/><br/>&quot;Under the new will, Ms. Kane names you, Camille Kane, as her sole heir and successor. This includes all personal property, financial assets, real estate holdings, and her sixty percent controlling interest in Kane Industries.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille felt the air leave her lungs in a rush. She stared at Victoria, searching her face for some explanation. &quot;Victoria, I...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The decision is made,&quot; Victoria interrupted, her tone brooking no argument. She turned to Frederick. &quot;Show her the documents.&quot;<br/><br/>Frederick handed Camille a thick folder. She opened it with unsteady fingers, scanning pages dense with legal terminology. Numbers jumped out at her, figures with so many zeros they seemed unreal.<br/><br/>&quot;This is... everything,&quot; she whispered.<br/><br/>&quot;Yes,&quot; Victoria confirmed simply.<br/><br/>&quot;But why? There must be others, board members who&#x27;ve been with you for decades, charitable foundations, relatives....&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No relatives,&quot; Victoria corrected. &quot;Not since Sophia.&quot; A shadow crossed her face at the mention of her daughter. &quot;As for the board, they serve at the pleasure of the controlling shareholder. And the foundations will continue to receive their annual donations as stipulated in separate agreements.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s gaze held Camille&#x27;s, unwavering. &quot;You are my heir, Camille. The daughter of my choice, if not my blood. I have watched you transform from a woman broken by betrayal into someone extraordinary. Someone worthy of everything I&#x27;ve built.&quot;<br/><br/>Emotion closed Camille&#x27;s throat. She thought of the night Victoria had found her in that hotel parking garage, beaten and left for dead by Rose&#x27;s hired thugs. The moment Victoria had offered her a choice, to run away and start over elsewhere, or to stay and become something new. She had chosen revenge then, but somewhere along the way, that choice had led to something unexpected, a bond between her and Victoria that transcended mentor and student.<br/><br/>&quot;There are a few additional provisions,&quot; Frederick continued when Camille remained silent. &quot;A personal letter to be delivered to you in the event of Ms. Kane&#x27;s death. Instructions for the continuation of the Phoenix Grid project. And specific directives regarding certain individuals Ms. Kane considers... adversaries.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s lips curved in a cold smile. &quot;Insurance policies, you might say.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille knew she meant Rose and Herod. Even facing surgery, Victoria was thinking ten moves ahead, planning counters to attacks that hadn&#x27;t yet materialized.<br/><br/>&quot;I don&#x27;t want to have this conversation,&quot; Camille said suddenly. &quot;You&#x27;re going to survive the surgery. You&#x27;re going to recover. We can discuss succession plans after you&#x27;re back at the office.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria reached out, taking Camille&#x27;s hand in a rare gesture of physical affection. Her skin felt cool and paper-thin, the blue veins visible beneath the surface.<br/><br/>&quot;Camille,&quot; she said softly. &quot;Look at me.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille raised her eyes reluctantly.<br/><br/>&quot;I have lived my life preparing for every possibility,&quot; Victoria continued. &quot;It&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve survived this long in a world eager to see women like me fail. Tomorrow may go perfectly according to plan—I certainly intend it to—but I will not leave anything to chance. Not my company. Not my legacy. And especially not your future.&quot;<br/><br/>She squeezed Camille&#x27;s hand once before releasing it. &quot;Now, shall we proceed with the signatures, Frederick?&quot;</div>
