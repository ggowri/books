        <h1>Chapter 138-2</h1>
        <div><br/>&quot;Nothing.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille laughed, a sharp, harsh sound with no humor. &quot;Stefan always wants something.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;He wants to help. To make amends, in whatever small way he can.&quot; Alexander watched her carefully. &quot;I told him everything goes through me. He won&#x27;t contact you directly.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You believe him?&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander considered the question. &quot;I believe he regrets what he did to you. Whether that makes him trustworthy is another question.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille rose from her chair, walking to the window that overlooked the city. The afternoon sun glinted off distant buildings, a stark contrast to the darkness of their conversation.<br/><br/>&quot;I never expected him to care what happened to me. Not after everything.&quot; Her voice was soft, almost wondering. &quot;It feels strange. Like finding money in the pocket of a coat you haven&#x27;t worn in years. Unexpected, but ultimately meaningless.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander joined her at the window. &quot;I told him I&#x27;d use his information, but that&#x27;s all. If you don&#x27;t want his help....&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No.&quot; Camille turned to face him. &quot;Use him. Use whatever resources we have. Rose is escalating. If Stefan can help us stop her before anyone else gets hurt...&quot; She paused, a complex mix of emotions crossing her face. &quot;It doesn&#x27;t erase what he did. But it&#x27;s something.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ll handle him,&quot; Alexander promised. &quot;You won&#x27;t have to see him or speak to him.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Actually,&quot; Camille said slowly, &quot;I think I should meet with him. Once.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander frowned. &quot;Are you sure? After everything he did...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m not the woman he betrayed anymore.&quot; Camille touched the phoenix pendant at her throat, a gesture that had become almost instinctive. &quot;That Camille died in a parking garage. I want him to see who I&#x27;ve become. And I want to look him in the eye when he explains why he&#x27;s doing this.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander recognized the determination in her eyes. The same look she&#x27;d had when facing the press after the bombings. The look of a woman who had walked through fire and emerged stronger.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ll arrange it,&quot; he said. &quot;Somewhere secure.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded, then returned to her desk, pulling up the security files again. &quot;Half a million dollars buys a lot of damage,&quot; she said, her focus returning to the threat at hand. &quot;We need to increase security at all remaining substations. And at the main control hub.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Already done.&quot; Alexander touched her shoulder gently. &quot;We&#x27;ll stop her, Camille.&quot;<br/><br/>She covered his hand with hers, drawing strength from his touch. &quot;Yes, we will.&quot; A faint smile touched her lips. &quot;And then, when this is over, we&#x27;ll have that wedding we talked about.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Is that a promise, Ms. Kane?&quot; Alexander asked, his voice softening.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s a certainty, Mr. Pierce.&quot;<br/><br/>** ***<br/><br/>The following morning, Stefan arrived at Pierce Tower, escorted by two security guards to a private conference room on the top floor. He&#x27;d expected to meet Alexander. He was not prepared to see Camille rise from her chair as he entered.<br/><br/>She looked different than he remembered. Stronger. Her posture straight and confident, her eyes clear and direct. The woman before him bore little resemblance to the broken creature who had signed divorce papers Twenty two months ago.<br/><br/>&quot;Camille,&quot; he breathed, stopping in his tracks. &quot;I didn&#x27;t expect....&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Sit down, Stefan.&quot; Her voice was cool, professional. Not angry, not sad. Simply distant.<br/><br/>He sank into a chair across from her, suddenly aware of his rumpled appearance, the weight he&#x27;d lost, the shadows under his eyes. Alexander stood by the window, his posture protective, watching Stefan like a hawk.<br/><br/>&quot;Alexander showed me what you brought him,&quot; Camille said. &quot;Thank you for the information.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan nodded, his throat tight. &quot;I&#x27;ll get more. I have a meeting with someone close to Bessonov tonight.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Why are you doing this?&quot; Camille asked, the direct question catching him off guard.<br/><br/>Stefan looked down at his hands. &quot;Because I owe you. Because it&#x27;s the right thing to do.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You never cared about the right thing before.&quot;<br/><br/>The truth of her words stung, but he didn&#x27;t argue. &quot;No. I didn&#x27;t.&quot; He forced himself to meet her gaze. &quot;I can&#x27;t fix what I broke, Camille. I know that. But I can&#x27;t stand by and watch Rose hurt you again.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Why now? After all this time?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Because I finally see clearly.&quot; His voice dropped to nearly a whisper. &quot;Because when I heard about the bombings, my first thought wasn&#x27;t about Rose or myself. It was about whether you were safe.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille studied him, searching for deception. Finding none, her expression softened slightly. &quot;You look terrible.&quot;<br/><br/>A surprised laugh escaped him. &quot;Thank you. I feel worse than I look.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Good.&quot; But there was no malice in her voice. &quot;Alexander says you&#x27;ve agreed to help. That everything goes through him.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes. Whatever terms you set, I&#x27;ll accept them.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille glanced at Alexander, who nodded almost imperceptibly. She returned her gaze to Stefan. &quot;Then I accept your help. But understand this, it changes nothing between us. The past is still the past.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I understand.&quot; Relief flooded through him. &quot;Thank you for this chance. I won&#x27;t let you down.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;See that you don&#x27;t.&quot; She stood, indicating the meeting was over. &quot;Alexander will be your contact. If you learn anything about Rose or Bessonov, you tell him immediately.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan rose as well, knowing he&#x27;d been dismissed. At the door, he paused, turning back to look at the woman he&#x27;d once called his wife. &quot;You found someone who deserves you,&quot; he said quietly, glancing at Alexander. &quot;I&#x27;m glad.&quot;<br/><br/>Something flickered in Camille&#x27;s eyes, not forgiveness, but perhaps the beginning of peace. &quot;Goodbye, Stefan.&quot;<br/><br/>After he left, Camille turned to Alexander, emotion finally breaking through her composed facade. &quot;That was harder than I expected.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander crossed the room, drawing her into his arms. &quot;You were magnificent. As always.&quot;<br/><br/>She leaned into his embrace, allowing herself a moment of vulnerability. &quot;Do you think we can trust him?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I think he&#x27;s desperate to prove himself. To you, to himself.&quot; Alexander stroked her hair gently. &quot;We&#x27;ll use his information but verify everything. And I&#x27;ll make sure he never has access to anything sensitive.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded against his chest. &quot;It&#x27;s strange. Seeing him try to do the right thing after everything. Part of me wants to believe he&#x27;s changed.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;People can change,&quot; Alexander said softly. &quot;You did. I did.&quot; <br/><br/>&quot;The difference is, we changed for ourselves. Not for someone else&#x27;s forgiveness.&quot; She pulled back slightly, looking up at him. &quot;But if his information helps us stop Rose, I won&#x27;t turn it away.&quot;<br/></div>
