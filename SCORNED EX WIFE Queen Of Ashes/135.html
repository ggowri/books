        <div><br/>Victoria&#x27;s expression remained neutral. &quot;Focus on the present crisis. We&#x27;ll deal with the source later.&quot;<br/><br/>The lights seemed unnaturally bright as Camille approached the podium, Victoria and Alexander flanking her.<br/><br/>&quot;Good afternoon,&quot; Camille began, her voice clear and strong. &quot;I&#x27;m here to address rumors regarding the Phoenix Grid technology. These allegations are categorically false, based on misunderstood or deliberately manipulated information.&quot;<br/><br/>She gestured to the screen showing Hannah&#x27;s safety report in simplified graphic form.<br/><br/>&quot;The Phoenix Grid distribution nodes have been tested at three times maximum operational temperature without any safety concerns. The fire risk described is technically impossible given our design specifications.&quot;<br/><br/>A reporter called out: &quot;Why would whistleblowers make these claims if there&#x27;s no substance?&quot;<br/><br/>Camille met his gaze directly. &quot;We&#x27;ve found no evidence these &#x27;whistleblowers&#x27; exist. These rumours appeared simultaneously across multiple platforms, a coordinated attack, not a genuine safety concern.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Are you suggesting corporate sabotage?&quot; another reporter asked.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m stating facts,&quot; Camille replied coolly. &quot;The Phoenix Grid has undergone rigorous testing by independent laboratories. Those results are publicly available.&quot;<br/><br/>She continued dismantling the allegations point by point. When technical questions arose, Hannah Zhao offered precise explanations that reassured without overwhelming the audience.<br/><br/>By the time the press conference ended, the stock had stabilized, regaining two percentage points.<br/><br/>As they exited, Alexander showed Camille his tablet, social media sentiment shifting as technical experts confirmed their safety claims.<br/><br/>&quot;Crisis contained,&quot; he said, relief evident.<br/><br/>&quot;For now,&quot; Camille replied, unable to shake her unease. &quot;This was too well-planned to be a one-time attack.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander nodded. &quot;I&#x27;ve assigned a team to trace the source. If there&#x27;s a connection to Rose, we&#x27;ll find it.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;She&#x27;s behind this,&quot; Camille insisted as they walked toward the elevator. &quot;I can feel it.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Even if she is,&quot; Victoria interjected, &quot;Rose lacks the resources and technical knowledge to execute something this sophisticated alone.&quot;<br/><br/>The elevator doors closed, sealing the three of them in privacy.<br/><br/>&quot;Then she has help,&quot; Camille said, frustration edging her voice. &quot;Someone with money, influence, and a grudge against Kane Industries.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That describes half of Wall Street,&quot; Victoria replied dryly.<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s phone buzzed. He checked it, his expression turning grim. &quot;Security reports unusual access attempts on our engineering servers last night. Nothing breached, but someone was probing for weaknesses.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille felt cold certainty settle in her stomach. &quot;This is just the beginning, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;<br/><br/>Neither Victoria nor Alexander contradicted her.<br/><br/>** **<br/><br/>That evening, Victoria called Camille and Alexander to her private office. The large circular room, with its panoramic views of Manhattan, felt like a war room.<br/><br/>&quot;The final damage report,&quot; Victoria began, sliding tablets across her desk. &quot;Stock closed down six percent. Four institutional investors have expressed &#x27;concerns&#x27; about the Phoenix Grid. Two regulators have requested additional safety documentation.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander reviewed the information. &quot;Better than we feared, worse than we hoped.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The press conference helped,&quot; Victoria acknowledged. &quot;But doubt has been planted.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille scrolled through the reports. &quot;Has security made any progress identifying the source?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Nothing concrete,&quot; Victoria admitted. &quot;But the timing is too perfect to be coincidence. Three days before groundbreaking, just as final preparations are underway.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Someone knows our schedule intimately,&quot; Alexander added. &quot;Someone with access to internal planning.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We need to investigate everyone with access to the Phoenix Grid specifications,&quot; Camille said. &quot;Current employees, former employees, contractors, suppliers.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Already in progress,&quot; Victoria assured her. &quot;But this feels personal, Camille. Targeted specifically at your project.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Rose,&quot; Camille said, the name like acid on her tongue. &quot;She&#x27;s been silent too long. This is exactly her style, wait until I feel secure, then strike where it hurts most.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander leaned forward. &quot;Rose lacks the technical expertise to understand the Phoenix Grid specifications.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;She doesn&#x27;t need to understand them,&quot; Camille countered. &quot;She just needs to find someone who does.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s expression remained thoughtful. &quot;The question is how she&#x27;s executing it, and who&#x27;s helping her.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander stood. &quot;We should consider postponing the groundbreaking ceremonies.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No,&quot; Camille said firmly. &quot;That&#x27;s exactly what they want. If we delay, it only validates the rumors.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria studied her, approval flickering in her eyes. &quot;Agreed. We proceed as planned, but with enhanced security.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I want to find Rose,&quot; Camille said suddenly. &quot;Look her in the eye, see what she&#x27;s planning.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Too risky,&quot; Victoria responded immediately. &quot;Drawing her out now could accelerate whatever she&#x27;s planning.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Or disrupt it,&quot; Camille argued. &quot;Rose has always been reactive. If she sees me unafraid, it might force her to make a mistake.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander returned to the table. &quot;If we could locate Rose, approaching her would need to be handled carefully.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s eyes narrowed. &quot;You&#x27;re considering this.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m considering all options,&quot; he corrected. &quot;Including that drawing Rose into the open might reveal who&#x27;s backing her.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille felt a surge of gratitude toward Alexander. &quot;We know Rose. She can&#x27;t resist gloating. If I confront her directly, she&#x27;ll reveal something, even unintentionally.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria remained unconvinced. &quot;And if it&#x27;s a trap? If she wants you to find her?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Then we set a counter-trap,&quot; Camille replied. &quot;But sitting here waiting for the next attack isn&#x27;t working.&quot;<br/><br/>The three fell silent, each weighing the risks. Outside, darkness had fallen over the city.<br/><br/>&quot;Find her,&quot; Victoria said finally. &quot;But do not approach without a full security plan. And Alexander goes with you.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded, accepting the conditions.<br/><br/>&quot;Now,&quot; Victoria continued, &quot;the Phoenix Grid groundbreaking proceeds in three days. I want hourly security checks at all sites, background rechecks on all personnel, and additional testing on every component.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Already implemented,&quot; Alexander assured her. &quot;Nothing will go wrong at the ceremony.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;See that it doesn&#x27;t,&quot; Victoria replied, her tone leaving no room for failure. &quot;The Phoenix Grid represents more than just a business venture. It&#x27;s Camille&#x27;s statement to the world, that she builds rather than destroys.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille felt the weight of Victoria&#x27;s words. The Phoenix Grid wasn&#x27;t just about energy distribution, it was about her transformation.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;ll find who&#x27;s behind this,&quot; she promised. &quot;And we&#x27;ll stop them.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander reached for her hand under the table, a small gesture of support invisible to Victoria. &quot;Together,&quot; he added quietly.<br/><br/>Camille squeezed his hand in response, drawing strength from his presence. Rose might have help, resources, planning, but Camille had something stronger.<br/><br/>She had truth on her side. And she would not be defeated again.<br/><br/>&quot;Let&#x27;s get to work,&quot; she said, rising from her chair. &quot;We have a groundbreaking to prepare for, and a sister to find.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria nodded, her expression warming slightly as she watched her protégé. &quot;Tomorrow morning, eight o&#x27;clock. Full team briefing.&quot;<br/><br/>As Camille and Alexander left Victoria&#x27;s office, uncertainty still hung in the air. But something else was there too, a renewed sense of purpose, of unity in the face of this invisible threat.<br/><br/>Whatever came next, they would face it together.<br/></div>
