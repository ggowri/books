        <h1>Chapter 140-2</h1>
        <div><br/>&quot;So what happens next?&quot; Herod asked, feeling hollow. &quot;The FBI catches me while you walk away clean?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s one option.&quot; Rose sat on the bed, crossing her legs. &quot;Or we could make a new plan.&quot;<br/><br/>Something in her tone made him wary. &quot;What kind of plan?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We still need to hit the main control center. One final blow to bring down Camille and Victoria.&quot; Rose smiled, the expression not touching her eyes. &quot;You&#x27;re already facing life in prison for the first two bombings. What&#x27;s one more? Especially if it means hurting them where it counts?&quot;<br/><br/>Herod stared at her, unable to believe what he was hearing. &quot;You want me to keep helping you, knowing you&#x27;ve set me up to take the fall?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m offering you a chance to complete what we started.&quot; Rose stood and moved toward him, placing her hand on his chest. &quot;To make Victoria and Camille pay, just like we planned.&quot;<br/><br/>Her touch, once exciting, now made his skin crawl. Yet he couldn&#x27;t pull away. Despite everything, some broken part of him still craved her approval, her touch, her presence.<br/><br/>&quot;And afterward?&quot; he asked.<br/><br/>&quot;Afterward, I help you escape. Get you out of the country with new identity papers, enough money to start over.&quot;<br/><br/>It was a lie. He knew it was a lie. Yet he found himself considering it, weighing his options. The FBI was closing in. His life as he knew it was over. What did he have to lose by playing along with her plan a little longer?<br/><br/>&quot;You&#x27;re asking me to trust you,&quot; he said. &quot;After learning you&#x27;ve betrayed me.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s fingers moved to his face, tracing his jaw. &quot;I&#x27;m asking you to finish what we started. Together.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Until you no longer need me.&quot;<br/><br/>Her smile turned predatory. &quot;Everyone leaves eventually, Herod. At least with me, the ride is exciting while it lasts.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod searched her face, looking for any sign of genuine feeling, any crack in her perfect mask. He found nothing but cold calculation.<br/><br/>&quot;You never cared about me at all, did you?&quot; he asked.<br/><br/>&quot;I cared about what you could provide,&quot; Rose answered, her honesty brutal. &quot;Money. Connections. The means to hurt Camille. And you delivered beautifully.&quot;<br/><br/>The admission should have angered him, should have sent him storming out. Instead, it created a strange calm. The final illusion had been stripped away. He saw Rose clearly now, not as a partner or lover, but as a user. Someone who took what she needed and discarded people when they were no longer useful.<br/><br/>Just as she had done with Stefan. With her parents. With Camille.<br/><br/>And now with him.<br/><br/>&quot;We need to leave this motel,&quot; Rose said, moving away to pack her bag. &quot;The FBI might trace Martinez&#x27;s call. I know another place we can stay while we plan the control center attack.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod watched her efficient movements, the way she packed only essentials, ready to disappear at a moment&#x27;s notice. She was offering him a poisoned choice: continue helping her and face certain capture afterward, or try to run now with the entire FBI hunting him.<br/><br/>&quot;What&#x27;s it going to be, Herod?&quot; Rose asked, zipping her bag closed. &quot;Are you in or out?&quot;<br/><br/>The smart choice was to run. To get as far from Rose as possible. To try to save himself.<br/><br/>But where would he go? His accounts were frozen, his home watched, his face on every news channel. And the thought of being alone, without Rose, created a hollow feeling in his chest that frightened him more than the prospect of prison.<br/><br/>When had he become so dependent on her? When had she become his entire world?<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m in,&quot; he said, the words tasting like ash in his mouth.<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s smile was triumphant. &quot;I knew you would be.&quot; She tossed him his jacket. &quot;Now let&#x27;s go. We have one more job to do.&quot;<br/><br/>As they left the motel room, Herod felt like a man walking to his own execution. Rose had destroyed him, used him, set him up to take the fall for her crimes. Yet here he was, following her into the night, unable to break free from her gravity.<br/><br/>He could still turn around, still go to the FBI and tell them everything. They might not believe him, but at least he&#x27;d have tried to do the right thing.<br/><br/>Instead, he got into the passenger seat of the stolen car Rose had acquired, watching as she started the engine.<br/><br/>&quot;Where are we going?&quot; he asked.<br/><br/>&quot;Somewhere they won&#x27;t find us,&quot; she answered, pulling onto the empty street. &quot;Somewhere we can plan our final move.&quot;<br/><br/>As the city lights blurred past, Herod realized the truth about himself. He wasn&#x27;t just Rose&#x27;s victim, he was her willing accomplice. Too weak to leave. Too broken to fight back. Too addicted to her presence to save himself.<br/><br/>The knowledge should have shamed him. Instead, it brought only a dull acceptance.<br/><br/>Rose reached over and squeezed his hand, the gesture almost caring. &quot;It&#x27;ll be over soon,&quot; she promised. &quot;One more job, and Victoria and Camille will pay for everything they&#x27;ve done.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod nodded, not trusting himself to speak. He knew what &quot;over&quot; meant for him. Prison, if he was lucky. Death, if he wasn&#x27;t.<br/><br/>But as the car sped through the night, taking them toward whatever end Rose had planned, he couldn&#x27;t bring himself to care. He had given her everything, his money, his future, his freedom.<br/><br/>And still, it wasn&#x27;t enough.<br/><br/>It would never be enough.<br/></div>
