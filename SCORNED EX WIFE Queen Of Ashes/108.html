        <h1>Chapter 77-2</h1>
        <div><br/>&quot;No.&quot; Her mother shook her head fiercely. &quot;You might have a different name, a different life, but you&#x27;re still our child. Nothing can change that, not even what Rose did.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This isn&#x27;t about Rose,&quot; Camille said. &quot;Not entirely. Yes, she was my executioner. But you handed her the tools.&quot;<br/><br/>Her parents flinched as if physically struck.<br/><br/>&quot;Every time you praised her at my expense, every time you dismissed my feelings, every time you made it clear she was the daughter you truly wanted, you gave her more power to hurt me. You taught her that she was special, exceptional, deserving of everything she wanted. And you taught me that my pain didn&#x27;t matter, that my instincts couldn&#x27;t be trusted.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille walked back to the window, watching lightning streak across the darkened sky. &quot;When Stefan gave me those divorce papers, do you know why I didn&#x27;t come to you? Because I already knew what you would say. That I must have done something wrong. That I hadn&#x27;t tried hard enough. That perfect Stefan couldn&#x27;t possibly be at fault.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s not true,&quot; her father protested weakly.<br/><br/>&quot;Isn&#x27;t it?&quot; Camille turned to face them again. &quot;When I finally did tell you about his affair with Rose, that&#x27;s exactly what happened. You defended them both. You questioned my sanity rather than their integrity.&quot;<br/><br/>Her mother sank into a chair, her body shaking with sobs. Her father stood helplessly, his eyes revealing the truth he couldn&#x27;t bring himself to admit, that every word Camille spoke was accurate.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;ve lost everything,&quot; her mother whispered. &quot;Rose is gone. The family name is ruined. And now you... you won&#x27;t even give us a chance to make amends.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Some things can&#x27;t be fixed,&quot; Camille said, a hint of gentleness entering her voice despite her resolve to remain detached. &quot;Some betrayals cut too deep. This isn&#x27;t a Hollywood movie where the estranged family has a tearful reunion and everything is magically healed. Real life doesn&#x27;t work that way.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;So that&#x27;s it?&quot; her father asked, his voice breaking. &quot;Twenty six years of family just... erased? You&#x27;re throwing away your entire past?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;My past was already taken from me,&quot; Camille replied. &quot;The night I discovered my husband and sister had betrayed me. The night men attacked me in a parking garage and left me for dead. The night I realized my parents would never believe me over their precious Rose.&quot;<br/><br/>She moved back to her desk, signaling that the conversation was ending. &quot;I don&#x27;t hate you. I don&#x27;t wish you ill. I simply don&#x27;t have room in my new life for people who couldn&#x27;t love me as I deserved to be loved.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Please,&quot; her mother begged, rising from the chair. &quot;Just give us a chance. We can start over. We can do better.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s too late,&quot; Camille said, her voice final. &quot;I spent my entire life trying to earn your approval, your love. I&#x27;m done trying.&quot;<br/><br/>Her father approached the desk, his proud posture now bent with grief. &quot;What can we do? There must be something. Some way to reach you.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille looked at them both, these people who had given her life but failed to nurture her spirit, who had provided material comfort but withheld emotional security. For a moment, she felt a flicker of the old longing, the desperate need for their approval that had driven so many of her choices.<br/><br/>But that flicker died quickly, smothered by the memory of their betrayal.<br/><br/>&quot;There&#x27;s nothing you can do,&quot; she said softly. &quot;Except respect my wishes and leave me alone. Don&#x27;t call. Don&#x27;t visit. Don&#x27;t reach out through friends or colleagues. Consider Camille Lewis dead, because that&#x27;s what she is to me.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You can&#x27;t mean that,&quot; her mother whispered. &quot;We&#x27;re your parents. That bond can&#x27;t just be severed.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It already was,&quot; Camille replied. &quot;You severed it years ago, piece by piece, with every dismissal, every criticism, every time you chose Rose over me. I&#x27;m just acknowledging what has long been true.&quot;<br/><br/>Her father&#x27;s face hardened, his grief giving way to anger, his typical response when he couldn&#x27;t control a situation. &quot;So that&#x27;s it? After everything we&#x27;ve given you, everything we&#x27;ve sacrificed...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This isn&#x27;t about what you gave me,&quot; Camille interrupted, her voice sharp. &quot;It&#x27;s about what you didn&#x27;t give me. Protection. Trust. The benefit of the doubt. Unconditional love. The things parents are supposed to provide.&quot;<br/><br/>She pressed the intercom button. &quot;Rebecca, could you please come in? The Lewises are leaving.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You can&#x27;t dismiss us like employees,&quot; her father protested.<br/><br/>&quot;I can and I am.&quot; Camille stood firm, her resolve unshaken. &quot;I told you at the gala that our relationship was over. I meant it. The only reason I agreed to see you today was to make that absolutely clear.&quot;<br/><br/>Rebecca appeared at the door, her expression professionally neutral despite the obvious tension in the room.<br/><br/>&quot;Please escort Mr. and Mrs. Lewis to the lobby,&quot; Camille instructed.<br/><br/>&quot;Camille, please...&quot; her mother reached for her one last time.<br/><br/>&quot;Goodbye,&quot; Camille said firmly. &quot;I wish you well, but I don&#x27;t want you in my life. Not now. Not ever.&quot;<br/><br/>Her father&#x27;s face twisted with a mixture of grief and indignation. &quot;You&#x27;ll regret this. Someday, when you&#x27;re older, when you have children of your own,you&#x27;ll understand that family is all that matters in the end.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille met his gaze unflinchingly. &quot;You taught me exactly what family means, that it&#x27;s conditional, that love can be withdrawn if you don&#x27;t meet expectations, that blood ties don&#x27;t guarantee protection or support. It&#x27;s the most valuable lesson you ever gave me, and I won&#x27;t forget it.&quot;<br/><br/>Her mother let out a strangled sob as Rebecca gently guided them toward the door. Her father looked back once, his eyes filled with a pain Camille recognized all too well, the agony of rejection, of not being enough. She had lived with that pain her entire life.<br/><br/>When the door closed behind them, Camille remained standing, her body rigid with tension. She had expected to feel triumphant, or at least relieved. Instead, a hollow ache spread through her chest, not regret, exactly, but mourning for what could have been, for the parents they might have been in another life, for the daughter she might have been if they had truly loved her.<br/><br/>Outside, the storm intensified, rain lashing against the windows as if nature itself shared her turmoil. Camille watched the water blur the city lights, transforming them into smears of color against the darkness.<br/><br/>She had survived Rose&#x27;s betrayal. She had faced Stefan and sent him away. Now she had severed the last ties to her old life.<br/><br/>Camille Kane stood alone in her office, surrounded by the trappings of her new existence, the power, the prestige, the freedom to define herself on her own terms. She had won. She had reclaimed her life from those who had tried to destroy it.<br/><br/>Why, then, did victory taste so much like ash?<br/><br/>Her phone buzzed with a message from Victoria: &quot;Dinner tonight? We should celebrate your clean break.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille stared at the words, realizing that while she had lost one family, she had gained another, not perfect, not traditional, but hers by choice rather than blood.<br/><br/>&quot;Yes,&quot; she typed back. &quot;I&#x27;m ready to move forward.&quot;<br/><br/>And as the storm outside began to subside, Camille felt something shift within her, the first tentative release of a burden she had carried for too long. Not forgiveness, not yet. But perhaps, eventually, peace.<br/></div>
