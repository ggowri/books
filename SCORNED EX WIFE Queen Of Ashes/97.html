        <h1>Chapter 71-2</h1>
        <div><br/>&quot;I have resources that most people can&#x27;t imagine,&quot; Alexander said simply. &quot;My security team tracked you and Victoria leaving the cementry, after seeing the pictures i was relieved that you were alive.&quot;<br/><br/>Shock rippled through me. &quot;You knew? Before Victoria ever presented me as her daughter? Before the surgeries were complete?&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander nodded. &quot;I knew Victoria had found you. Saved you. Was helping you recover and transform. But I didn&#x27;t know why, or what you planned to do with your new identity.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;So all this time,&quot; I said slowly, trying to process what he was telling me, &quot;you&#x27;ve known exactly who I was. Even through the surgical changes. The new identity. Everything.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes,&quot; he admitted. &quot;From the beginning.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And you said nothing. For fifteen months.&quot; Anger briefly flared again. &quot;You watched me build this new life, plan my revenge, and said nothing.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What should I have said?&quot; Alexander asked quietly. &quot;When Victoria finally introduced you as her daughter, when you emerged with a new face and a new purpose, it was clear you&#x27;d chosen a specific path. It wasn&#x27;t my place to interfere with that choice.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Until you did interfere,&quot; I said, gesturing to the evidence on the table. &quot;Until you started manipulating events behind the scenes, helping destroy Rose and Stefan without my knowledge.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Not interfere,&quot; Alexander corrected gently. &quot;Support. Remove obstacles. Ensure your plan succeeded.&quot; He leaned forward, his eyes intent on mine. &quot;I saw what they did to you, Camille. Watched helplessly as your husband betrayed you with your sister. Learned what happened the night of your &#x27;assasination.&#x27; You deserved justice.&quot;<br/><br/>The raw sincerity in his voice made it impossible to maintain my anger. He had helped advance my revenge without seeking credit. Had used his considerable resources to ensure Rose and Stefan&#x27;s destruction without revealing his involvement until I discovered it myself.<br/><br/>&quot;Why come forward now?&quot; I asked. &quot;Why let me discover your involvement?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Because revenge is ending,&quot; Alexander said simply. &quot;Rose company is destroyed. Stefan&#x27;s shipping empire is in ruins. The justice you sought has largely been served.&quot;<br/><br/>He reached across the table, not quite touching me. &quot;And because I couldn&#x27;t bear to remain in the shadows any longer, watching you wonder what comes next without offering another possibility.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Which is?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;A future not defined by vengeance. By destruction.&quot; Alexander&#x27;s gaze held mine steadily. &quot;A future built on creation instead. On moving forward rather than looking back.&quot;<br/><br/>I studied him, this man who had known my true identity all along, who had silently supported my quest for justice without ever revealing his own connection to my past.<br/><br/>&quot;Why would you help me like this?&quot; I asked, needing to hear it directly. &quot;Commit resources, time, influence, all to help someone take revenge?&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s expression softened. &quot;Because five years ago, a stranger showed kindness to a broken man when no one else bothered. Because I watched from afar as that same woman&#x27;s life was torn apart by those who should have protected her. And because now, I find myself hoping she might allow me to be part of whatever she chooses to build next.&quot;<br/><br/>The simple sincerity in his voice broke through defenses I hadn&#x27;t even realized I&#x27;d constructed. For nineteen months, Victoria had been my only ally, her strategic brilliance guiding my transformation from victim to avenger. But Victoria&#x27;s help always came with calculation, with cost-benefit analysis, with emotional distance.<br/><br/>Alexander offered something different, support without agenda, alliance without conditions.<br/><br/>&quot;I don&#x27;t know what comes next,&quot; I admitted, surprised by my own vulnerability. &quot;For nineteen months, revenge has been my only purpose. I never planned for after.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Then perhaps we figure it out together,&quot; he suggested, his voice gentle. &quot;One day at a time.&quot;<br/><br/>As the last rays of sunlight faded from the sky, casting the room in soft shadows, I realized something had fundamentally shifted inside me. For  nineteen months, my world had contained only destruction, taking apart the lives of those who had taken mine. But sitting here, with Alexander&#x27;s quiet support, I glimpsed something I hadn&#x27;t dared imagine.<br/><br/>A future defined by what I might build, not what I had torn down.<br/><br/>&quot;Why now?&quot; I asked softly. &quot;Why reveal yourself at this moment?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Because I see you standing at a crossroads,&quot; Alexander replied. &quot;Victory achieved, revenge nearly complete. And I wanted you to know that when you decide what comes next, you won&#x27;t be facing it alone. Unless you want to be.&quot;<br/><br/>The offer hung between us, unspoken but clear. Partnership. Support. Perhaps something more, if I chose it.<br/><br/>&quot;Tell me more,&quot; I said softly, &quot;about this future you imagine.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s smile reached his eyes this time, warm and genuine. &quot;How about over dinner? I happen to know an excellent chef who prepares meals in that kitchen over there.&quot;<br/><br/>For the first time in longer than I could remember, I smiled without calculation, without strategy, without performance.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;d like that,&quot; I said. <br/><br/>As Alexander led me toward the kitchen, his hand lightly touching the small of my back, I realized I was taking my first step into the unknown territory of after.<br/></div>
