        <h1>Chapter 160-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 160<br/><br/>Dr. Sharma knocked twice before entering Victoria&#x27;s hospital room, her face unreadable as she carried a folder of test results. Camille sat up straighter in her chair, her heart speeding up. Two weeks had passed since Rose&#x27;s threatening message. Two weeks of heightened security, constant fear, and waiting for Victoria&#x27;s latest test results.<br/><br/>&quot;Good morning,&quot; Dr. Sharma said, her voice giving away nothing. &quot;How are you feeling today, Ms. Kane?&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria, sitting up in bed for the first time in days, nodded slightly. &quot;Better than yesterday. Less pain.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille studied her mother&#x27;s face, hardly daring to believe the small improvements she&#x27;d noticed over the past few days. The color returning to Victoria&#x27;s cheeks. The clarity in her eyes. The way she&#x27;d begun asking about Kane Industries again, as if planning for a future she might actually see.<br/><br/>Dr. Sharma pulled up the bedside chair and sat down, opening the folder on her lap. &quot;I have your latest scan results.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille reached for Victoria&#x27;s hand, bracing for bad news. They&#x27;d been through this routine before, brief improvements followed by crushing setbacks. Hope was a luxury she could barely afford.<br/><br/>&quot;The treatment is working,&quot; Dr. Sharma said, her professional mask finally breaking into a genuine smile. &quot;The tumors have shrunk by nearly thirty percent.&quot;<br/><br/>The words hung in the air. Camille stared at the doctor, afraid she&#x27;d misheard.<br/><br/>&quot;Thirty percent?&quot; Victoria repeated, her voice steadier than it had been in weeks.<br/><br/>&quot;Yes. Your body is responding remarkably well to the combined therapy approach.&quot; Dr. Sharma turned the folder, showing them the scan images. &quot;Here&#x27;s the primary tumor from three weeks ago. And here it is now.&quot;<br/><br/>Even to Camille&#x27;s untrained eye, the difference was clear. The dark mass that had been stealing Victoria&#x27;s life was noticeably smaller.<br/><br/>&quot;What does this mean?&quot; Camille asked, afraid to voice the real question burning in her heart: *Is she going to live?*<br/><br/>&quot;It means the treatment is working better than we expected,&quot; Dr. Sharma explained. &quot;Your mother&#x27;s body is fighting back with surprising strength.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s hand tightened around Camille&#x27;s. &quot;Give us the full picture, Doctor. No sugar-coating.&quot;<br/><br/>Dr. Sharma nodded, respecting Victoria&#x27;s directness. &quot;The cancer is still serious. But this response changes your prognosis significantly. With continued treatment and your current response rate, we could be looking at years of good quality life rather than months.&quot;<br/><br/>Years. The word echoed in Camille&#x27;s mind like a bell, clear and bright and almost too beautiful to believe.<br/><br/>&quot;And the smoke damage to her lungs?&quot; Camille pressed, needing to understand the complete situation.<br/><br/>&quot;Also improving faster than expected. Your mother has remarkable resilience, Ms. Kane.&quot; Dr. Sharma closed the folder. &quot;I believe we can start discussing discharge plans within the next week, with continued outpatient treatment, of course.&quot;<br/><br/>After the doctor left, promising to return with more details that afternoon, silence filled the room. Camille stared at Victoria, tears building behind her eyes but not falling.<br/><br/>&quot;Don&#x27;t look so shocked,&quot; Victoria said finally, a hint of her old dryness returning. &quot;I told you I wasn&#x27;t finished yet.&quot;<br/><br/>The simple statement broke the dam. Camille&#x27;s tears flowed freely now, her body shaking with sobs that were half laughter, half pure relief.<br/><br/>&quot;Camille,&quot; Victoria said, her voice softening. &quot;Come here.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille moved from the chair to the edge of the bed. Victoria reached up, wiping tears from her daughter&#x27;s cheeks with a gentleness few people had ever seen from the formidable businesswoman.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m not going anywhere,&quot; Victoria promised. &quot;Not for a long time.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I was so afraid,&quot; Camille admitted, the words barely audible. &quot;Every day, watching you get weaker. I thought...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I know what you thought.&quot; Victoria&#x27;s hand moved to cover Camille&#x27;s. &quot;I thought it too, at first. But it seems we&#x27;re both too stubborn to give up so easily.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille laughed through her tears. &quot;Stubborn enough to beat cancer and survive a bombing in the same month.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Exactly.&quot; Victoria&#x27;s eyes, clearer now than they had been in weeks, held Camille&#x27;s. &quot;Now, help me sit up properly. I need to make some calls.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Calls? You just got good news. You should rest.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ve been resting for weeks,&quot; Victoria countered. &quot;It&#x27;s time to start living again.&quot;<br/><br/>Something in those words reached deep inside Camille, touching a place that had been frozen with fear since Rose&#x27;s threat. *Time to start living again.* Not just surviving. Not just waiting for the next attack. But living, despite the dangers still lurking.<br/><br/>Camille adjusted Victoria&#x27;s pillows, helping her sit more upright. &quot;Alexander will want to know about the test results. He&#x27;s been worried too.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Of course he has,&quot; Victoria said. &quot;That young man loves you more than his own life. It makes him both valuable and extremely vulnerable.&quot;<br/><br/>The blunt assessment brought Camille up short. Even recovering from cancer, even celebrating good news, Victoria&#x27;s mind remained sharp, tactical, always evaluating weaknesses and strengths.<br/><br/>&quot;Rose is still out there,&quot; Victoria continued, reading Camille&#x27;s thoughts with her usual accuracy. &quot;My recovery doesn&#x27;t change that. If anything, it makes me a more tempting target.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The FBI is closing in,&quot; Camille reminded her. &quot;Every day they find new leads. It&#x27;s only a matter of time.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Perhaps. But Rose has always been patient when it suited her.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille stood, moving to the window where armed guards were visible patrolling the hospital grounds. &quot;I can&#x27;t live like this forever. None of us can. Looking over our shoulders. Jumping at shadows.&quot;</div>
