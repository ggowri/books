        <h1>Chapter 91-2</h1>
        <div><br/>&quot;As project head, she bears ultimate responsibility.&quot; Herod nodded. &quot;Particularly when evidence emerges that early tests showed potential problems..... problems she supposedly ignored.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Evidence you&#x27;ve manufactured,&quot; Rose guessed.<br/><br/>&quot;Already planted in Kane Industries&#x27; secure servers, timestamped months ago.&quot; Herod looked pleased with himself. &quot;When investigators dig, they&#x27;ll find exactly what we want them to find.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose felt her anger transforming, cooling into something harder and more focused. &quot;And the timing? After today&#x27;s disaster, they&#x27;ll be watching us more closely.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Which is why we let them believe they&#x27;ve won.&quot; Herod moved back to his chair. &quot;You disappear from public view. Retreat. Appear defeated. Let Kane Industries recover, let Camille bask in her vindication, let your parents think their betrayal saved their precious daughter.&quot;<br/><br/>He leaned forward. &quot;And then, just when they feel safest, everything collapses around them.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose stared at the floor, seeing not the scattered debris of her outburst but the future Herod described. Camille&#x27;s fall from grace. Victoria&#x27;s empire crumbling. Her parents watching helplessly as the daughter they chose suffered public disgrace.<br/><br/>&quot;How long?&quot; she asked finally.<br/><br/>&quot;Two months, perhaps three.&quot; Herod shrugged. &quot;Patience is essential.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And what about me? I can&#x27;t even leave this building without being mobbed.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You won&#x27;t need to for a while.&quot; Herod gestured toward the room beyond. &quot;The penthouse has everything you need. Food delivered. Private elevator. Security. Consider it a strategic retreat.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose stood, moving back to the window. Below, more reporters had gathered, their cameras pointed up at the building.<br/><br/>&quot;They think they&#x27;ve won,&quot; she said softly, pressing her palm against the cool glass. &quot;Camille. Victoria. Alexander. My parents. Even Stefan. They&#x27;re all celebrating right now, congratulating themselves on exposing me.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Let them celebrate,&quot; Herod said, coming to stand beside her. &quot;Victory makes people careless. And we need them careless.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose turned to him, something new hardening in her expression. &quot;Two months is a long time to wait for revenge.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Not compared to ten years.&quot; Herod&#x27;s voice carried the weight of his decade-long quest against Victoria. &quot;True revenge isn&#x27;t about immediate satisfaction. It&#x27;s about complete destruction. Taking everything from your enemy, not just their possessions, but their sense of security. Their trust in the world. Their belief in themselves.&quot;<br/><br/>His words resonated with something deep inside Rose, the part of her that had watched Camille from the shadows all these years, plotting, waiting, building toward the moment when she could take everything her sister had.<br/><br/>&quot;We move to phase two,&quot; she said finally, her decision made. &quot;But I have conditions.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod raised an eyebrow. &quot;Which are?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I want Camille to know it was me in the end. Not just suspect, but know with absolute certainty that I destroyed her again.&quot; Rose&#x27;s voice strengthened. &quot;And I want to be there when it happens. I want to see her face.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Risky,&quot; Herod noted. &quot;But possibly arrangeable.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And my parents,&quot; Rose continued. &quot;They don&#x27;t just lose social standing. They lose everything. The house. Their money. Their reputations.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Collateral damage is expected in war,&quot; Herod agreed smoothly.<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s mind cleared, her earlier rage transforming into cold determination. &quot;And Stefan. I want him ruined most of all. He betrayed me after everything I did for him. Everything I sacrificed.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Your priorities seem somewhat tangled,&quot; Herod observed. &quot;I thought Camille was your main target.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;They all are,&quot; Rose said simply. &quot;Different branches of the same tree. Cut them all down, burn the roots, salt the earth.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod studied her with new interest. &quot;You continue to surprise me, Rose. Most people underestimate the depths of your... commitment.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Most people underestimate me entirely,&quot; she replied. &quot;It&#x27;s what makes them so easy to manipulate.&quot;<br/><br/>She looked around at the destroyed room, suddenly embarrassed by her earlier loss of control. &quot;I apologize for the mess. I&#x27;ll have it cleaned up.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Don&#x27;t bother.&quot; Herod dismissed her concern with a wave. &quot;It&#x27;s just things. Replaceable.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Unlike reputations,&quot; Rose added, a thin smile forming. &quot;Those, once truly broken, never quite recover.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod moved to his desk and pressed an intercom button. &quot;Jackson, have the penthouse cleaned. And inform the security team downstairs that no press is to be allowed into the building under any circumstances.&quot;<br/><br/>He released the button and turned back to Rose. &quot;Phase two requires preparation. We should begin immediately.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose nodded, the last embers of her rage cooling into resolve. The initial plan had failed, yes. But the war was far from over. Camille had survived the first attack, just as she had survived the parking garage. But this time, Rose wouldn&#x27;t make the same mistake.<br/><br/>This time, she would destroy Camille so completely that no amount of support from Victoria Kane or Alexander Pierce could save her.<br/><br/>&quot;What do we do first?&quot; she asked.<br/><br/>Herod smiled, pleased by her renewed focus. &quot;First, we disappear. Let the world think you&#x27;ve been defeated. Let them lower their guard.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And then?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Then we strip away everything Camille values.... piece by piece. Her new identity. Her position at Kane Industries. Her relationship with Alexander. Her precious Phoenix Grid.&quot; His voice hardened. &quot;By the time we&#x27;re finished, she&#x27;ll wish she had died in that parking garage.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose moved to the bar and poured herself a proper drink, leaving behind the half-empty wine bottle of her earlier frenzy. The smooth burn of whiskey steadied her as she raised her glass.<br/><br/>&quot;To phase two,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;And to complete destruction.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod clinked his glass against hers. &quot;To patience. And to perfect timing.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose sipped her whiskey, letting the warmth spread through her chest. The day&#x27;s humiliation still stung, but Herod was right. Emotion was a liability in a game like this. Cool heads prevailed. Patient predators caught their prey.<br/><br/>And Rose Lewis was nothing if not patient when it came to destroying her sister.<br/></div>
