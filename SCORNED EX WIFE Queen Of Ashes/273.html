        <h1>Chapter 174-2</h1>
        <div><br/>Victoria stood and walked to the windows, needing the movement to order her thoughts. <br/><br/>&quot;When I thought I was dying imminently,&quot; she said, &quot;I made certain decisions about my legacy. About Kane Industries. About you.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille remained silent, waiting.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ve spent decades building this company,&quot; Victoria continued. &quot;Every waking hour dedicated to making it stronger, larger, more profitable. More mine.&quot; She turned to face Camille. &quot;I thought I would die with my hand still on the controls.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And now?&quot; Camille asked softly.<br/><br/>&quot;Now I find I don&#x27;t want that ending, even if it&#x27;s delayed.&quot; Victoria returned to her desk and opened a drawer. From it, she withdrew a thick document bound in leather. &quot;This is my revised will and succession plan for Kane Industries.&quot;<br/><br/>She pushed it across the desk toward Camille, who made no move to take it.<br/><br/>&quot;Open it,&quot; Victoria directed.<br/><br/>Camille carefully lifted the cover, her eyes scanning the first page. Her breath caught as she read.<br/><br/>&quot;You&#x27;re stepping down?&quot; she asked, looking up sharply. &quot;Effective immediately?&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria nodded once. &quot;I&#x27;m stepping back from daily operations. I&#x27;ll retain my place on the board, but yes, I&#x27;m stepping down as CEO.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;But why now? Especially with your health improving...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s precisely why,&quot; Victoria cut in. &quot;I&#x27;ve been given time I didn&#x27;t expect to have. I don&#x27;t intend to spend it in board meetings and conference calls.&quot;<br/><br/>She reached across the desk and turned several pages in the document. &quot;Keep reading.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille&#x27;s eyes widened further as she scanned the text. &quot;You&#x27;re naming me as your successor. And your heir.&quot; She looked up again, momentarily speechless. &quot;Everything? The company, your estate, all of it?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; Victoria&#x27;s tone allowed no argument. &quot;You&#x27;ve proven yourself worthy of it, in every way that matters. The board will resist, of course. They&#x27;ll say you&#x27;re too young, too inexperienced.&quot; A thin smile crossed her face. &quot;They once said the same about me.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I don&#x27;t know what to say,&quot; Camille whispered.<br/><br/>&quot;Say you&#x27;ll accept.&quot; Victoria&#x27;s voice softened slightly. &quot;Say you&#x27;ll take what I built and make it your own, as you were meant to.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille stood and walked to the window, needing space to process the magnitude of what Victoria was offering. When she turned back, her face showed not just gratitude but understanding.<br/><br/>&quot;This isn&#x27;t just about me, is it?&quot; she asked. &quot;It&#x27;s about what you want for yourself.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria felt a flicker of surprise at being so transparently read. &quot;Perhaps.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille smiled. &quot;What will you do? With these years you&#x27;ve been given?&quot;<br/><br/>For the first time in their conversation, Victoria smiled fully. &quot;Whatever I want. Travel, perhaps. See the places I&#x27;ve only visited for business. Read books that aren&#x27;t financial reports.&quot; She looked again at Sophia&#x27;s photograph. &quot;Make peace with old ghosts.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You&#x27;ve earned it,&quot; Camille said simply.<br/><br/>Victoria studied the young woman before her, once broken, now rebuilt into something stronger than before. Her greatest project, in many ways. And her greatest gift to the world.<br/><br/>&quot;I built this company to prove something,&quot; Victoria said, more to herself than to Camille. &quot;To prove I was strong enough, smart enough, ruthless enough. I no longer need that proof.&quot;<br/><br/>She pressed a button on her desk, and her assistant entered with a tray of tea. The ritual of pouring gave Victoria a moment to collect herself. When they each held a cup, she raised hers in a small toast.<br/><br/>&quot;To unexpected time,&quot; she said.<br/><br/>&quot;And making it count,&quot; Camille added.<br/><br/>They drank in companionable silence. Outside, the afternoon light began to shift toward evening, painting Manhattan&#x27;s skyline in shades of gold.<br/><br/>&quot;The press will speculate wildly, of course,&quot; Victoria said finally. &quot;About my health, about why I&#x27;m stepping down.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Let them,&quot; Camille replied. &quot;We know the truth.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria nodded, satisfied with the answer. &quot;The announcement goes out tomorrow. Frederick has prepared statements for both of us.&quot; She paused. &quot;Are you ready for this?&quot;<br/><br/>Camille didn&#x27;t answer immediately. When she did, her voice held the quiet certainty Victoria had come to respect. &quot;I&#x27;ve been preparing for it. Thanks to you.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria allowed herself another small smile. &quot;Then it&#x27;s decided.&quot;<br/><br/>She stood and walked once more to the windows, gazing out at the city that had demanded so much and given so much in return. Behind her, she heard Camille set down her teacup.<br/><br/>&quot;Will you tell me something honestly?&quot; Camille asked.<br/><br/>Victoria turned, curious. &quot;If I can.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Are you afraid? Of letting go?&quot;<br/><br/>The question struck deeper than Victoria had expected. Was she afraid? This company had been her identity, her purpose, her reason for waking each morning. Without it, who was Victoria Kane?<br/><br/>&quot;Yes,&quot; she admitted, surprising herself with the truth. &quot;But I&#x27;m more afraid of wasting this gift I&#x27;ve been given.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded, understanding. &quot;You once asked me what comes after revenge. After you&#x27;ve won all your battles and secured your position.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I remember,&quot; Victoria said. &quot;I didn&#x27;t have an answer then.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And now?&quot; Camille asked.<br/><br/>Victoria looked out at the city one more time, then back to the woman who would inherit her legacy. &quot;Now I intend to find out.&quot;<br/></div>
