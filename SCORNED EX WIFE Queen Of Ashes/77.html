        <h1>Chapter 59-2</h1>
        <div><br/>&quot;I know exactly what it is.&quot; Three years I&#x27;d lived in that mansion as Stefan&#x27;s wife. Three years of trying to please his family, of attempting to belong in spaces where I was merely tolerated. Three years of memories now tainted by betrayal. &quot;Sterling Trust will sell the note if the offer is generous enough.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;May I ask why? The estate has no strategic value to Kane Industries.&quot;<br/><br/>The question deserved a business answer, a rational explanation. Something that would make sense in tomorrow&#x27;s executive briefing when Victoria questioned this decision.<br/><br/>Instead, I gave the truth. &quot;Because it will hurt him more than losing the company. Because the Rodriguez estate represents five generations of family history. Because it&#x27;s the one thing Stefan believes can never be taken from him.&quot;<br/><br/>Understanding dawned in Rebecca&#x27;s eyes, not judgment, not concern, just recognition of the personal motivation driving these business decisions. Victoria had trained her well to accept without questioning.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ll make the calls immediately,&quot; she said, moving toward the door.<br/><br/>Once Rebecca had gone, I moved to the hidden wall safe behind my office artwork. Inside, nestled beside the diamond necklace Alexander had given me, lay a small photo album, one of the few possessions I&#x27;d kept from my life as Camille Lewis. I removed it carefully, opening to the last pages.<br/><br/>My wedding to Stefan. Me in an ivory gown his mother had selected because &quot;white would wash out your complexion, dear.&quot; Him handsome in his tuxedo, the smile that had once seemed genuine now revealed as the empty gesture it had always been.<br/><br/>Rose stood beside me in the photos, maid of honor in a dress carefully chosen to outshine the bride. Her arm around my waist, her smile perfect, her eyes already calculating how to take what wasn&#x27;t hers.<br/><br/>I slammed the album shut, returning it to the safe before the memories could weaken my resolve. This wasn&#x27;t about pain anymore, wasn&#x27;t about heartbreak or betrayal. This was about justice. About consequences for actions carelessly taken. About making Stefan understand exactly what he had done when he signed those divorce papers on our anniversary.<br/><br/>My phone buzzed with a text from Victoria: *Heard about the Rodriguez rejection. Your next steps?*<br/><br/>I replied quickly: *Acquiring all debt through bank purchases. Foreclosing immediately. Taking the family estate as well.*<br/><br/>Her response came instantly, approval evident even in text form: *Excellent. Total control rather than partial acquisition. More thorough destruction.*<br/><br/>I set the phone down, strangely unsettled by her enthusiasm. Once, her approval had been everything I sought. Her strategic guidance the foundation of my reborn existence. Her careful mentoring the framework for my transformation from victim to avenger.<br/><br/>But recently, something had shifted. Some small, persistent voice questioning whether Victoria&#x27;s vision of justice through complete destruction was truly what I wanted. Whether becoming as cold and calculating as those who had hurt me was really victory at all.<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s words floated back to me: &quot;The phoenix rises not just from ashes, but toward something greater.&quot;<br/><br/>I pushed the thought away. Now wasn&#x27;t the time for doubt. For questioning the path I&#x27;d followed for sixteen months. Stefan had rejected the lifeline I&#x27;d offered, insulting though it had been. Had chosen family pride over practical survival. Had demonstrated once again the arrogance that had defined our marriage.<br/><br/>My phone buzzed again, Alexander, not accepting my assistant&#x27;s message as final.<br/><br/>*The phoenix makes her choice. Today revenge, perhaps tomorrow something more. When you&#x27;re ready to discuss possibilities beyond Victoria&#x27;s script, I&#x27;ll be waiting.*<br/><br/>I started to delete the message, then stopped, rereading his words. How did he always seem to know my thoughts? To understand the conflict beneath my carefully maintained exterior?<br/><br/>More importantly, how did he know about Victoria&#x27;s &quot;script&quot;? About her careful orchestration of my revenge? About the plan we&#x27;d developed together over sixteen months of meticulous preparation?<br/><br/>The questions added to my unease, to the growing sense that Alexander Pierce knew far more about me than should be possible. That he somehow saw beyond the surgical alterations and behavioral training to the woman beneath.<br/><br/>To the woman I sometimes feared no longer existed.<br/><br/>Tomorrow would bring the next phase of Stefan&#x27;s destruction. The irrevocable foreclosure on his family&#x27;s shipping empire. The beginning of the end for the Rodriguez legacy.<br/><br/>But somewhere beneath my fury at his rejection, beneath my determination to make him suffer as I had suffered, a small voice whispered uncomfortable questions.<br/><br/>What happens after revenge is complete? Who will you be when hatred no longer defines your purpose? What rises from ashes when the fire finally burns out?<br/><br/>Questions I pushed aside, focusing instead on the justice tomorrow would bring. On the satisfaction of watching Stefan finally understand what it meant to lose everything that mattered.<br/><br/>On the moment when he would finally pay the debt he owed for destroying Camille Lewis without a second thought.<br/></div>
