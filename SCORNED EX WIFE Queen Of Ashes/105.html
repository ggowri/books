        <h1>Chapter 76-1</h1>
        <div> Chapter 76<br/><br/>The lobby of Kane Industries gleamed with polished marble and sleek glass. Camille stepped out of the elevator on the top floor, her heels clicking against the floor as she walked toward her office. Three days had passed since the Phoenix Gala, and her mind still buzzed with the memory of Rose&#x27;s face as the truth was revealed, the shock on Stefan&#x27;s features, the horror in her parents&#x27; eyes.<br/><br/>Now the world knew who she really was. The media couldn&#x27;t get enough of the story: the supposedly dead wife who had returned as a powerful executive, the systematic destruction of her ex-husband&#x27;s company and her sister&#x27;s reputation. Some painted her as a victim-turned-hero, others as a manipulative schemer. Camille didn&#x27;t care which version they believed.<br/><br/>She pushed open the glass door to her office and stopped short. A massive arrangement of white roses sat on her desk, their scent filling the room. A knot formed in her stomach. She knew who they were from before she even read the card.<br/><br/>&quot;Ms. Kane,&quot; her assistant Rebecca said from behind her, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry. He sent them before I arrived this morning. Security checked them thoroughly.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded, finding her voice. &quot;It&#x27;s fine, Rebecca. Could you please take them away? Donate them to the hospital across the street.&quot;<br/><br/>Rebecca quickly removed the flowers while Camille settled at her desk, turning her attention to the documents awaiting her signature. She had just begun reviewing the first contract when Rebecca&#x27;s voice came through the intercom.<br/><br/>&quot;Ms. Kane, Stefan Rodriguez is in the lobby requesting to see you. Security wants to know if they should turn him away.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille&#x27;s pen stilled above the paper. She had expected this, of course. It was only a matter of time before he would try to reach out. Still, her heart hammered uncomfortably against her ribs.<br/><br/>&quot;Tell them to send him up,&quot; she said after a moment. &quot;And Rebecca, please stay close by. If I need you, I&#x27;ll call.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Of course, Ms. Kane.&quot;<br/><br/>Five minutes later, Stefan stood in her doorway. He looked awful, shadows beneath his eyes, his normally perfect suit slightly rumpled, his face drawn with exhaustion. There was a time when seeing him like this would have torn at her heart, when she would have done anything to comfort him.<br/><br/>Now she just felt... nothing.<br/><br/>&quot;Come in and close the door,&quot; she said, gesturing to the chair across from her desk. She remained standing, unwilling to cede even that small advantage.<br/><br/>Stefan stepped inside, his eyes never leaving her face. &quot;Camille,&quot; he breathed, his voice cracking on her name. &quot;I still can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s really you.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It isn&#x27;t,&quot; she replied coolly. &quot;Not the woman you knew, anyway.&quot;<br/><br/>He flinched at her tone, then moved closer, stopping when she held up a hand. &quot;Please, Camille. I just want to talk. I&#x27;ve been going crazy since the gala. I can&#x27;t sleep, I can&#x27;t eat....&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What do you want, Stefan?&quot; Camille cut him off, her voice steady despite the storm inside her. &quot;Why are you here?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I needed to see you.&quot; He ran a hand through his hair, leaving it slightly disheveled in a way that once would have made her heart skip. &quot;To explain...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Explain what? How you cheated on me with my sister? How you lied to my face for months? How you were willing to throw away our marriage for someone who never even truly cared about you?&quot; The words spilled out, sharper than she intended, cutting through the professional demeanor she had tried to maintain.<br/><br/>&quot;I was a fool,&quot; Stefan said, his eyes filling with tears. &quot;I was blind and stupid and selfish. Rose... she manipulated me, fed me lies about you, about us...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Stop.&quot; Camille raised her hand again. &quot;Don&#x27;t blame Rose for your choices. You weren&#x27;t hypnotized. You weren&#x27;t drugged. You looked me in the eye and lied to me for months. That was all you.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan seemed to collapse within himself, sinking into the chair. &quot;You&#x27;re right. I&#x27;m not trying to escape responsibility. What I did was unforgivable.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And yet here you are, seeking forgiveness.&quot; Camille finally sat down, keeping her desk between them like a shield.<br/><br/>&quot;Not just forgiveness.&quot; Stefan leaned forward, his eyes suddenly burning with intensity. &quot;A second chance. Camille, I never stopped loving you. Even with Rose, even after I thought you were gone... there was always something missing. It was you. It&#x27;s always been you.&quot;<br/><br/>A bitter laugh escaped her throat. &quot;Are you serious? You think after everything you&#x27;ve done, everything that&#x27;s happened, we could just... what? Get back together? Resume our marriage like none of this ever occurred?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Not right away, of course,&quot; Stefan rushed to say. &quot;I know it would take time, years maybe. But we could start over. I could prove to you that I&#x27;ve changed, that I understand what I threw away.&quot; He reached across the desk, trying to take her hand, but she moved it away. &quot;Camille, please. The company, the money, none of that matters. I&#x27;d give up everything just for the chance to make things right with you.&quot;</div>
