        <h1>Chapter 91-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 91<br/><br/>The crystal vase shattered against the wall, water and roses exploding across the cream-colored paint. Rose grabbed the next item within reach, a heavy silver photo frame and hurled it at the television where her parents&#x27; faces still filled the screen.<br/><br/>&quot;Liars!&quot; she screamed, her voice raw. &quot;Filthy, worthless liars!&quot;<br/><br/>The frame cracked the television screen, splitting her father&#x27;s image in two before the picture went black.<br/><br/>Rose stood in the middle of Herod&#x27;s penthouse living room, chest heaving, hair wild around her face. The elegant space lay in ruins around her, furniture overturned, glass broken, papers scattered across the floor. Her hands trembled with rage as she searched for something else to destroy.<br/><br/>&quot;Fourteen years!&quot; She kicked over a side table, sending a lamp crashing to the floor. &quot;Fourteen years playing the perfect daughter! The supportive sister! And they throw it away for her?&quot;<br/><br/>She grabbed a leather-bound book and tore it in half, pages fluttering around her like wounded birds.<br/><br/>&quot;After everything I did to make them love me! After everything I endured in that house, pretending to be grateful, pretending to belong!&quot;<br/><br/>Her voice broke on the last word, anger momentarily giving way to something darker and more painful. She pressed her hands against her eyes, willing away the burning tears.<br/><br/>Behind her, the elevator doors opened silently. Herod Preston stepped into the chaos, surveying the destruction with raised eyebrows.<br/><br/>&quot;I take it you&#x27;ve seen the press conference,&quot; he said dryly.<br/><br/>Rose whirled toward him, eyes blazing. &quot;Did you know? Did you know they would do this?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;If I had known your parents would suddenly develop backbones, I would have taken preventive measures.&quot; Herod carefully stepped over broken glass, making his way to the bar. &quot;The timing is... unfortunate.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Unfortunate?&quot; Rose laughed, the sound harsh and brittle. &quot;They&#x27;ve ruined everything! My parents, who I controlled for years. Stefan, who I owned completely. All of them turning against me for Camille!&quot;<br/><br/>She grabbed a half-empty bottle of wine and drank directly from it, red liquid spilling down her chin.<br/><br/>&quot;And those journals! Those damned journals I thought I&#x27;d destroyed!&quot; She slammed the bottle down. &quot;How did they get them? How did they know what to say? Someone helped them. Someone gave them information.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod poured himself a whiskey, seemingly unbothered by her outburst. &quot;Alexander Pierce, most likely. He&#x27;s been surprisingly resourceful.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I want him destroyed too,&quot; Rose hissed, pacing like a caged animal. &quot;Him, Camille, Victoria, my parents, Stefan, all of them. I want them to suffer for this humiliation.&quot;<br/><br/>She paused by the window, staring down at the street where reporters had gathered outside the building. News of her parents&#x27; accusations had spread quickly, drawing media vultures hoping to catch her reaction.<br/><br/>&quot;I can&#x27;t even leave,&quot; she whispered, a new note of panic entering her voice. &quot;They&#x27;re waiting for me down there. Cameras. Questions. All those people who believed me yesterday, now looking at me like I&#x27;m a monster.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod watched her, swirling his drink thoughtfully. &quot;Sit down, Rose.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I don&#x27;t want to sit!&quot; she snapped. &quot;I want to...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Sit. Down.&quot; His voice hardened, the casual facade dropping momentarily.<br/><br/>Something in his tone cut through her rage. Rose sank onto the edge of a chair, shoulders still rigid with fury.<br/><br/>Herod took the seat across from her. &quot;Do you know why most revenge plots fail?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I don&#x27;t need a lecture,&quot; she seethed.<br/><br/>&quot;Emotion,&quot; he continued as if she hadn&#x27;t spoken. &quot;Uncontrolled emotion leads to mistakes. Mistakes lead to failure.&quot; He sipped his whiskey. &quot;What&#x27;s happening right now is you losing control.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;They betrayed me!&quot; Rose&#x27;s fists clenched on her knees. &quot;My own parents. Stefan. After everything...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes, yes, they&#x27;re terrible people.&quot; Herod waved his hand dismissively. &quot;The question is not whether you have the right to be angry. The question is whether your anger serves our purpose.&quot;<br/><br/>His calm only infuriated her further. &quot;How can you sit there so coldly? Kane Industries stock is recovering. Camille&#x27;s reputation is being restored. Everything we worked for—&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Is a minor setback,&quot; Herod cut in. &quot;One battle in a larger war.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose laughed bitterly. &quot;Easy for you to say. You&#x27;re not the one they&#x27;re calling a liar and manipulator on every news channel. Your life isn&#x27;t being torn apart in public.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No,&quot; Herod agreed, something flashing in his eyes. &quot;That happened to me ten years ago, when Victoria Kane systematically destroyed my family. I know exactly how public humiliation feels.&quot;<br/><br/>He set his glass down carefully. &quot;The difference is that I channeled that feeling into something productive. A plan. A purpose. Not...&quot; he gestured at the destroyed room, &quot;this childish tantrum.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose flinched as if he&#x27;d slapped her.<br/><br/>&quot;Now,&quot; Herod continued, &quot;we have two choices. We can abandon our efforts because of this setback, or we can accelerate to phase two.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose drew a shaky breath, struggling to pull herself together. &quot;What exactly is phase two? You&#x27;ve been vague about the details.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Because until now, you didn&#x27;t need to know them.&quot; Herod stood and moved to his desk, retrieving a tablet from the drawer. &quot;The Phoenix Grid project breaks ground in two weeks. The site is prepared, construction crews ready, permits secured.&quot;<br/><br/>He handed her the tablet, open to technical specifications. &quot;These are the modified blueprints for the power distribution nodes. Our contact inside Kane Engineering has already substituted them for the originals.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose stared at the diagrams, not understanding the technical aspects but recognizing the importance of what she was seeing. &quot;So the project will fail?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Not immediately,&quot; Herod said, a thin smile appearing. &quot;The system will operate perfectly during the demonstration and initial testing. The flaws will only manifest under full load conditions, approximately six to eight weeks after installation.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And when it fails?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Catastrophically.&quot; He took the tablet back. &quot;Not dangerous to human life, I&#x27;m not that reckless, but catastrophic from a business perspective. Complete system failure across multiple cities simultaneously. Hundreds of millions in damages. Stock collapse. Regulatory investigations.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s breathing slowed as she absorbed his words. &quot;And Camille takes the blame.&quot;</div>
