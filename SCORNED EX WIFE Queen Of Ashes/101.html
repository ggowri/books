        <h1>Chapter 74-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 74<br/><br/>The ballroom fell silent as Camille stepped onto the stage. The crystal chandeliers above cast a glow that seemed to highlight her transformation, her posture straight and confident, her chin raised, her eyes clear and focused. Gone was the woman who had once shrunk herself to make others comfortable. In her place stood someone new, someone forged in fire.<br/><br/>She took the microphone from Victoria, her fingers steady despite the hundreds of wide eyes fixed on her. Whispers rippled through the crowd: &quot;It can&#x27;t be...&quot; &quot;She&#x27;s dead...&quot; &quot;How is this possible?&quot;<br/><br/>The faces that mattered most to her stood frozen in shock. Her mother clutched her father&#x27;s arm, her mouth hanging open. Stefan had gone deathly pale, as if seeing a ghost. And Rose.... Rose&#x27;s face had drained of color, her perfectly manicured nails digging into her palms.<br/><br/>&quot;Thank you all for coming tonight,&quot; Camille began, her voice carrying across the stunned silence. &quot;Some of you knew me as Camille Lewis. Others have come to know me as Camille Kane. The truth is, I am both.&quot;<br/><br/>She paused, allowing her words to sink in. Camera phones were raised throughout the ballroom, recording every moment. This was not just a private revelation; it would become public knowledge within minutes.<br/><br/>&quot;Eighteen months ago, I discovered divorce papers on my anniversary. My husband, Stefan Rodriguez...&quot; she gestured toward him, and the crowd&#x27;s eyes followed &quot;.....had decided our marriage was over because he had fallen in love with my sister, Rose.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan flinched visibly, taking a half-step back as if trying to disappear into the crowd.<br/><br/>&quot;What I didn&#x27;t know then was that this wasn&#x27;t a recent development. You see, Rose and Stefan had a relationship for years before I ever met him. I was simply a placeholder, a convenient detour on their path to being together.&quot;<br/><br/>Gasps echoed through the ballroom. Camille took a slow breath, centering herself. She would not rush through this moment she had prepared for so long.<br/><br/>&quot;On the night I signed those divorce papers, something inside me broke. I thought I had lost everything. Little did I know that loss was just the beginning.&quot;<br/><br/>She looked directly at Rose now, whose face had shifted from shock to something darker, a mixture of rage and fear.<br/><br/>&quot;After I left, I was attacked in a parking garage. Men who were hired to deliver a message. They beat me until I could barely stand. They told me to leave New York and never come back, that I wouldn&#x27;t survive a second warning.&quot;<br/><br/>Her mother let out a low moan, covering her mouth with trembling hands.<br/><br/>&quot;I would have died that night if Victoria Kane hadn&#x27;t found me.&quot; Camille turned to Victoria, who stood like a sentinel at the side of the stage. &quot;She saved me, not just by stopping the attackers, but by showing me that I could transform my pain into power.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria gave her a subtle nod, her face showing rare public emotion.<br/><br/>&quot;The question, of course, is who would want me gone so badly? Who would pay to have me attacked? Who would benefit most from my disappearance?&quot;<br/><br/>All eyes shifted to Rose, who had begun to back away, looking for an exit.<br/><br/>&quot;Rose Lewis arranged my murder,&quot; Camille stated, her voice cutting through the room like a blade. &quot;My sister, the person who claimed to love me, orchestrated an attack meant to frighten me into leaving or.... if necessary... ensure I never spoke again.&quot;<br/><br/>The crowd erupted in murmurs. Security guards subtly moved to block the exits.<br/><br/>&quot;I have evidence,&quot; Camille continued once the noise died down. &quot;Bank transfers, phone records, testimony from the men who were hired. Everything has been provided to the district attorney&#x27;s office.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose lunged forward suddenly, her mask of sophistication entirely gone. &quot;You lying bitch!&quot; she screamed, her voice raw with fury. &quot;You had everything! Everything was handed to you while I had to fight for scraps!&quot;<br/><br/>Security moved toward Rose, but Camille raised a hand to stop them. This confrontation had been years in the making. She wouldn&#x27;t cut it short now.<br/><br/>&quot;I never wanted to hurt you,&quot; Camille said, keeping her voice steady. &quot;But you plotted against me my entire life. You manipulated everyone around me. You took joy in my pain.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I only wanted what should have been mine!&quot; Rose shouted, tears streaming down her face now, smearing her perfect makeup. &quot;Do you know what it&#x27;s like to watch someone else live the life you deserved? I was the one who fought my way out of foster care! I was the one who clawed my way into this family! And you.... you were always the favorite, the precious daughter, while I was just the charity case they took in!&quot;<br/><br/>The ballroom was utterly silent now, the crowd watching the scene unfold with horrified fascination.<br/><br/>&quot;So yes, I arranged for those men to scare you,&quot; Rose continued, past caring about the consequences of her confession. &quot;You were supposed to run away, not die. And when your car was pulled from the river, I thought....&quot; She stopped abruptly, realizing what she was admitting.<br/><br/>&quot;You thought your plan had worked too well,&quot; Camille finished for her. &quot;You thought I was dead, and you celebrated while pretending to mourn.&quot;<br/><br/>Her mother stepped forward then, her face ashen. &quot;Rose... tell me this isn&#x27;t true. Tell me you didn&#x27;t try to hurt your sister.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s laugh was hollow. &quot;Sister? She was never my sister. She was an obstacle, a roadblock standing between me and everything I wanted.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And what exactly did you want, Rose?&quot; Camille asked, though she already knew the answer.</div>
