        <h1>Chapter 134-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 134<br/><br/>Camille&#x27;s penthouse glowed with warm light against the evening sky. Floor-to-ceiling windows displayed the city below, where thousands of lights now powered by the Phoenix Grid sparkled like earthbound stars. The dining table, set for twelve, gleamed with crystal and silver.<br/><br/>Hannah arrived first, bringing a bottle of champagne and a shy smile. She looked different outside the control room—softer somehow in a simple blue dress, her usual ponytail replaced by loose waves.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s strange to celebrate,&quot; she said as Camille welcomed her. &quot;Part of me is still waiting for another crisis.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille squeezed her hand. &quot;Tonight, we just enjoy our success.&quot;<br/><br/>The others arrived in quick succession, Mike from Hannah&#x27;s team, board members who had supported the Grid from the beginning, Alexander&#x27;s chief engineer who had helped design the power relays. Each brought congratulations, small gifts, happy exhaustion from the work finally completed.<br/><br/>Camille moved among them easily, the perfect hostess, but her eyes kept drifting to the door. When the bell rang again, she hurried to answer it herself.<br/><br/>Her parents stood in the hallway, looking uncertain. Her mother clutched a small gift bag. Her father shifted from foot to foot like a schoolboy called to the principal&#x27;s office.<br/><br/>&quot;You came,&quot; Camille said, surprising herself with the relief in her voice.<br/><br/>&quot;We wouldn&#x27;t miss it,&quot; her mother replied. &quot;Your moment of triumph.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille stepped back to let them enter. Their relationship remained fragile, a delicate bridge being rebuilt one careful board at a time. But they had come. That mattered.<br/><br/>The door opened once more, and Victoria swept in with her usual regal presence. She wore deep blue tonight instead of her usual silver gray, perhaps her own small acknowledgment that this evening marked something new.<br/><br/>&quot;The Grid is performing above all projections,&quot; she announced as her greeting. &quot;The mayor called personally to congratulate us.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille smiled. Even in celebration, Victoria remained focused on the work.<br/><br/>Alexander was the last to arrive, apologizing for his lateness, bringing a case of rare wine. His eyes found Camille immediately across the room, a private message passing between them. Tonight was the night they would finally share their secret.<br/><br/>Dinner began with light conversation about the Grid&#x27;s successful launch, newspaper headlines, congratulatory calls from around the world. The food, prepared by Camille herself, drew appreciative comments.<br/><br/>&quot;I didn&#x27;t know you could cook,&quot; her father said, surprise in his voice.<br/><br/>&quot;There&#x27;s a lot you don&#x27;t know about me,&quot; Camille replied, not unkindly. Just a statement of fact.<br/><br/>Her mother looked down at her plate. &quot;We&#x27;re trying to learn.&quot;<br/><br/>Hannah, sensing tension, quickly changed the subject to the Grid&#x27;s performance metrics, drawing the table into technical discussion that carried them through the main course.<br/><br/>As dessert was served, Alexander stood, tapping his glass gently. The room quieted, all eyes turning to him.<br/><br/>&quot;I want to propose a toast,&quot; he began. &quot;To the Phoenix Grid and its brilliant creator, Camille Kane.&quot;<br/><br/>Glasses raised around the table. Camille felt warmth rise to her cheeks.<br/><br/>&quot;But,&quot; Alexander continued, &quot;I also have an announcement to make.&quot; He looked at Camille, a question in his eyes. She nodded, her heart suddenly racing.<br/><br/>He reached for her hand, drawing her to stand beside him. &quot;A few days ago, I asked Camille a question. A very important question.&quot; His voice filled with emotion. &quot;And she said yes.&quot;<br/><br/>For a moment, confusion showed on some faces. Then understanding dawned as Camille raised her left hand, the phoenix ring catching the light.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;re engaged,&quot; she said simply.<br/><br/>The table erupted in surprised delight. Hannah squealed and jumped up to hug Camille. Victoria showed no surprise—she had known, of course—but satisfaction played at the corners of her mouth.<br/><br/>Camille looked toward her parents. Her mother&#x27;s eyes shone with tears. Her father seemed frozen, processing this unexpected news.<br/><br/>&quot;When?&quot; Mike asked. &quot;How long have you been keeping this secret?&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander smiled. &quot;I proposed the day before the Grid launch. We wanted to wait until after the activation to share our news.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;So all those rumors about you two were true,&quot; Hannah&#x27;s assistant said. &quot;The tabloids had it right for once.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Not quite,&quot; Camille corrected. &quot;They knew we were together. They didn&#x27;t know about this.&quot; She wiggled her fingers, making the diamond sparkle.<br/><br/>Her mother approached cautiously. &quot;May I?&quot; she asked, reaching for Camille&#x27;s hand.<br/><br/>Camille extended it, allowing her mother to examine the ring.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s beautiful,&quot; her mother said softly. &quot;The phoenix, it suits you.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s what I thought,&quot; Alexander replied. &quot;A symbol of who she&#x27;s become.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And when is the wedding?&quot; someone asked.<br/><br/>Camille and Alexander exchanged glances. &quot;We haven&#x27;t set a date,&quot; she said. &quot;We wanted to get through the Grid launch first.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Well, now you can focus on something joyful,&quot; Hannah said, raising her glass. &quot;To Camille and Alexander!&quot;<br/><br/>Everyone drank to their health, offering congratulations, questions about their plans, teasing about keeping such a big secret.<br/><br/>Through it all, Camille noticed her father hanging back, watching her with an expression she couldn&#x27;t quite read. When there was a moment between well-wishes, she approached him.<br/><br/>&quot;You&#x27;re quiet,&quot; she said.<br/><br/>He nodded, looking down at his glass. &quot;I missed so much of your life. Your career success. Meeting Alexander. Now your engagement.&quot; Pain flashed across his face. &quot;I have only myself to blame.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille felt the old hurt rise within her, but also something else, a tiny wish to heal. &quot;You&#x27;re here now,&quot; she said. &quot;That&#x27;s a start.&quot;</div>
