        <h1>Chapter 97-2</h1>
        <div><br/>Her phone buzzed with a message from Alexander:<br/>*Camille found inconsistencies in the Grid blueprints. Minor but concerning. Someone may have tampered with them. Hannah investigating.*<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s breath caught. More evidence of a coordinated attack. She texted back:<br/>*Keep her close. Coming to you now.*<br/><br/>She grabbed her coat and moved toward the door, then paused, turning back to look once more at the frozen image on the screen, Rose and the shadow of a man whose face they couldn&#x27;t capture.<br/><br/>&quot;Who are you?&quot; she asked the figure. &quot;And what game are you playing?&quot;<br/><br/>The image, of course, gave no answer. But Victoria felt something she hadn&#x27;t experienced in years, a flutter of unease. Not fear, never fear. But a premonition that patterns were shifting, that variables she hadn&#x27;t accounted for were entering her carefully calculated equations.<br/><br/>For the first time since taking Camille under her wing, Victoria wondered if she might be outmaneuvered. The thought sent a chill through her that had nothing to do with the rain-cooled air.<br/><br/>** **<br/><br/>In her private elevator descending to the garage, Victoria pressed her palm against the hidden scanner, granting access to the secure communications system built into the wall.<br/><br/>&quot;Connect me to Alexander Pierce. Encrypted line.&quot;<br/><br/>A soft beep, then Alexander&#x27;s voice filled the small space. &quot;Victoria.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Can you speak freely?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes. Camille is with Hannah reviewing the altered sections of the blueprints. We&#x27;re alone.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria kept her voice low despite the elevator&#x27;s secure design. &quot;We have a situation. Rose has been meeting with someone, a man. We can&#x27;t identify him.&quot;<br/><br/>A pause. &quot;Someone helping her target the Grid?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It seems likely. The timing, the secrecy. My security team couldn&#x27;t track him, he knew they were following.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Professional.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; Victoria watched the floor numbers tick down. &quot;Alexander, I&#x27;ve never asked about the full extent of your resources. I know they&#x27;re substantial. More substantial, perhaps, than you&#x27;ve officially disclosed.&quot;<br/><br/>Another pause, longer this time. &quot;What exactly are you asking, Victoria?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Your surveillance capabilities. They exceed standard corporate security, don&#x27;t they?&quot;<br/><br/>The elevator reached the garage level but Victoria pressed the hold button, keeping the doors closed.<br/><br/>&quot;They do,&quot; Alexander admitted finally.<br/><br/>&quot;Then I need you to find this man. Identify him. My team can&#x27;t, and we&#x27;re running out of time.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You&#x27;re asking me to use methods that aren&#x27;t strictly legal.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria smiled thinly at his careful phrasing. &quot;I&#x27;m asking you to protect Camille. By any means necessary.&quot;<br/><br/>The silence stretched between them. When Alexander spoke again, his voice had hardened. &quot;I&#x27;ll find him. But Victoria, this is for Camille, not for you. I need you to understand the distinction.&quot;<br/><br/>The words stung more than Victoria would admit. &quot;Just do what needs to be done. And Alexander?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Don&#x27;t tell Camille about this yet. Not until we know what we&#x27;re facing. She needs to focus on the Grid.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;She won&#x27;t appreciate being kept in the dark.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;She&#x27;ll appreciate being blindsided by another attack even less.&quot; Victoria&#x27;s tone left no room for debate. &quot;Twenty-four hours. Give me that before you tell her.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Twenty-four hours,&quot; Alexander agreed reluctantly. &quot;But not a minute more. I won&#x27;t lie to her.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria ended the call and released the hold button. The elevator doors slid open to reveal her waiting car. As she stepped out, her phone buzzed again. A text from Martin:<br/>*Rose just entered Madison Park. Meeting someone. Team in position.*<br/><br/>Victoria slid into the back seat of her car. &quot;Change of plans, James. Madison Park. As quickly as possible.&quot;<br/><br/>The driver nodded, pulling smoothly out of the garage into the rain-slick streets. Victoria stared out at the passing city, her mind racing ahead, calculating risks and countermoves. Rose Lewis was a snake, dangerous but predictable in her hatred. But this new player, this shadow man with resources and training...he was the true threat.<br/><br/>Victoria had spent a lifetime anticipating her enemies&#x27; moves before they made them. It was how she had built her empire, how she had survived when others fell. But this felt different. The pieces on the board were moving in patterns she couldn&#x27;t quite grasp.<br/><br/>For Camille&#x27;s sake, she needed to see this enemy&#x27;s face. Understand his motives. Know his weaknesses.<br/><br/>The car sped through the rainy streets, carrying Victoria toward Madison Park and perhaps, toward answers. But as the familiar skyscrapers of midtown gave way to the lower buildings surrounding the park, the knot in her chest tightened.<br/><br/>She couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that for once in her long career of calculated risks and strategic victories, Victoria Kane might be too late.<br/></div>
