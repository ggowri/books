        <div><br/>&quot;Did you hear that?&quot; she whispered. &quot;She might not... she could have...&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander pulled her into a tight embrace. &quot;I heard. It&#x27;s good news, Camille. The best we could hope for.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille buried her face against his shoulder, letting the tears flow freely now, not tears of despair but of cautious hope. She had been preparing herself for imminent loss. To suddenly have the possibility of more time felt like a gift beyond measure.<br/><br/>A soft sound from the bed made them both turn. Victoria&#x27;s eyes were open, watching them with a clarity that had been absent for days.<br/><br/>&quot;Victoria?&quot; Camille moved quickly to her side. &quot;Can you hear me?&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria nodded slightly, her gaze steady despite the obvious effort it took to remain alert. &quot;I heard... the doctors,&quot; she whispered, her voice raspy from the breathing tube that had been removed just yesterday.<br/><br/>&quot;You&#x27;re going to get better treatment,&quot; Camille said, taking Victoria&#x27;s hand between both of hers. &quot;There&#x27;s a chance, a real chance...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I heard,&quot; Victoria interrupted gently. The ghost of a smile touched her lips. &quot;Years, not months.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes,&quot; Camille confirmed, a sob of relief escaping her. &quot;Years.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s fingers tightened around Camille&#x27;s, a weak grip, but stronger than yesterday. &quot;Good,&quot; she said simply. &quot;There&#x27;s still... work to do.&quot;<br/><br/>Typical Victoria, Camille thought. Already thinking about Kane Industries, about business, about the empire she had built.<br/><br/>But Victoria continued, her eyes holding Camille&#x27;s with surprising intensity. &quot;Work like... watching you rebuild. Seeing you... find happiness.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander stepped closer, placing a hand on Camille&#x27;s shoulder. &quot;She will,&quot; he promised Victoria. &quot;I&#x27;ll make sure of it.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria nodded slightly, acknowledging his vow. &quot;The bombing,&quot; she said, her voice growing clearer with each word. &quot;Rose?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;She hasn&#x27;t been caught yet,&quot; Alexander answered before Camille could. &quot;But the FBI are viewing the footage from the hotel and are looking for Rose, It&#x27;s just a matter of time.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s eyes returned to Camille. &quot;What will you do... when they find her?&quot;<br/><br/>Camille hadn&#x27;t allowed herself to think that far ahead. Her focus had been entirely on Victoria, on the moment-by-moment battle for recovery. But now, with the possibility of years rather than days stretched before them, the question of Rose loomed larger.<br/><br/>&quot;I don&#x27;t know,&quot; she admitted. &quot;Part of me wants justice. Part of me wants...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Revenge,&quot; Victoria finished for her. No judgment in the word, just understanding.<br/><br/>&quot;Yes,&quot; Camille acknowledged. &quot;But I also want to move forward. To rebuild what she destroyed. To show her that she failed to break me.&quot; She squeezed Victoria&#x27;s hand gently. &quot;Failed to take you from me.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s expression softened. &quot;Choose life,&quot; she said, the words carrying weight beyond their simplicity. &quot;Choose creation over destruction. Promise me.&quot;<br/><br/>The request echoed what Victoria had been teaching Camille since rescuing her from that parking garage, that true power comes not from tearing down but from building up. Not from revenge but from rising above it.<br/><br/>&quot;I promise,&quot; Camille whispered, meaning it more now than she could have before the doctors&#x27; news. With the gift of time came the possibility of healing. Of moving beyond the anger that had driven her for so long.<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s eyes closed briefly, fatigue evident in every line of her face. When she opened them again, there was a vulnerability there Camille had rarely seen.<br/><br/>&quot;Stay with me,&quot; Victoria murmured. &quot;Until I fall asleep.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m not going anywhere,&quot; Camille assured her, moving closer. &quot;I&#x27;ll be right here, Mommy.&quot;<br/><br/>The word slipped out naturally, unplanned yet perfectly right. Camille had called Victoria that once before, had barely acknowledged to herself the maternal role Victoria had taken in her life. But in this moment of shared vulnerability and hope, the truth of their relationship crystallized into that single word.<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s eyes widened slightly, a flash of emotion crossing her face before her usual composure returned. But her fingers tightened around Camille&#x27;s, and there was no mistaking the tears that gathered at the corners of her eyes.<br/><br/>&quot;My girl,&quot; she whispered, the words filled with a tenderness few people had ever heard from Victoria Kane. &quot;My beautiful, strong girl.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander moved quietly to the door, giving them privacy for this intimate moment. As he stepped into the hallway, he caught a glimpse of Camille leaning forward to press a gentle kiss to Victoria&#x27;s forehead, daughter to mother, a bond sealed in crisis and now given the precious gift of time to grow.<br/><br/>Outside the hospital window, the sun broke through clouds that had hung over the city since the bombing. A shaft of golden light fell across the bed, illuminating Victoria&#x27;s silver hair and Camille&#x27;s bent head, two women who had faced destruction and emerged with the possibility of years ahead rather than days.<br/><br/>It wasn&#x27;t a guarantee. The doctors had been clear about the challenges Victoria still faced. But it was hope, fragile but real. And in that moment, as Victoria drifted back to sleep with Camille still holding her hand, hope seemed enough to build a future on.<br/><br/>A future where creation trumped destruction. Where &quot;Mommy&quot; wasn&#x27;t a word said only in final goodbyes but in everyday moments for years to come. Where Rose&#x27;s bombs had failed to destroy what mattered most,the bond between two women who had chosen each other as family.<br/></div>
