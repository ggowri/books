        <h1>Chapter 178-2</h1>
        <div><br/>Murmurs rippled through the audience. Her lawyer closed his eyes briefly, as if pained. This was clearly not the statement he had advised.<br/><br/>&quot;My sister,&quot; Rose continued, her gaze never moving toward Camille, &quot;has always had advantages I was denied. Born to privilege while I was rescued from foster care. Treated as the golden child while I was the charity case.&quot;<br/><br/>Judge Hamilton leaned forward. &quot;Ms. Lewis, if this is an attempt to justify your actions...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It is an explanation, Your Honor, not a justification. I accept the jury&#x27;s verdict, but I reject the narrative that has been presented. I am not a monster. I am simply a woman who tried to claim what should have been hers.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille felt Alexander&#x27;s hand on her knee, steadying her. The audacity of Rose&#x27;s statement, the complete lack of remorse, should have angered her. Instead, she felt a wave of something like pity. Rose truly believed her own lies. All these years, all these crimes, and she still saw herself as the victim.<br/><br/>&quot;Are you finished, Ms. Lewis?&quot; the judge asked, her tone making it clear she was not impressed.<br/><br/>&quot;Just one more thing.&quot; For the first time, Rose turned to face Camille directly. &quot;I regret nothing.&quot;<br/><br/>The judge&#x27;s gavel struck sharply. &quot;Ms. Lewis, you have shown no remorse for actions that have cost multiple lives. Your statement only confirms what the evidence has shown, that you represent a continued danger to society and particularly to your sister.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose turned back to face the bench, her expression unchanged.<br/><br/>&quot;It is the sentence of this court that you be confined to the maximum security women&#x27;s facility at Bedford Hills for a term of not less than fifty years without the possibility of parole.&quot;<br/><br/>The gavel struck again. &quot;Court is adjourned.&quot;<br/><br/>As the bailiffs approached to lead Rose away, she turned once more toward Camille. The hatred in her eyes burned as bright as ever, undimmed by the verdict or the sentence. But something else lurked there too, a flicker of confusion, as if Rose couldn&#x27;t understand why Camille wasn&#x27;t gloating, wasn&#x27;t celebrating her downfall.<br/><br/>Then Rose was gone, led through the side door to begin her half-century of confinement. The spectators rose, the buzz of conversation filling the suddenly smaller-seeming room. Reporters rushed to file their updates.<br/><br/>&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Alexander asked softly.<br/><br/>Camille nodded, surprised to find it was true. &quot;I am.&quot;<br/><br/>Outside, they faced the inevitable press line. Questions flew at them from all directions.<br/><br/>&quot;Camille! How do you feel about the sentence?&quot;<br/>&quot;Ms. Kane! Will you be pursuing civil damages?&quot;<br/>&quot;Mr. Pierce! Any comment on Rose Lewis&#x27;s statement?&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander held up a hand, bringing a moment of quiet. &quot;Ms. Kane has a brief statement.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille stepped forward, feeling the weight of dozens of cameras on her. She had prepared remarks, carefully written and memorized, about justice and closure and moving forward.<br/><br/>Instead, she spoke from the emptiness she had felt yesterday, which today seemed less like emptiness and more like space, room for something new to grow.<br/><br/>&quot;Justice was served today,&quot; she said simply. &quot;Not revenge, but justice. That&#x27;s the difference that matters.&quot;<br/><br/>With that, she stepped back, allowing Alexander to guide her through the crowd to their waiting car.<br/><br/>&quot;That wasn&#x27;t what we practiced,&quot; he said once they were inside.<br/><br/>&quot;No,&quot; Camille agreed. &quot;It was better.&quot;<br/><br/>As the car pulled away from the courthouse, Camille looked back at the imposing building one last time. Inside those walls, her past had been laid bare, examined, judged. Rose would spend the rest of her life paying for what she had done.<br/><br/>But Camille wouldn&#x27;t spend the rest of her life defining herself by it.<br/><br/>&quot;You were right,&quot; she said to Alexander.<br/><br/>&quot;About what?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;About feeling nothing being progress.&quot; She turned from the window to face him. &quot;When Victoria first took me in, all I could feel was pain and rage. She taught me to channel that into revenge. But revenge would have kept me tied to Rose forever.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander nodded, waiting for her to continue.<br/><br/>&quot;Today, watching her, I realized something. Rose is still consumed by hatred. It&#x27;s all she has left. But I&#x27;m free of it.&quot; Camille looked down at her hands, surprised to find them steady. &quot;I don&#x27;t need to hate her anymore. I don&#x27;t need to fear her. I don&#x27;t need to think about her at all.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander reached across the seat, taking her hand in his. &quot;That&#x27;s not emptiness, Camille. That&#x27;s peace.&quot;<br/><br/>The word settled over her like a warm blanket. Peace. Not the fiery triumph Victoria had promised her revenge would bring. Not the bitter satisfaction of seeing her enemy fall. Something quieter, deeper, more lasting.<br/><br/>Camille leaned her head against Alexander&#x27;s shoulder as the car carried them away from the courthouse, away from Rose, away from the past.<br/><br/>Justice had been served. And it was enough.<br/></div>
