        <h1>Chapter 139-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 139<br/><br/>Special Agent Diana Chen ducked under the yellow tape surrounding what remained of Substation 12. The smell of burnt metal and melted plastic filled her nose. Five days after the explosion, the site still smoldered in places. FBI evidence techs in white suits moved through the wreckage, marking and collecting anything that might help identify who had done this.<br/><br/>&quot;What do we have so far?&quot; her partner, Agent Trent Morgan, asked as he joined her, notebook in hand.<br/><br/>Chen pointed to a corner where three techs huddled around something. &quot;They found pieces of the detonator. Military grade, just like at Substation 8.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;So we&#x27;re looking at the same person for both bombings,&quot; Morgan said, scribbling in his notebook.<br/><br/>&quot;It gets better.&quot; Chen led him toward a table where collected evidence sat in clear plastic bags. She picked up one containing a twisted piece of metal. &quot;Look at this.&quot;<br/><br/>Morgan squinted at the bag. &quot;Is that a business card?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What&#x27;s left of one.&quot; Chen nodded. &quot;Fire damaged it, but our lab confirmed part of a name. &#x27;TON.&#x27; And look at the corner,that&#x27;s a corporate logo.&quot;<br/><br/>Morgan took the bag, studying it closely. &quot;Preston Enterprises.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;As in Herod Preston,&quot; Chen said, her voice rising with excitement. &quot;The FBI database has his fingerprints from when he applied for an international business license. They found a match on pieces of wire from both explosion sites.&quot;<br/><br/>Morgan let out a low whistle. &quot;So we&#x27;ve got him at both scenes. We&#x27;ve got his business card. Motive?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s where it gets interesting.&quot; Chen pulled out her tablet, bringing up a file. &quot;Preston&#x27;s family had a shipping empire that collapsed about ten years ago after some kind of conflict with Victoria Kane. His father and brother both killed themselves afterward.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Revenge against Kane Industries,&quot; Morgan mused. &quot;But why now? Why wait ten years?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The Phoenix Grid is Victoria Kane&#x27;s biggest project in a decade,&quot; Chen said. &quot;Maximum damage to her legacy.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We need everything on this guy,&quot; Morgan said, his eyes hardening. &quot;Get a warrant for his apartment and office. I want to know what else he&#x27;s planning.&quot;<br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>Three hours later, the FBI tactical team broke down the door of Herod Preston&#x27;s penthouse apartment. Morgan and Chen followed them in, weapons drawn.<br/><br/>&quot;Clear!&quot; called the team leader after checking each room. &quot;No one&#x27;s home.&quot;<br/><br/>Morgan holstered his weapon, looking around the luxurious space. Floor-to-ceiling windows offered a panoramic view of the city. Expensive furniture, original artwork on the walls, a bar stocked with top-shelf liquor.<br/><br/>&quot;He lives well,&quot; Chen remarked, pulling on latex gloves.<br/><br/>&quot;Lived well,&quot; Morgan corrected. &quot;After this, his life is over.&quot;<br/><br/>The evidence response team moved through the apartment, dusting for fingerprints, photographing everything, searching for evidence.<br/><br/>&quot;Agent Morgan!&quot; called one of the techs from the bedroom. &quot;You need to see this.&quot;<br/><br/>Morgan and Chen hurried into the master bedroom. On the bed lay architectural blueprints of the Phoenix Grid substations. Red marks highlighted vulnerable points, the exact locations where the bombs had been placed. Next to the blueprints sat a notebook filled with calculations: blast radii, structural damage estimates, power outage projections.<br/><br/>&quot;Holy mother of....&quot; Chen whispered. &quot;It&#x27;s like he wasn&#x27;t even trying to hide it.&quot;<br/><br/>Morgan flipped through the notebook. Page after page of detailed plans, all in the same handwriting. &quot;Check these for prints,&quot; he ordered a nearby tech.<br/><br/>Near the blueprints lay a map of the entire Grid system, with one location circled multiple times in red: the main control center.<br/><br/>&quot;He&#x27;s planning another attack,&quot; Morgan said, his voice tight. &quot;Get me everything on the security measures at the main control center. Now.&quot;<br/><br/>Another agent approached holding a tablet. &quot;Sir, we found this in the safe.&quot; <br/><br/>On the screen were pages of text, emails between Preston and someone identified only as &quot;H.P.&quot; discussing the bombings. Messages sent from Preston to himself, documenting his plans, his hatred for Victoria Kane, his determination to destroy everything she had built.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s a journal,&quot; Chen said, scrolling through the entries. &quot;He documented everything.&quot;<br/><br/>Morgan shook his head, amazed at the man&#x27;s arrogance. &quot;He thought he was untouchable.&quot;<br/><br/>As the team continued searching, more evidence mounted. Financial records showing Preston had withdrawn large sums of cash in the weeks before each bombing. Receipts for components that matched those used in the explosive devices. Photos of the substations taken days before the attacks, with Preston&#x27;s fingerprints on them.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s overwhelming,&quot; Chen said as they stood in the living room, surveying the collected evidence. &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen a case this clear-cut.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;He&#x27;s not just a bomber,&quot; Morgan said grimly. &quot;He&#x27;s a would-be mass murderer.&quot; He pointed to a page of the notebook a tech had just bagged. &quot;Look at his calculations for casualties if he hits the main control center during working hours.&quot;<br/><br/>Chen looked sick as she read the numbers. &quot;He&#x27;s estimating at least fifty dead.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Issue an APB immediately,&quot; Morgan ordered. &quot;All airports, train stations, bus terminals. I want Preston&#x27;s face everywhere. Consider him armed and extremely dangerous.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What about his associates?&quot; Chen asked. &quot;Anyone who might be helping him?&quot;<br/><br/>Morgan considered this. &quot;Check his phone records, emails, social media. But from what we&#x27;re seeing, this looks like a one-man vendetta. A rich guy with resources, technical knowledge, and a decade-old grudge.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The worst kind of enemy,&quot; Chen murmured.<br/><br/>As the team packed up the evidence, Morgan stood at the window, looking out at the city, at the millions of people who would be affected if the main control center was destroyed. Somewhere out there, Herod Preston was hiding, planning his next move.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;re not just trying to solve two bombings anymore,&quot; Morgan said quietly. &quot;We&#x27;re trying to prevent a massacre.&quot;<br/><br/>* * *</div>
