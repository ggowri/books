        <h1>Chapter 67-1</h1>
        <div> Chapter 67<br/><br/>Stefan Rodriguez stared into his whiskey glass, watching the amber liquid catch the dim bar light. This was his fourth drink of the night, or maybe his fifth. He&#x27;d lost count somewhere between the endless news alerts about Rose&#x27;s scandal and the memories that wouldn&#x27;t stop haunting him.<br/><br/>The bar was nearly empty on this rainy Tuesday night. Just him, the tired-looking bartender who had stopped trying to make conversation hours ago, and a couple in the far corner who seemed too wrapped up in each other to notice anything else. Perfect. The last thing Stefan wanted right now was recognition, questions, or worse, pity.<br/><br/>He took another long swallow, letting the burn travel down his throat. The television above the bar played footage of Rose leaving her apartment building, surrounded by reporters shouting questions about her affairs, her stolen designs, her connections to questionable money. The sound was muted, but Stefan could almost hear her practiced denials, her careful performance of wronged innocence.<br/><br/>&quot;Turn that off,&quot; he muttered to the bartender, who glanced up at the screen and reached for the remote without comment.<br/><br/>The sudden silence felt heavier somehow. Without the distraction of Rose&#x27;s public disgrace, Stefan was left alone with thoughts that had been circling his mind for days. How had he been so blind? So easily manipulated? So completely fooled by a woman whose entire existence, it seemed, was built on calculation and lies?<br/><br/>The bartender set another whiskey in front of him without being asked. &quot;On the house,&quot; he said, his eyes reflecting something that might have been understanding. &quot;You look like you need it.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan nodded his thanks, too exhausted for words. The past week had hollowed him out. First the collapse of his family&#x27;s shipping empire, then the discovery of Rose&#x27;s deception, and now this public spectacle of her unraveling life. He should feel vindicated seeing her carefully constructed image crumble. Instead, he felt only a bone-deep weariness that no amount of alcohol seemed to touch.<br/><br/>His phone buzzed on the bar top. His father, again. The third call tonight. Stefan silenced it without answering. What could he possibly say to the man whose legacy he had failed to protect? Whose family name now stood tarnished by association with Rose Lewis?<br/><br/>The small Rodriguez Shipping operation in Seattle was still functioning, but barely. The employees who had remained loyal deserved better than a broken man drowning his failures in whiskey. They deserved a leader with focus, with drive, with some plan for rebuilding from the ashes.<br/><br/>Stefan ran a hand through his disheveled hair, remembering when he had been that man. When he had believed himself worthy of the Rodriguez name. When he had thought himself in love with a woman who turned out to be a stranger.<br/><br/>No, not a stranger. A predator.<br/><br/>The emails the investigator had uncovered had revealed the truth with brutal clarity. Rose wasn&#x27;t a kind and good woman. She had been plotting, manipulating, calculating for years. The calls from London. The &quot;chance&quot; encounters when she returned to New York. The perfectly timed comfort offered when his marriage to Camille had struggled.<br/><br/>All deliberate. All strategic. All focused on achieving what she wanted, regardless of who suffered in the process.<br/><br/>Including Camille.<br/><br/>Stefan closed his eyes as memories of his wife flooded back. Camille, with her gentle smile and quiet determination. Camille, who had loved him despite his flaws, despite his family&#x27;s cold welcome, despite the distance he had placed between them as Rose&#x27;s influence grew.<br/><br/>Camille, whose car had gone off that bridge two nights after he had asked for a divorce. The night after he had chosen Rose.<br/><br/>The guilt was a physical pain in his chest, sharper than any business failure, any public humiliation. The knowledge that he had thrown away something genuine for a carefully crafted illusion felt like swallowing broken glass.<br/><br/>&quot;You okay, buddy?&quot; the bartender asked, pausing in his task of wiping down glasses.<br/><br/>Stefan opened his eyes, surprised to find his vision blurred. &quot;Fine,&quot; he managed. &quot;Just... thinking.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Dangerous activity after midnight,&quot; the bartender said, not unkindly. &quot;Especially with that much whiskey involved.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan attempted a smile that felt more like a grimace. &quot;Some thoughts follow you no matter how much you drink.&quot;<br/><br/>The bartender nodded knowingly. &quot;Those are the ones worth listening to, usually.&quot;<br/><br/>The simple wisdom hit harder than it should have. Stefan had spent nearly two years not listening to his thoughts, not about his failing marriage, not about Rose&#x27;s convenient timing, not about the business decisions that had left Rodriguez Shipping vulnerable to hostile takeover. He had silenced every warning, ignored every red flag, dismissed every instinct that might have saved him from where he sat now.<br/><br/>His phone buzzed again, not a call this time, but a news alert. Stefan knew he should ignore it, spare himself whatever fresh humiliation the media had uncovered about Rose or their relationship. But some masochistic impulse made him pick up the device and check the notification.</div>
