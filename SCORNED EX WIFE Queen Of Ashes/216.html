        <h1>Chapter 141-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 141<br/><br/>Victoria Kane stared at the medical report on her desk, the words blurring as her eyes filled with unwanted tears. The cancer had spread faster than expected. Six months, maybe less, was all the time she had left. She pushed the papers away and stood to look out her office window.<br/><br/>Her own reflection stared back at her, thinner now, her face pale and drawn from the treatments that weren&#x27;t working. The doctor had suggested stopping them, focusing instead on comfort measures. &quot;Quality of life over quantity,&quot; he&#x27;d said gently.<br/><br/>Victoria had walked out without answering. Quality wasn&#x27;t enough. She needed time. Time to secure Camille&#x27;s future. Time to make sure her daughter by choice would be protected when Victoria was gone.<br/><br/>Her assistant&#x27;s voice came through the intercom. &quot;Mrs. Lewis has arrived.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria straightened her jacket, checked her reflection once more, and squared her shoulders. No one, not even Margaret Lewis, would see her weakness today.<br/><br/>&quot;Send her in.&quot;<br/><br/>Margaret Lewis stepped into the office, hesitating just inside the doorway. The mother of the daughter Victoria had claimed as her own. Once, Victoria had hated this woman for her blindness, for choosing Rose over Camille time and again. Now, facing her own mortality, hate felt like a luxury she could no longer afford.<br/><br/>&quot;Thank you for coming,&quot; Victoria said, gesturing to the chair across from her desk.<br/><br/>Margaret sat, her hands fidgeting with her purse. &quot;Your message said it was about Camille.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; Victoria lowered herself into her chair, fighting not to show how much the simple movement pained her. &quot;I need to speak with you about Camille&#x27;s future.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Her future?&quot; Margaret&#x27;s eyebrows rose. &quot;I thought that was firmly in your hands.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;For now.&quot; Victoria pushed a small button on her desk, and the office windows darkened, giving them complete privacy. &quot;But my time is limited.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria rarely showed her cards to anyone, but death had a way of changing the rules. &quot;I&#x27;m dying, Mrs. Lewis. Cancer. It&#x27;s spread to my liver and bones.&quot;<br/><br/>Margaret&#x27;s shock showed plainly on her face. &quot;Does Camille know?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No.&quot; Victoria shook her head. &quot;She thinks the surgery was successful. That I&#x27;m recovering.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Why lie to her?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;To protect her. She has enough to deal with right now. Rose is still out there, still dangerous.&quot; Victoria leaned forward. &quot;And Camille would put everything aside to care for me if she knew the truth. Her work. Her relationship with Pierce. Her own healing. I can&#x27;t allow that.&quot;<br/><br/>Margaret studied Victoria&#x27;s face. &quot;So why tell me? We&#x27;ve hardly been allies.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Because I&#x27;m running out of time to secure what matters.&quot; Victoria&#x27;s voice hardened. &quot;And despite everything, you&#x27;re still Camille&#x27;s mother. She may need you when I&#x27;m gone.&quot;<br/><br/>The words seemed to hit Margaret like a physical blow. &quot;You&#x27;ve been more of a mother to her this past year than I was for decades.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s not entirely true.&quot; Victoria&#x27;s voice softened. &quot;You raised her to be kind. To be strong in ways I never understood until I met her. You gave her eighteen good years before Rose entered your lives.&quot;<br/><br/>Tears filled Margaret&#x27;s eyes. &quot;And then I failed her. Completely.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria nodded, not offering false comfort. &quot;Yes. You chose wrong. Repeatedly. But now you have a chance to choose differently.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Is that why I&#x27;m here? For absolution?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No.&quot; Victoria shook her head. &quot;I&#x27;m not in the business of forgiveness. I&#x27;m here to make sure Camille is protected when I&#x27;m gone.&quot;<br/><br/>Margaret straightened in her chair. &quot;Protected from Rose, you mean.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;From Rose. From opportunists who will see her as Victoria Kane&#x27;s inexperienced heir. From her own tendency to see the best in people who don&#x27;t deserve it.&quot; Victoria coughed, a harsh sound that left her breathless for a moment. When she continued, her voice was rougher. &quot;I need to know if you&#x27;ll stand with her. Truly stand with her, no matter what.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Of course I will.&quot; Margaret sounded offended by the question. &quot;She&#x27;s my daughter.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;She was your daughter when Rose manipulated her. When Stefan betrayed her. When she tried to tell you the truth and you chose not to believe her.&quot; Victoria&#x27;s eyes were cold. &quot;Being your daughter wasn&#x27;t enough to protect her then.&quot;<br/><br/>Margaret flinched but didn&#x27;t look away. &quot;I&#x27;ve learned from my mistakes.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Have you?&quot; Victoria pressed. &quot;If Rose appeared tomorrow with tears and a convincing story, would you welcome her back? Would you urge Camille to forgive her again?&quot;</div>
