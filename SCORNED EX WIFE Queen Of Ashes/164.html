        <h1>Chapter 110-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 110<br/><br/>The clock on the wall of the control room read 3:17 AM as Camille stood by Hannah Zhao&#x27;s workstation, watching streams of code flicker across multiple screens. A faint blue glow bathed the room in ethereal light, casting long shadows across the faces of the twelve engineers who had been working without pause for nearly thirty-six hours.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s time,&quot; Hannah said, looking up at Camille with red-rimmed eyes that nonetheless sparkled with determination. &quot;The first section of the Grid is ready for activation.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded, her heart pounding against her ribs. &quot;Everyone in position?&quot;<br/><br/>Through her earpiece, Alexander&#x27;s steady voice confirmed, &quot;Security teams are in place. The suspected saboteur is working on the east junction, thinking he&#x27;s alone while preparing the final circuits.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And whoever it is has no idea we&#x27;ve replaced everything?&quot; Camille asked Hannah.<br/><br/>Hannah&#x27;s lips curved into a smile that held no humor. &quot;Not unless they actually test the components, which doesn&#x27;t appear to be part of their instructions. Whoever it is, they&#x27;re following the sabotaged plans to the letter, installing modified circuits that would trigger a cascade failure seventy-two hours after full activation.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille took a deep breath, steadying herself against the edge of the desk. This wasn&#x27;t just a business venture or even a simple triumph over Rose and Herod. The Phoenix Grid represented something more profound—her rebirth from the ashes of Camille Lewis into someone new, someone who created rather than destroyed.<br/><br/>&quot;Let&#x27;s bring it online,&quot; she said quietly.<br/><br/>Hannah&#x27;s fingers flew across the keyboard. &quot;Initiating power sequence to Section A. Substation One coming online in five, four, three, two...&quot;<br/><br/>The room fell silent as the main display showed a schematic of the Grid&#x27;s first section, a network of intersecting lines spanning six city blocks. For a heart-stopping moment, nothing happened. Then, one by one, the connection points illuminated, bright blue dots spreading through the network like stars appearing in the evening sky.<br/><br/>&quot;Power flow stable,&quot; called out Rishabh from his monitoring station. &quot;All junction points green. Transformer loads at expected levels.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Voltage regulation is holding,&quot; added Elena, her voice tight with concentration. &quot;No fluctuations detected.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Security protocols active,&quot; said Marcus, his fingers moving rapidly across his keyboard. &quot;No unauthorized access attempts.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille found herself holding her breath as the indicators continued to light up across the display. This was it, the moment they would discover if their countermeasures had worked, if they had truly managed to outmaneuver Rose and Herod&#x27;s sabotage.<br/><br/>&quot;Section A fully operational,&quot; Hannah announced finally, swiveling in her chair to face the room. &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, we have successfully brought the first section of the Phoenix Grid online.&quot;<br/><br/>A cheer erupted from the exhausted team, the sound of it washing over Camille like a wave. She closed her eyes briefly, allowing herself to feel the victory.<br/><br/>&quot;Remarkable work,&quot; came Victoria&#x27;s voice from the doorway. Camille hadn&#x27;t heard her enter. &quot;But I presume we&#x27;re maintaining appearances?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes,&quot; Hannah confirmed, suddenly serious again. &quot;From the outside, it appears we&#x27;re following the sabotaged blueprints exactly. Our corrections are invisible unless someone physically inspects the components we&#x27;ve replaced.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria nodded, her silver hair catching the blue light from the screens. &quot;And what about our mysterious installer?&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s voice came through the speakers. &quot;Currently packing up his tools, looking rather pleased with himself. He just made a call, encrypted, but our team picked up the word &#x27;complete.&#x27; He thinks his part is done.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Let him think that,&quot; Camille said, moving to stand beside Victoria. &quot;The more confident Rose and Herod feel, the more likely they are to be at the launch ceremony.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria studied the displays, her expression unreadable. &quot;I&#x27;ve known many enemies in my time, but few as persistent as the Prestons. Herod&#x27;s father would be proud of his son&#x27;s dedication.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We have something they don&#x27;t,&quot; Alexander replied through the comm system. &quot;We know they&#x27;re coming.&quot;<br/><br/>Hannah gestured toward another screen showing complex data flows. &quot;I&#x27;ve implemented what I call &#x27;honeypot errors&#x27; deliberate minor issues in the system that appear to be part of the normal startup process. If anyone&#x27;s monitoring our systems remotely, they&#x27;ll see exactly what they expect to see: a grid with hidden flaws preparing to fail catastrophically.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And the backup power systems?&quot; Victoria asked.<br/><br/>&quot;Triple redundancy, just as you requested,&quot; Hannah confirmed. &quot;If anything goes wrong, we can shift to alternate circuits in milliseconds. No interruption, no explosions, no chaos.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille felt a strange mixture of emotions as she watched the blue lights of her creation pulse with life. Pride in what they had built. Anger at those who sought to destroy it. And something else, a quiet satisfaction that went beyond revenge.<br/><br/>&quot;I need a moment,&quot; she murmured, stepping away from the group and walking to the large windows overlooking the city.<br/><br/>Dawn was still hours away, but New York never truly slept. Lights twinkled in office buildings and apartments, people going about their lives unaware of the battle being waged in the shadows. Somewhere out there, Rose and Herod were waiting, watching, planning.<br/><br/>Camille&#x27;s reflection stared back at her from the glass—a woman transformed by pain and purpose, harder than she once was but perhaps stronger for it. She barely resembled Camille Lewis anymore, that trusting woman who had signed divorce papers with quiet dignity before walking into a trap.<br/><br/>&quot;Penny for your thoughts?&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s voice startled her. He had arrived in person, his reflection appearing beside hers in the window.<br/><br/>&quot;I was just thinking about who I&#x27;ve become,&quot; she admitted. &quot;When Victoria found me, all I wanted was to make them pay. Now...&quot;</div>
