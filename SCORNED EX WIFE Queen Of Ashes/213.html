        <h1>Chapter 139-2</h1>
        <div><br/>Back at FBI headquarters, Morgan stood before a wall covered in photos, documents, and timelines. At the center was a picture of Herod Preston, tall, handsome, with cold eyes that seemed to challenge anyone looking at him.<br/><br/>&quot;Financial analysis came in,&quot; Chen said, entering with a stack of reports. &quot;Preston was on the verge of bankruptcy three months ago. His company was failing, his investments tanking. Then suddenly, he pays off all his debts, starts spending like crazy.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Source of the money?&quot; Morgan asked, not looking away from Preston&#x27;s photo.<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s the thing,&quot; Chen said. &quot;We can&#x27;t find it. He emptied several offshore accounts, but we don&#x27;t know where those funds came from originally.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;So he was preparing,&quot; Morgan mused. &quot;Getting his finances in order before launching his attacks.&quot;<br/><br/>A junior agent entered, holding a report. &quot;Sir, ballistics confirmed the explosives used in both substations were military grade, available only through black market channels.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Preston has shipping connections all over the world,&quot; Chen noted. &quot;He could have brought them in through any number of ports.&quot;<br/><br/>Morgan nodded, pieces falling into place. &quot;What about his personal life? Any relationships we should know about?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;He&#x27;s been seen at several events with Rose Lewis, 28, the adopted sister of Camille Kane,&quot; Chen said, checking her notes. &quot;But there&#x27;s nothing to suggest she knows anything about the bombings. She was at The Plaza Hotel during both attacks, confirmed by multiple witnesses and security footage.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Just a coincidence, then,&quot; Morgan said, dismissing it. &quot;Focus on Preston. I want to know where he is, who he&#x27;s contacted, what he&#x27;s planning next.&quot;<br/><br/>His phone rang, the lab with preliminary results on the notebook found in Preston&#x27;s apartment.<br/><br/>&quot;Morgan,&quot; he answered, putting the call on speaker.<br/><br/>&quot;Sir, we&#x27;ve confirmed all the handwriting in the notebook belongs to Preston,&quot; came the voice on the other end. &quot;Fingerprints match too. And we found traces of the same explosive compounds used in the bombings on several pages.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Anything else?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes, sir. We analyzed the map with the control center circled. Based on the pen impressions, we believe he was planning to attack tomorrow night, around 9 PM.&quot;<br/><br/>Morgan and Chen exchanged alarmed looks.<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s when the Grid is scheduled to reach full operational capacity,&quot; Chen said, checking her tablet. &quot;Maximum impact.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Get me Kane Industries security on the phone,&quot; Morgan ordered. &quot;And I want a tactical team ready to move to the control center immediately.&quot;<br/><br/>As agents rushed to carry out his orders, Morgan stared at Preston&#x27;s photo on the evidence wall.<br/><br/>&quot;What drives a man to this?&quot; he wondered aloud. &quot;The bombings weren&#x27;t just about damage, they were about sending a message. Making Kane suffer.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Revenge is powerful,&quot; Chen said quietly. &quot;Especially when it&#x27;s been brewing for a decade.&quot;<br/><br/>Morgan nodded slowly. &quot;But revenge this calculated, this patient... it&#x27;s almost admirable in a twisted way. He waited for the perfect moment, the perfect target.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And now he&#x27;s disappeared,&quot; Chen added. &quot;With enough explosives to take down the main control center.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;He won&#x27;t succeed,&quot; Morgan said firmly. &quot;We know his target. We know his timeline. For the first time, we&#x27;re ahead of him.&quot;<br/><br/>A junior agent approached with a tablet. &quot;Sir, we found something else in Preston&#x27;s files. Plans for after the attack. A private plane waiting at a small airfield in New Jersey, scheduled for tomorrow night. Destination: Venezuela.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No extradition,&quot; Chen noted.<br/><br/>&quot;He wasn&#x27;t planning to die in the attack,&quot; Morgan said. &quot;He wanted to watch the fallout from afar. To see Kane suffer.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Classic narcissist,&quot; Chen agreed. &quot;He doesn&#x27;t just want revenge, he wants to enjoy it.&quot;<br/><br/>Morgan turned to the assembled team, his voice commanding attention. &quot;We have less than 36 hours to find Herod Preston before he attacks the control center. Every resource, every agent, every contact, I want everything focused on finding this man.&quot;<br/><br/>As the team dispersed to carry out his orders, Morgan turned back to the evidence wall. Something about the case bothered him, a feeling he couldn&#x27;t quite define. It was all too perfect, too neat. Preston had left them a clear trail, as if he wanted to be identified.<br/><br/>But why? Why leave so much evidence?<br/><br/>&quot;Maybe he wants the recognition,&quot; Chen suggested when Morgan voiced his concern. &quot;Some bombers do it for the fame, the notoriety.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Maybe,&quot; Morgan conceded, though he wasn&#x27;t convinced.<br/><br/>Whatever Preston&#x27;s reasons, one thing was clear: he needed to be stopped. Before more lives were lost. Before Victoria Kane&#x27;s legacy was destroyed.<br/><br/>Before Herod Preston completed his decade-long quest for revenge.<br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>As night fell over the city, Morgan stood on the roof of the FBI building, watching lights flicker on across the skyline. Many of those lights now powered by the Phoenix Grid,the same grid Herod Preston was determined to destroy.<br/><br/>His phone buzzed with a text from the surveillance team: &quot;No sign of Preston at any known locations. Still searching.&quot;<br/><br/>Morgan put the phone away, frustration gnawing at him. How did a man like Preston, wealthy, visible, well-known, simply disappear?<br/><br/>The answer was as troubling as it was obvious: he&#x27;d planned this. All of it. The bombs, the evidence, the escape. Every detail meticulously arranged over months, perhaps years.<br/><br/>This wasn&#x27;t a crime of passion. This was calculated hatred, refined like high-grade uranium, deadly and precise.<br/><br/>Tomorrow night, Preston would try to destroy the control center. To kill dozens of innocent people. To cripple the city&#x27;s power grid and bring Victoria Kane&#x27;s empire crashing down.<br/><br/>Unless Morgan found him first.<br/><br/>The city lights blurred as exhaustion crept in. Morgan rubbed his eyes, knowing he should sleep but too wired to even consider it.<br/>.<br/></div>
