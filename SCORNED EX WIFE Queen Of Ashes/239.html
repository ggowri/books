        <h1>Chapter 154-2</h1>
        <div><br/>She paused at the building&#x27;s exit, watching through glass doors as people ran past. Some were covered in soot, their fancy clothes torn and dirtied. Survivors of her masterpiece. Rose studied their faces, searching for signs of Camille or Victoria among them.<br/><br/>Nothing.<br/><br/>Rose pushed open the door and stepped outside, immediately engulfed by chaos. The street was jammed with emergency vehicles, their lights painting everything in pulses of red and blue. Police shouted orders. Paramedics rushed past with stretchers. Smoke hung in the air like fog, burning her eyes and throat.<br/><br/>She moved through the crowd, invisible in the confusion. No one noticed another shocked face, another person staring at the burning building. Rose pulled the wig from her bag and slipped it on, then added the glasses. The transformation was simple but effective, no one looking for Rose Lewis would see her here.<br/><br/>As she pushed closer to the police barriers, Rose caught snatches of conversation around her:<br/><br/>&quot;.... they&#x27;re saying at least three bombs....&quot;<br/>&quot;... someone targeted the Phoenix Foundation...&quot;<br/>&quot;....dozens injured, maybe worse....&quot;<br/>&quot;.... they got Victoria Kane out but....&quot;<br/><br/>Rose froze, focusing on a man speaking to a police officer.<br/><br/>&quot;I saw them take her out on a stretcher,&quot; the man was saying. &quot;Victoria Kane. She collapsed right after they rescued her adopted daughter from inside.&quot;<br/><br/>Rescued. The word hit Rose like a physical blow. Camille had been rescued. She wasn&#x27;t dead.<br/><br/>A scream built in Rose&#x27;s throat, threatening to escape. She swallowed it back, hands clenched so tightly her nails cut into her palms. The pain helped focus her thoughts.<br/><br/>If Camille was alive, then Rose hadn&#x27;t won yet. The destruction around her, the burning building, the injured guests, the ruined gala, none of it mattered if Camille still breathed.<br/><br/>Rose pushed through the crowd until she reached the line of ambulances. Medical personnel rushed between them, carrying the injured, calling orders. She scanned each face, each stretcher, looking for any sign of her sister.<br/><br/>There, a flash of blue fabric. The color of Camille&#x27;s gown. Rose moved closer, peering through the open doors of an ambulance.<br/><br/>A woman lay inside, oxygen mask covering her face, paramedics working around her. But it wasn&#x27;t Camille. Just another guest in a blue dress, another victim of Rose&#x27;s plan.<br/><br/>Frustration boiled inside her. Rose turned in a circle, trying to see everything at once. Where was Camille? Where was Victoria? Had they already been taken to a hospital?<br/><br/>A police officer approached, eyeing her suspiciously. &quot;Ma&#x27;am, you need to step back behind the barricade.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose nodded, forcing her face into an expression of shock and concern. &quot;I&#x27;m sorry. I was looking for my friend. She was at the gala.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;All victims are being transported to Memorial Hospital or City General,&quot; the officer said, more gently now. &quot;You should check there.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Thank you,&quot; Rose whispered, already backing away.<br/><br/>Memorial Hospital. City General. New destinations. New opportunities to finish what she&#x27;d started.<br/><br/>As Rose moved away from the police barricade, her gaze returned to the burning hotel. The flames had grown higher, consuming what remained of the ballroom where her sister had stood so proudly. Where Victoria Kane had watched her adopted daughter shine. Where the Phoenix Foundation had been celebrated.<br/><br/>All of it now ash and rubble.<br/><br/>Rose began to laugh again, softly at first, then louder. A few people nearby glanced at her strangely, but in the chaos of the night, a woman laughing seemed no stranger than people crying or shouting or staring in shocked silence.<br/><br/>Her laughter was wild, unrestrained. The sound of something breaking free after being caged too long. The sound of madness, perhaps, but also of purest joy. Because even if Camille had survived, Rose had still hurt her. Had still destroyed the foundation she&#x27;d built. Had still proved that nowhere was safe, no triumph secure.<br/><br/>And she wasn&#x27;t finished yet.<br/><br/>Rose turned away from the burning building, her mind already racing toward new plans, new attacks. The hospitals would be chaotic tonight. Security would be focused on caring for victims, not watching for threats. If Camille was there, she would be vulnerable. If Victoria was there...<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s laughter cut off abruptly, replaced by a cold smile. Perhaps the night&#x27;s work wasn&#x27;t complete after all.<br/><br/>She disappeared into the crowd, just another face in the sea of onlookers. Just another shadow moving through the smoke-filled night. But unlike the shocked bystanders around her, Rose moved with purpose. With certainty.<br/><br/>The destruction behind her was just the beginning. The ruins of the Grand Plaza Hotel were merely the first act in her revenge.<br/><br/>And as sirens wailed and people cried and the building continued to burn, Rose Lewis laughed once more, the sound lost in the chaos she had created, but the feeling of it vibrating through her entire body, a savage pleasure that nothing and no one could take away.<br/><br/>Not even Camille.<br/></div>
