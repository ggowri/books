        <h1>Chapter 88-2</h1>
        <div><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s not a suggestion,&quot; Eleanor said coldly. &quot;It&#x27;s a decision. The vote was seven to three.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria stood slowly. &quot;You held a vote without the CEO?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Emergency provision, section 7B of the corporate charter,&quot; Thomas Gordon stated. &quot;When leadership decisions may impact company valuation by more than fifteen percent, the board may convene without full executive presence.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;May I remind this board that I hold controlling interest in Kane Industries?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You hold sixty percent,&quot; Gordon corrected. &quot;Significant, but not controlling.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ve led this company through three recessions, two hostile takeover attempts, and countless market fluctuations,&quot; Victoria said, each word precise. &quot;I&#x27;ve increased shareholder value by over six hundred percent during my tenure. And you presume to make decisions about my chosen successor without me?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This isn&#x27;t personal, Victoria,&quot; Whitley attempted. &quot;It&#x27;s business. The market has spoken.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It is entirely personal,&quot; Victoria interrupted. &quot;This entire situation stems from a personal vendetta against Camille, and by extension, against me.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Regardless of origin,&quot; Eleanor said, &quot;the damage is real. We must contain it.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille felt the weight of their judgment. She had prepared to fight external enemies—Rose, the media, public opinion. She hadn&#x27;t expected exile from within.<br/><br/>&quot;I understand the board&#x27;s concern,&quot; she said, surprising herself with her steady voice. &quot;Kane Industries&#x27; success matters more than any individual. Even me.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s head snapped toward her, a flash of something crossing her face.<br/><br/>&quot;If stepping back temporarily helps stabilize market confidence,&quot; Camille continued, &quot;I&#x27;m willing to do so. On one condition.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You&#x27;re not in a position to make conditions,&quot; Gordon said dismissively.<br/><br/>Camille fixed him with a stare that made him flinch. &quot;My condition is that I remain fully involved with Phoenix Grid development, even if not publicly. The project needs my oversight to succeed.&quot;<br/><br/>Whitley nodded slowly. &quot;That seems reasonable.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;James,&quot; Victoria began, a warning in her voice.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s a sensible compromise, Victoria,&quot; he said quietly.<br/><br/>Camille turned to Victoria, silently pleading with her to understand. This wasn&#x27;t surrender. It was tactical retreat.<br/><br/>Finally, Victoria faced the board again. &quot;Very well. Camille will step back from public duties temporarily. All Phoenix Grid operational decisions still run through her. And the company releases a statement today expressing full confidence in her leadership and denouncing these false allegations.&quot;<br/><br/>Eleanor frowned. &quot;The statement should focus on Kane Industries&#x27; stability, not personal—&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Those are my terms,&quot; Victoria cut her off. &quot;Take them or I call for a confidence vote on every person at this table.&quot;<br/><br/>The threat hung in the air.<br/><br/>&quot;Fine,&quot; Whitley conceded after a tense silence. &quot;PR will draft something for your approval.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria stood. &quot;This meeting is adjourned. Camille and I have a company to run. Despite your best efforts to hamstring us.&quot;<br/><br/>As the board members filed out, only James Whitley paused at the door. &quot;Victoria, this isn&#x27;t personal. We&#x27;re trying to protect what you&#x27;ve built.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Get out,&quot; Victoria replied, her voice like ice.<br/><br/>When the door closed, Victoria sank back into her chair, suddenly looking older than Camille had ever seen her.<br/><br/>&quot;I should have prepared you better,&quot; Victoria said. &quot;For what it feels like when the knives come from inside the house.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You couldn&#x27;t have,&quot; Camille replied. &quot;Some lessons you can only learn by bleeding.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s eyes softened. &quot;You handled that well. Better than I did.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I gave in. You didn&#x27;t.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No,&quot; Victoria shook her head. &quot;You adapted. There&#x27;s a difference.&quot; She stared out at the New York skyline. &quot;I&#x27;ve watched directors come and go for thirty years. Weathered their challenges, their doubts. But this... This feels different.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Because it is different. This isn&#x27;t just business maneuvering. This is Rose. And whoever&#x27;s helping her.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Herod Preston,&quot; Victoria practically spat the name. &quot;Using Rose to strike at us both.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Then we strike back,&quot; Camille said, resolve strengthening.<br/><br/>Victoria studied her face. &quot;They&#x27;ll be watching for exactly that. Any sign of &#x27;erratic behavior&#x27; will only reinforce their narrative.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Then we do what Kane women do best,&quot; Camille said. &quot;We fight smarter, not harder.&quot;<br/><br/>The hint of a smile touched Victoria&#x27;s lips. &quot;You are truly my daughter now.&quot;<br/><br/>A knock at the door interrupted them. Victoria&#x27;s assistant entered.<br/><br/>&quot;Ms. Kane, the PR team is waiting. And... Mr. Pierce called again. He says it&#x27;s urgent.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Tell Alexander I&#x27;ll call him when I&#x27;m finished with PR,&quot; Victoria replied.<br/><br/>&quot;Actually,&quot; the assistant clarified, &quot;he was asking for Camille.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria and Camille exchanged glances. Alexander had been mysteriously absent since yesterday&#x27;s crisis began.<br/><br/>&quot;Take the call in my office,&quot; Victoria said. &quot;I&#x27;ll handle PR. We need to get ahead of the board&#x27;s decision before it leaks.&quot;<br/><br/>As they prepared to leave, Victoria paused, her hand on Camille&#x27;s arm. &quot;Remember what I taught you. When enemies surround you...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Trust no one completely,&quot; Camille finished. &quot;Not even allies.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You mean Alexander.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I mean everyone,&quot; Victoria replied. &quot;Including me.&quot;<br/><br/>With that warning, Victoria swept from the room, shoulders back, head high. As board members scurried from her path, Camille noticed something, the slight tremor in Victoria&#x27;s hands, quickly hidden by clenched fists.<br/><br/>The unshakable Victoria Kane was shaken. And that, more than anything else, sent a chill down Camille&#x27;s spine.<br/><br/>She made her way to Victoria&#x27;s office, closing the door firmly behind her. Whatever Alexander wanted, whatever new crisis loomed, she would face it with the same strength she&#x27;d shown in the boardroom.<br/><br/>But as she reached for the phone, she couldn&#x27;t silence the whisper of doubt. If the board could turn on Victoria so quickly, if public opinion could shift against Camille overnight, what other betrayals might be waiting?<br/><br/>Who else might be wielding knives in the dark?v<br/></div>
