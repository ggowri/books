        <h1>Chapter 72-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 72<br/><br/>Camille&#x27;s point of view <br/><br/>I stood in Victoria&#x27;s office, staring at the meticulously crafted guest list on the desk between us. Names neatly typed in three columns, people whose lives would forever change in exactly two weeks&#x27; time. Rose. Stefan. Fashion industry leaders. Business rivals. Society reporters. All unknowingly summoned to witness the final act of a drama two years in the making.<br/><br/>&quot;Are you certain about this?&quot; Victoria asked, her voice carrying none of its usual commanding certainty. &quot;Once we take this step, there&#x27;s no going back.&quot;<br/><br/>I traced my finger down the list, stopping at Richard and Margaret Lewis. The parents who had raised me, then forgotten me when Rose&#x27;s manipulation had proven more compelling than their love.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m certain,&quot; I said, surprised by the steadiness in my voice. &quot;It&#x27;s time for everyone to know the truth.&quot;<br/><br/>After two years of careful planning, of strategic destruction, of watching from the shadows as Rose&#x27;s empire crumbled piece by methodical piece, the moment had arrived for the final revelation. Camille Lewis wasn&#x27;t dead. She had been reborn as Camille Kane, and she had orchestrated the systematic destruction of those who had betrayed her.<br/><br/>Victoria studied me, her sharp eyes missing nothing. &quot;And your motivation? Is this about justice, or is it personal satisfaction?&quot;<br/><br/>The question hung between us, more significant than it might seem. For two years, Victoria had guided my transformation from broken victim to powerful avenger with one consistent warning: emotion clouds judgment. Strategic revenge required cold calculation, not heated passion.<br/><br/>&quot;Both,&quot; I admitted, honesty winning over performance for perhaps the first time since my rebirth. &quot;I want justice. But I also want to see their faces when they realize what&#x27;s happened. Who&#x27;s been behind their destruction.&quot;<br/><br/>Something like approval flickered in Victoria&#x27;s eyes. &quot;At least you&#x27;re honest about it. That&#x27;s progress.&quot;<br/><br/>I moved to the windows overlooking Manhattan&#x27;s skyline. Somewhere in that sprawling city, Rose was hiding in her penthouse, her fashion empire destroyed, her reputation in tatters, her fiancé gone, her godfather&#x27;s company seized. Stefan was fighting to save the last remnants of his shipping business, his family legacy reduced to a single struggling office in Seattle. Both experiencing exactly the helplessness I had felt when they destroyed my life.<br/><br/>&quot;Alexander thinks I should reconsider,&quot; I said, still facing the window.<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s reflection appeared beside mine in the glass. &quot;Does he now? And what are his reasons?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;He believes revealing myself will give Rose power she currently doesn&#x27;t have. Knowledge of who&#x27;s been orchestrating her downfall.&quot; I turned to face Victoria. &quot;He thinks it&#x27;s smarter to let her suffer without ever knowing why.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And what do you think?&quot;<br/><br/>I considered the question carefully. Alexander&#x27;s concern wasn&#x27;t groundless. Rose was dangerous, manipulative, ruthless. Giving her information was giving her a weapon. But something in me needed this final confrontation, needed to stand before her, unveiled, and claim responsibility for her destruction.<br/><br/>&quot;I think some victories need to be witnessed to be complete,&quot; I said finally. &quot;Some truths need to be spoken aloud.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria nodded, moving back to her desk to review the event plans. &quot;Then we&#x27;ll proceed. The Phoenix Gala, two weeks from tonight at the Kane mansion. Ostensibly to announce your appointment as president of our new Tech division.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And actually to reveal that Camille Lewis has returned from the dead,&quot; I finished, a shiver running through me despite my resolve.<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s hand paused over the papers. &quot;There&#x27;s another factor to consider. Once your true identity is revealed, there will be questions. Investigations. Legal complications. The narrative we created about your &#x27;drowning&#x27; will undergo intense scrutiny.&quot;<br/><br/>I&#x27;d thought about this, of course. The police would want statements. Lawyers would raise questions about identity fraud, about insurance claims processed after my &quot;death,&quot; about the legality of assuming a new identity.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m prepared for that,&quot; I said, more confidently than I felt. &quot;The truth about Rose hiring someone to run me off the road will redirect most of the attention. And you have enough legal influence to handle the rest.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s slight smile acknowledged the truth of this. With her resources and connections, any legal complications would ultimately be managed, if not eliminated entirely.<br/><br/>&quot;Then there&#x27;s only one question remaining,&quot; she said, fixing me with her penetrating gaze. &quot;After the reveal. After the satisfaction of seeing their faces. After justice is served. What then?&quot;</div>
