        <h1>Chapter 98-1</h1>
        <div> Chapter 98<br/><br/>Rose stared at the screens covering the wall of Herod Preston&#x27;s penthouse office. Six displays showed different angles of the Phoenix Grid construction site, live feeds that shouldn&#x27;t exist. Workers in yellow hard hats moved across the site like ants, unaware of the predatory eyes watching their every move.<br/><br/>&quot;Your security access is impressive,&quot; Rose said, stepping closer to examine a monitor showing the main control center where engineers hunched over computers. &quot;How did you get these feeds?&quot;<br/><br/>Herod&#x27;s mouth curled into the barest hint of a smile. &quot;Money opens doors. Especially when those doors belong to underpaid security guards with gambling debts.&quot;<br/><br/>He stood beside her, close enough that she could smell his expensive cologne. In the three weeks since they&#x27;d begun working together, Rose had grown to appreciate his attention to detail. Unlike the men she&#x27;d manipulated before, Herod Preston understood the value of patience. Of precision.<br/><br/>&quot;And our man?&quot; she asked, tapping a fingernail against the screen showing workers installing circuit panels.<br/><br/>Herod pressed a button on his desk. The center screen zoomed in on a thin man with ginger hair tucked under his hard hat. &quot;James Walsh. Senior electrician. Twenty years&#x27; experience. Divorced. Two children he rarely sees. Massive debt from his ex-wife&#x27;s medical bills.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose studied the man&#x27;s face. Ordinary. Forgettable. Perfect.<br/><br/>&quot;And he&#x27;s completely bought in?&quot; <br/><br/>&quot;He believes he&#x27;s working for a competitor looking to delay the project.&quot; Herod&#x27;s voice carried the confident tone of someone who had covered every angle. &quot;He has no idea what will really happen when those modified circuits overload.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose felt a thrill race through her body. Not just excitement, something deeper. More primal. For twelve months she had lived in the wreckage of her carefully constructed life. Watching her fashion empire crumble. Feeling her grip on Stefan weaken. All because Camille refused to stay dead.<br/><br/>Now, finally, revenge was within reach.<br/><br/>&quot;Show me the blueprint modifications again,&quot; she said.<br/><br/>Herod slid a tablet across his glass desk. On screen, two sets of technical drawings appeared side by side. To Rose&#x27;s untrained eye, they looked identical, a maze of lines, symbols, and measurements.<br/><br/>&quot;The original is on the left,&quot; Herod explained, pointing to specific sections. &quot;Our version is on the right. The changes are subtle. Temperature sensors adjusted to report normal readings even when heat levels rise dangerously. Circuit breakers modified to allow power surges rather than shutting down. Backup systems reconfigured to fail simultaneously rather than sequentially.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose didn&#x27;t fully understand the technical details, but she understood the result. &quot;And these changes guarantee disaster?&quot;<br/><br/>Herod nodded, eyes gleaming with something that looked unnervingly like excitement. &quot;The system will appear to function normally during testing. The flaws won&#x27;t activate until full power runs through the grid for at least seventy-two hours. By then, the heat buildup in the main junction boxes will be unstoppable.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And the result?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Catastrophic failure. Multiple explosions across the grid network. Blackouts throughout the city. And most importantly...&quot; he tapped the screen where Camille&#x27;s office was located at the Grid headquarters, &quot;....complete destruction of Kane Industries&#x27; reputation. Your sister will be blamed for cutting corners on safety protocols. There will be investigations. Lawsuits. Criminal charges.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose closed her eyes, savoring the mental image. Camille in handcuffs. Victoria Kane&#x27;s empire crumbling. Everything they&#x27;d built reduced to ashes.<br/><br/>&quot;The timing is critical,&quot; Herod continued, moving to the window overlooking the Manhattan skyline. &quot;Walsh installs the modified circuits tomorrow. Final testing begins the day after. The groundbreaking ceremony is in three days.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And then?&quot; Rose joined him at the window.<br/><br/>&quot;And then we wait.&quot; Herod&#x27;s reflection in the glass looked almost predatory. &quot;Three days after the ceremony, the grid goes fully operational. Seventy-two hours after that...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Boom,&quot; Rose whispered.<br/><br/>&quot;Precisely.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose tried to picture Camille&#x27;s face when she realized what was happening. Would she know immediately that Rose was behind it? Or would the confusion and panic keep her from seeing the truth until it was too late?<br/><br/>&quot;There&#x27;s one more thing we need to discuss,&quot; Herod said, turning away from the window. &quot;Walsh.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose frowned. &quot;What about him?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;He&#x27;s a loose end. After the installation is complete, he needs to disappear.&quot;<br/><br/>The coldness in Herod&#x27;s voice sent an unexpected chill through Rose. She had wished Camille dead, had hired men to frighten her into leaving town, but hearing Herod speak so casually about eliminating a man whose only crime was being desperate enough to take their money...<br/><br/>&quot;Is that necessary?&quot; she asked, surprising herself with the question.<br/><br/>Herod studied her face, his expression unreadable. &quot;Having second thoughts, Rose? That seems unlike you.&quot;<br/><br/>His tone held a challenge Rose couldn&#x27;t afford to fail. She straightened her spine, raising her chin. &quot;Not at all. I&#x27;m simply being practical. A dead electrician raises questions.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;A dead electrician in a car accident fifty miles from New York raises no questions at all. Particularly when his blood alcohol level suggests he was drinking heavily.&quot; Herod returned to his desk. &quot;That&#x27;s already arranged. I simply thought you should know.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose nodded, swallowing the unexpected discomfort. This was war. Wars had casualties.<br/><br/>&quot;Any word on Victoria&#x27;s movements?&quot; she asked, changing the subject.<br/><br/>Herod tapped another button. A new screen appeared showing Victoria Kane leaving her building, flanked by security. &quot;She&#x27;s increased surveillance on you. My sources say her security chief is frantically trying to identify me.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Will they succeed?&quot;</div>
