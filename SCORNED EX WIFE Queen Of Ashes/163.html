        <h1>Chapter 109-2</h1>
        <div><br/>Alexander&#x27;s expression had transformed. The jealousy had faded, replaced by reluctant recognition. He believed Stefan. More importantly, he recognized genuine remorse.<br/><br/>&quot;How do we know this isn&#x27;t some elaborate plot?&quot; Victoria asked. &quot;You betrayed Camille once. Why should we believe you won&#x27;t do it again?&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan met her gaze directly. &quot;You shouldn&#x27;t. Trust has to be earned, and I haven&#x27;t earned yours. But I&#x27;m not asking you to trust me. I&#x27;m just offering information.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;If you&#x27;re sincere,&quot; Alexander said, &quot;what else can you provide? Beyond psychological insights.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I know Rose&#x27;s habits. Her favorite places. The people she still trusts.&quot; Stefan straightened slightly. &quot;I could help your security team track her movements, identify meeting places with Preston.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander nodded slowly, calculating the value against the risks. His protective stance relaxed slightly.<br/><br/>Victoria remained unmoved. &quot;While you&#x27;re being so helpful, perhaps you could explain why we should believe you&#x27;re not still working for her interests.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I can&#x27;t prove a negative. All I can tell you is that Rose slapped me hard enough to leave a mark when I confronted her yesterday.&quot; He touched his cheek, where a faint bruise was visible. &quot;She&#x27;s made it clear I&#x27;m her enemy too.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille watched him, searching for the deception she&#x27;d missed years ago. The smooth charm, the practiced sincerity. She found neither. The man before her seemed hollowed out, stripped of pretense.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;d like to speak with Stefan alone,&quot; she said suddenly.<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s head snapped toward her. &quot;Camille...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Just for a few minutes,&quot; Camille insisted. &quot;I think I&#x27;ve earned that right.&quot;<br/><br/>A silent communication passed between them. Finally, Victoria nodded once, sharply.<br/><br/>&quot;Five minutes,&quot; she said, rising. &quot;Not a second more.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander hesitated, torn between respecting Camille&#x27;s wishes and his instinct to shield her. His eyes searched hers.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s okay,&quot; Camille assured him.<br/><br/>With reluctance, Alexander stood. As he passed Stefan, he paused. &quot;If this is some kind of game,&quot; he said, voice low, &quot;if you hurt her again, what Victoria does to you will seem merciful compared to my response.&quot;<br/><br/>When the door closed, a heavy silence filled the room. Camille studied her former husband across the table. So familiar once. Now a stranger.<br/><br/>&quot;Why are you really here, Stefan?&quot; she asked quietly.<br/><br/>&quot;I told you—&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The truth,&quot; Camille cut him off. &quot;Not what sounds noble. The truth.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan&#x27;s shoulders sagged. &quot;Because I can&#x27;t live with myself otherwise,&quot; he whispered. &quot;Because I wake up every night seeing your face when you found those divorce papers. Because when I thought you were dead, I realized what I&#x27;d done. Who I&#x27;d become.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille absorbed his words without expression. &quot;And now? What do you want from this?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Nothing from you,&quot; Stefan said, meeting her eyes. &quot;I don&#x27;t expect forgiveness. I just want to do one right thing. To help stop Rose before she hurts more people.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;If we use your information, I need to know you won&#x27;t waver. That you won&#x27;t change your mind if Rose reaches out again.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I won&#x27;t,&quot; Stefan said firmly. &quot;I&#x27;ve seen who she really is now. There&#x27;s no going back.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria and Alexander returned precisely five minutes later. Alexander&#x27;s eyes immediately sought Camille&#x27;s, checking for signs of distress.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;ll accept your assistance,&quot; Camille announced. &quot;You&#x27;ll work with Alexander&#x27;s security team, not directly with us. Every piece of information will be verified. Every move watched.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I understand,&quot; Stefan said, relief washing over his face.<br/><br/>&quot;If this is some kind of trap,&quot; Victoria added icily, &quot;understand that I will personally ensure you regret it.&quot;<br/><br/>For the next hour, they extracted every detail Stefan could offer about Rose, her habits, her thought patterns, the places she might go, the people she still trusted. Alexander recorded everything, his initial jealousy forgotten as he focused on the tactical value of Stefan&#x27;s information.<br/><br/>Victoria remained cool and distant, her skepticism evident in every question. But even she couldn&#x27;t deny the value of what Stefan provided.<br/><br/>When they finished, Stefan stood to leave. At the door, he paused.<br/><br/>&quot;For what it&#x27;s worth,&quot; he said quietly, &quot;I am sorry. For everything.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded once, neither accepting nor rejecting his apology. She watched him walk away, the ghost of the man she had married.<br/><br/>When the door closed, Victoria turned to Camille. &quot;Do you believe him?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I believe he wants to help,&quot; Camille said carefully. &quot;Whether he has the strength to follow through... that&#x27;s another question.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;His insights about Rose match what we&#x27;ve observed,&quot; Alexander admitted. &quot;And his remorse seemed genuine.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;People can fake remorse,&quot; Victoria reminded them.<br/><br/>&quot;True.&quot; Alexander&#x27;s eyes met Camille&#x27;s. &quot;But I think Stefan Rodriguez has finally seen himself clearly. And he doesn&#x27;t like what he sees.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria remained unconvinced. &quot;We&#x27;ll use his information, but carefully. Trust, but verify.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille moved to the window to stare out at the city. Three days until the Grid launch. Three days until whatever Rose and Herod had planned would unfold.<br/><br/>&quot;If Stefan is right about Rose needing to witness suffering,&quot; she said, &quot;then she&#x27;ll be at the launch ceremony. She and Preston both.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Which gives us an opportunity,&quot; Alexander finished her thought. &quot;We can prepare for them.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille turned back to face them, a new resolve forming inside her. For too long, she had been reacting to Rose&#x27;s moves. Perhaps it was time to change the game.<br/><br/>&quot;Rose thinks she knows me,&quot; Camille said quietly. &quot;She thinks she knows exactly how I&#x27;ll respond. What I&#x27;ll do. Who I&#x27;ll trust.&quot; A small smile touched her lips. &quot;Let&#x27;s show her how wrong she is.&quot;<br/><br/>As they began planning, Camille caught Alexander watching her with an expression she hadn&#x27;t seen before, pride mixed with something deeper. The jealousy that had flickered when Stefan first spoke had transformed into quiet admiration of her strength.<br/><br/>And Camille realized something as she watched him back. Stefan&#x27;s presence had clarified something important: the difference between the man who had betrayed her and the man who now stood beside her. Between a love built on convenience and a bond forged through fire.<br/><br/>Three days until they faced Rose and Herod.<br/>Three days to prepare for whatever came next.<br/>Three days to turn a desperate plan for sabotage into a trap for its creators.<br/></div>
