        <h1>Chapter 143-2</h1>
        <div><br/>The sirens screamed into the parking lot outside, red and blue lights flashing through the thin curtains. Car doors slammed. Voices shouted commands.<br/><br/>Rose didn&#x27;t have time for a clean shot anymore. She needed to run.<br/><br/>She fired once more, the bullet striking the floor beside Herod&#x27;s head. Not a kill shot, but enough to make her point. &quot;This isn&#x27;t over,&quot; she hissed, then turned and ran for the bathroom window.<br/><br/>It was small, but Rose was smaller. She forced it open and squeezed through, dropping into the narrow alley behind the motel. Her car was out front, now blocked by FBI vehicles. She&#x27;d have to find another way out.<br/><br/>Behind her, shouts came from the motel room. They&#x27;d found Herod. Soon they&#x27;d be looking for her.<br/><br/>Rose ran through the alley, away from the motel, away from the sirens, away from the man she&#x27;d shot but not killed. Her mind raced with possibilities, contingency plans forming and dissolving with each step.<br/><br/>Herod might survive. He might tell them everything. But without the recorder, without proof, it would be his word against hers. And Rose had always been very good at making people believe her.<br/><br/>She&#x27;d need a new identity. New papers. Money. She&#x27;d had all of that arranged already, in case their plan went wrong. In case they needed to disappear after destroying Camille and Victoria Kane.<br/><br/>Now she&#x27;d use those preparations to save herself.<br/><br/>Rose slowed to a walk as she reached a busier street. She couldn&#x27;t look like she was running. Couldn&#x27;t draw attention to herself. She smoothed her hair, adjusted her clothing, and wiped the fear from her face. The gun went back into her bag, hidden beneath a scarf.<br/><br/>A taxi approached. Rose raised her hand, forcing her most charming smile.<br/><br/>&quot;Where to?&quot; the driver asked as she slid into the back seat.<br/><br/>&quot;Bus station,&quot; Rose said. &quot;I&#x27;ve got a long journey ahead.&quot;<br/><br/>As the taxi pulled away, Rose watched police cars speed past in the opposite direction. More units responding to the shooting. More people who would soon be looking for her.<br/><br/>She leaned back against the seat, forcing her breathing to slow, forcing her mind to focus. This wasn&#x27;t over. She could still win. She just needed to adapt. To evolve her plan.<br/><br/>Herod had been a tool. A useful one, but replaceable. She&#x27;d find another way to destroy Camille. Another path to the life that should have been hers all along.<br/><br/>And if Herod lived? If he told them everything?<br/><br/>Rose touched the gun in her bag, her finger tracing its deadly shape through the fabric.<br/><br/>Then she&#x27;d just have to silence him permanently. Him and anyone else who stood in her way.<br/><br/>The FBI would be watching airports, train stations, bus terminals. They&#x27;d have her photo, her description. But Rose Lewis had disappeared before. Had become someone new. She could do it again.<br/><br/>For now, she needed to get out of the city. To vanish until the hunt died down. And then, when they least expected it, she would return.<br/><br/>After all, she still had unfinished business with Camille.<br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>Special Agent Diana Chen crouched beside the bleeding man on the motel room floor. The medical team worked frantically to stabilize him, their hands moving with practiced efficiency.<br/><br/>&quot;Three gunshot wounds to the chest,&quot; one of them reported. &quot;He&#x27;s losing blood fast.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Can he talk?&quot; Chen asked.<br/><br/>The medic shook his head. &quot;Not now. Maybe not ever.&quot;<br/><br/>Chen stood, surveying the room. Three bullet holes in the door. Shell casings on the carpet near the entrance. Signs of a hasty departure through the bathroom window.<br/><br/>&quot;Rose Lewis,&quot; said Agent Morgan, joining her. &quot;Room&#x27;s registered under her name. Paid cash for three nights.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;She was careless,&quot; Chen remarked.<br/><br/>&quot;Or in a hurry.&quot; Morgan pointed to the open drawers, clothes strewn about. &quot;They left in a rush. Split up when he decided to turn himself in.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And she decided to shut him up permanently.&quot; Chen&#x27;s eyes fell on the phone on the floor beside the victim. &quot;Was he still connected when we arrived?&quot;<br/><br/>Morgan nodded. &quot;Call to the FBI tip line. Operator said he identified himself as Herod Preston, said he wanted to turn himself in. Then she heard gunshots and the line went dead.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;So she shot him to keep him from talking.&quot; Chen looked at the man being loaded onto a stretcher, an oxygen mask covering his face, IV lines already running into his arms. &quot;But she failed. He&#x27;s still alive.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;For now,&quot; Morgan said grimly. &quot;Doctor says it&#x27;s fifty-fifty at best.&quot;<br/><br/>Chen watched as the medical team rushed Preston out to the waiting ambulance. &quot;Put guards on him at the hospital. If he wakes up, I want to be the first person he talks to.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Already arranged.&quot; Morgan handed her an evidence bag containing a phone. &quot;Found this in his jacket pocket. Tech team&#x27;s working on it now.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And the woman? Rose Lewis?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;APB is out. Every law enforcement agency in the state is looking for her.&quot; Morgan&#x27;s face hardened. &quot;She won&#x27;t get far.&quot;<br/><br/>Chen wasn&#x27;t so sure. Women like Rose Lewis, women who could shoot a man three times and still have the presence of mind to escape through a bathroom window, were dangerous precisely because they were resourceful. Adaptable.<br/><br/>&quot;Check the surrounding buildings for security cameras,&quot; Chen ordered. &quot;Traffic cams too. I want to know which direction she went.&quot;<br/><br/>As the team dispersed to carry out her instructions, Chen stood in the center of the room, trying to read the story written in blood and bullet holes.<br/><br/>Herod Preston had been ready to confess. To implicate Rose Lewis in the bombings. And she had tried to kill him for it.<br/><br/>What had Preston been about to reveal? What secrets was Rose Lewis willing to kill for?<br/><br/>Chen didn&#x27;t know yet. But she would find out. And when she did, Rose Lewis would have nowhere left to hide.<br/><br/>The chase was on.<br/></div>
