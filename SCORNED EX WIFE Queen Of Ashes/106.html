        <h1>Chapter 76-2</h1>
        <div><br/>Camille studied him, this man she had once loved beyond reason. She could see the desperation in his eyes, the genuine misery. There was a time when his pain would have been her pain, when she would have done anything to ease his suffering.<br/><br/>That time was gone.<br/><br/>&quot;Do you know what I remember most about our marriage, Stefan?&quot; she asked quietly. &quot;Not the happy moments. Not the trips or the gifts or the fancy dinners. I remember sitting alone on our anniversary, waiting for you to come home. I remember making excuses for you to my friends when you canceled our plans. I remember the way you would look through me sometimes, like I wasn&#x27;t even there.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I was a terrible husband,&quot; Stefan admitted, his voice breaking. &quot;But people change. I&#x27;ve changed.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Have you?&quot; Camille tilted her head. &quot;Or have your circumstances changed? You&#x27;ve lost your company. Your reputation is in tatters. Rose has shown her true colors. And suddenly, conveniently, you remember your love for me?&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan flinched as if she&#x27;d slapped him. &quot;That&#x27;s not fair.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Isn&#x27;t it? Tell me something, Stefan. If none of this had happened, if I hadn&#x27;t &#x27;died,&#x27; if your business was still thriving, if Rose was still the woman you thought she was, would you be here right now, begging for a second chance? Or would you be planning your wedding with her?&quot;<br/><br/>His silence was answer enough.<br/><br/>Camille stood up, smoothing her skirt with steady hands. &quot;You don&#x27;t love me, Stefan. You never did. Not really. You loved the idea of me, the supportive wife, the pretty accessory, the woman who never challenged you or made you uncomfortable. That woman doesn&#x27;t exist anymore. She died the night I found your divorce papers.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You&#x27;re wrong,&quot; Stefan said, standing too, his voice gaining strength. &quot;Yes, I was blind and selfish then. But these past months without you... thinking you were dead... it changed me, Camille. And seeing you again, knowing what you went through because of me....&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Because of Rose,&quot; she corrected.<br/><br/>&quot;Because of both of us,&quot; he insisted. &quot;I may not have hired those men, but I created the situation that led to it. I share the blame. And I have to live with that for the rest of my life.&quot;<br/><br/>For a moment, Camille saw something genuine in his eyes, real remorse, real pain. But it wasn&#x27;t enough. It would never be enough.<br/><br/>&quot;I believe that you&#x27;re sorry,&quot; she said finally. &quot;And I meant what I said at the gala, I forgive you. Not for your sake, but for mine. I refuse to carry the weight of hating you anymore.&quot;<br/><br/>Hope flickered across his face. &quot;Then....&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;But forgiveness isn&#x27;t the same as forgetting,&quot; she continued. &quot;And it certainly doesn&#x27;t mean a second chance. There are some things that, once broken, can never be fixed.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Camille, please.&quot; Stefan moved around the desk, dropping to his knees beside her chair. The gesture was so unexpected, so unlike the proud man she had known, that she didn&#x27;t back away. &quot;I&#x27;ll do anything. Anything at all. Just tell me what I need to do to make things right. I can&#x27;t lose you again.&quot;<br/><br/>Looking down at him, Camille felt a strange mixture of pity and disgust. &quot;You already lost me, Stefan. A long time ago. You just didn&#x27;t notice until it was too late.&quot;<br/><br/>She stood, forcing him to rise as well. &quot;Our story is over. It ended the moment you decided Rose was more important than our vows. What came after, my &#x27;death,&#x27; my transformation, your company&#x27;s downfall, none of that changes the simple truth that we&#x27;re done.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I don&#x27;t accept that,&quot; Stefan said, a flash of his old stubbornness showing through. &quot;I know I hurt you. I know I don&#x27;t deserve another chance. But I also know what we had was real. And if there&#x27;s even a tiny part of you that remembers what we meant to each other...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What we had wasn&#x27;t real,&quot; Camille cut him off, her voice gentle but firm. &quot;It was a lie. You were with my sister before me, during our marriage, and you&#x27;d still be with her now if the truth hadn&#x27;t come out. That&#x27;s not love, Stefan. That&#x27;s convenience.&quot;<br/><br/>Her words seemed to hit him physically, and he staggered back a step. &quot;You can&#x27;t mean that. You can&#x27;t believe that everything we shared was false.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What I believe doesn&#x27;t matter anymore.&quot; Camille moved toward the door, making it clear the conversation was ending. &quot;What matters is that I&#x27;ve moved on. I&#x27;ve built a new life, a new identity. And you have no place in it.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan didn&#x27;t move, his shoulders slumped in defeat. &quot;I won&#x27;t give up, Camille. Not this time. I&#x27;ll prove to you that I&#x27;ve changed, that I can be the man you deserve.&quot;<br/><br/>A small, sad smile touched her lips. &quot;That&#x27;s the thing, Stefan. I no longer need a man to make me whole. I don&#x27;t need you, or anyone, to &#x27;complete&#x27; me. The woman who defined herself by her husband died in that parking garage. The woman standing before you is complete on her own.&quot;<br/><br/>She opened her office door, where Rebecca was waiting as instructed. &quot;Rebecca will show you out. Please don&#x27;t send any more flowers. Don&#x27;t call. Don&#x27;t come here again. It&#x27;s over, Stefan. Accept that and move on with your life. I already have with mine.&quot;<br/><br/>Something in her tone must have finally reached him, because the fight seemed to drain from his body. He walked toward the door, then paused beside her.<br/><br/>&quot;I really did love you, Camille,&quot; he whispered. &quot;In my own flawed, selfish way. I just wish I had realized what that meant before it was too late.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille met his gaze one last time, seeing the ghost of the man she had once thought would be her forever. &quot;Goodbye, Stefan.&quot;<br/><br/>He nodded once, accepting her dismissal, and followed Rebecca toward the elevator. Camille watched him go, waiting for some flicker of regret, some pull of old feelings.<br/><br/>There was nothing.<br/><br/>Back in her office, she walked to the window overlooking the city. The woman she had been, Camille Lewis, devoted wife, perfect daughter, loving sister, would have crumbled at Stefan&#x27;s pleas. She would have forgiven him instantly, welcomed him back with open arms, grateful for the second chance.<br/><br/>But that woman was gone, burned away in the fire of betrayal and reborn as someone stronger, someone who valued herself too much to accept scraps of affection from a man who had discarded her so easily.<br/><br/>Camille Kane turned back to her desk, to the contracts awaiting her signature, to the empire she was helping to build. The past was finally, truly behind her. Whatever came next, whether it was success or failure, joy or pain, it would be on her terms, not defined by the people who had once claimed to love her.<br/><br/>For the first time since the night everything changed, Camille felt truly free.<br/></div>
