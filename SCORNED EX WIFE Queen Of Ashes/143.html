        <h1>Chapter 99-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 99:<br/><br/>Morning sunlight bathed the construction site in golden light as hundreds gathered for the Phoenix Grid groundbreaking ceremony. Camera crews swarmed like bees, jostling for position around the stage erected at the center of what would soon become the most advanced power distribution hub in the country. Massive red banners bearing the Kane Industries logo and the Phoenix Grid emblem fluttered in the spring breeze.<br/><br/>Behind the stage, in a temporary structure serving as a preparation area, Camille stared at her reflection in a full-length mirror. Her cream-colored suit was impeccable, her makeup flawless, the perfect corporate image Victoria had taught her to project. Yet beneath this polished exterior, unease churned in her stomach.<br/><br/>Hannah Zhao, the chief engineer, poked her head through the doorway. &quot;Five minutes, Ms. Kane.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded, adjusting the phoenix pin on her lapel. Even after discovering the blueprint discrepancies, Victoria had insisted the ceremony proceed as planned. &quot;We don&#x27;t show weakness,&quot; she had declared. &quot;We adapt. We strengthen what was vulnerable. And we never, ever let our enemies know we&#x27;ve spotted them.&quot;<br/><br/>The door opened again. Alexander entered, handsome in a navy suit, his presence immediately filling the small space.<br/><br/>&quot;Nervous?&quot; he asked, coming to stand behind her.<br/><br/>Their eyes met in the mirror. &quot;Not about the speech,&quot; Camille admitted. &quot;But knowing Rose is out there somewhere, watching, planning...&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander rested his hands lightly on her shoulders. Through the fabric of her suit jacket, his touch sent warmth spreading across her skin.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;ve triple-checked the modifications to Hannah&#x27;s designs,&quot; he reminded her. &quot;The sabotage attempt failed. The Grid is safe.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;For now.&quot; Camille turned to face him. &quot;But Rose won&#x27;t stop. Neither will her mystery partner. And we still don&#x27;t know who he is.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s jaw tightened. &quot;My team is close to identifying him. Very close.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You&#x27;ll tell me as soon as you know?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Immediately,&quot; he promised, though something flickered in his eye, a hesitation so brief Camille almost missed it.<br/><br/>A production assistant tapped on the door. &quot;Ms. Kane? We&#x27;re ready for you.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille took a deep breath, centering herself. Alexander caught her hand.<br/><br/>&quot;Remember,&quot; he said softly, &quot;this is about more than beating Rose. This is your vision. Your creation.&quot;<br/><br/>She squeezed his fingers, drawing strength from his steadiness. &quot;Our creation,&quot; she corrected.<br/><br/>Together they walked out into the sunlight, where hundreds of faces turned toward them. Camera flashes popped like lightning strikes. Reporters called out questions that blended into unintelligible noise. On the stage, Victoria stood at the podium, commanding attention with her mere presence despite her recent haggard appearance.<br/><br/>&quot;Ladies and gentlemen,&quot; Victoria&#x27;s voice rang out over the crowd. &quot;Today marks not just the beginning of a revolutionary power grid that will transform New York&#x27;s energy future. It also represents the culmination of a vision, a vision carried forward by my daughter and heir, Camille Kane.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria gestured toward Camille, who ascended the steps to wild applause. For a heartbeat, standing beside Victoria, Camille flashed back to twenty three months ago, broken, bleeding in a parking garage, her life shattered by betrayal. The journey from that moment to this stage seemed impossible, yet here she stood.<br/><br/>As Victoria stepped aside, Camille approached the microphone. The crowd hushed. Hundreds of eyes fixed on her face. Somewhere in that sea of humanity, Camille knew, Rose might be watching. Waiting for her to fail.<br/><br/>&quot;Thank you all for coming today,&quot; Camille began, her voice steady despite the storm of emotions inside her. &quot;The Phoenix Grid represents more than sustainable energy. It embodies something I believe in deeply, ttransformation.&quot;<br/><br/>In the front row, Alexander watched her, his presence a silent anchor. Beside him sat the mayor, the governor, and tech industry titans who had invested in the project.<br/><br/>&quot;We named this project after the phoenix for a reason,&quot; Camille continued. &quot;In mythology, the phoenix burns completely, reduced to ashes, yet rises again, not just restored, but made stronger by the very fire that consumed it.&quot;<br/><br/>Her eyes swept across the crowd, making brief contact with individuals, connecting with them just as Victoria had taught her.<br/><br/>&quot;Many of you know that Kane Industries faced challenges bringing this project to fruition. There were those who said it couldn&#x27;t be done. Those who actively worked against us.&quot;<br/><br/>A murmur ran through the crowd. Everyone remembered the stock manipulation, the media attacks, the sabotage attempts that had made headlines.<br/><br/>&quot;But like the phoenix, we didn&#x27;t just survive those challenges, we transformed them into opportunities. Each obstacle forced us to innovate, to strengthen our designs, to build something better than we had originally conceived.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille paused, letting her words sink in. In the distance, beyond the crowd, she caught sight of a flash of movement, a woman with dark glasses slipping behind a construction vehicle. Her heart jumped. Rose?</div>
