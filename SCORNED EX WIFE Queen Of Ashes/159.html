        <h1>Chapter 107-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 107<br/><br/>The restaurant occupied the entire top floor of a Midtown hotel, overlooking Central Park. Camille arrived fifteen minutes early, a tactic Victoria had taught her, secure the position of power, choose your seat, control the encounter from the first moment.<br/><br/>She selected a corner table with her back to the wall, facing both elevators. The host seated her with a professional smile, leaving her alone with her thoughts and a sparkling water she wouldn&#x27;t drink.<br/><br/>Camille smoothed her navy dress, a simple design that concealed the tension in her body. The silver rose pendant Alexander had returned to her hung at her throat, a reminder of who she had been before Rose&#x27;s betrayal, before Victoria&#x27;s transformation.<br/><br/>Her phone buzzed with a text from Alexander: *Everything okay?*<br/><br/>She typed: *They haven&#x27;t arrived yet.*<br/><br/>*I&#x27;m in the lobby if you need me.*<br/><br/>A small smile touched her lips. Alexander hadn&#x27;t questioned her decision to face her parents alone, but he&#x27;d insisted on accompanying her to the hotel. Her shield, waiting in the background.<br/><br/>The elevator doors opened, and Camille&#x27;s smile vanished. Her stomach tightened into a knot.<br/><br/>Margaret and Richard Lewis stepped into the restaurant, looking smaller than she remembered. Her mother scanned the space, hands clutched around her purse. Her father stood slightly behind, his shoulders rounded in a way Camille had never seen before.<br/><br/>They spotted her. Hesitated. Then walked toward her table with careful steps.<br/><br/>Camille did not stand. Did not smile. Did not offer her cheek for the kiss her mother leaned in to give before thinking better of it.<br/><br/>&quot;Camille,&quot; Margaret said, the name catching in her throat. &quot;Thank you for, for agreeing to meet us.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Please,&quot; Richard gestured to the chairs. &quot;May we sit?&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded, her face revealing nothing. Victoria would have been proud.<br/><br/>They settled awkwardly, all the social graces they&#x27;d drilled into her now useless in the face of their broken relationship.<br/><br/>&quot;You look well,&quot; her mother tried. &quot;Healthy.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I am,&quot; Camille kept her voice neutral. &quot;Victoria takes good care of her investments.&quot;<br/><br/>Her mother flinched at the word &quot;investments.&quot; Her father cleared his throat.<br/><br/>&quot;Camille, we...&quot; Richard began.<br/><br/>&quot;Why did you want to meet?&quot; Camille cut him off. Direct. No small talk.<br/><br/>Her parents exchanged glances. Margaret nodded slightly, and Richard reached down for a leather satchel he&#x27;d placed beside his chair. He removed a flat package wrapped in blue cloth and placed it on the table.<br/><br/>&quot;We wanted to give you these,&quot; he said. &quot;They&#x27;re yours. They&#x27;ve always been yours.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille didn&#x27;t touch the package. &quot;What is it?&quot;<br/><br/>Margaret&#x27;s eyes filled with tears. &quot;Your journals. From when you were a girl. Before... Before Rose came.&quot;<br/><br/>The words hit Camille like a physical blow. Her journals. The ones Rose had found and read aloud mockingly. The ones that had disappeared after her &quot;accident.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You kept them?&quot; Camille couldn&#x27;t hide her surprise.<br/><br/>&quot;We found them when we were cleaning out your old room,&quot; Richard explained. &quot;After your... after the news about your car in the river. We couldn&#x27;t bear to throw them away.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille looked at the package, still not touching it. &quot;And now you want to return them because you know I&#x27;m alive.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No,&quot; Margaret shook her head, a tear spilling down her cheek. &quot;We want to return them because we&#x27;ve read them. All of them. And we...&quot; Her voice broke completely.<br/><br/>Richard covered his wife&#x27;s hand with his own. &quot;We failed you, Camille. In ways we&#x27;re only beginning to understand. Your journals, they show a pattern we were too blind to see.&quot;<br/><br/>A server approached, sensing the tension. Camille requested water for the table and said they weren&#x27;t ready to order.<br/><br/>When the server left, she reached for the package, unwrapping it with careful fingers. Inside lay five notebooks of different colors and sizes. Her childhood handwriting filled their pages.<br/><br/>&quot;What pattern?&quot; Camille asked, though she already knew.<br/><br/>Margaret wiped her tears. &quot;How Rose manipulated all of us. How we always took her side. How we...punished you for things that weren&#x27;t your fault.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Read the green one,&quot; Richard said softly. &quot;Page twenty-three.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille hesitated, then opened the small green notebook. Her thirteen-year-old self had written:<br/><br/>*Mom yelled at me again for making Rose feel unwelcome. But I DIDN&#x27;T. I asked her to come to the movies with me and Jenna, and she said yes, and then she didn&#x27;t show up. And when I got home, she told Mom I left without her on purpose. Why doesn&#x27;t Mom ever believe me? Rose smiled when Mom sent me to my room. She SMILED. Like she PLANNED it.*<br/><br/>The memory flooded back, waiting in the lobby for Rose, who never came. The sick feeling knowing what would happen when she got home. The helplessness of not being believed.<br/><br/>&quot;There are dozens of entries like that,&quot; Margaret said, her voice hollow with regret. &quot;So many times we took Rose&#x27;s word over yours.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille closed the journal. &quot;Why are you showing me this now?&quot;</div>
