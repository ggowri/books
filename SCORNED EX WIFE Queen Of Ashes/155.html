        <h1>Chapter 105-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 105<br/><br/>Victoria Kane sat alone in her office, the glow from her computer screen the only light in the room. Outside her windows, dawn painted the Manhattan skyline in hues of pink and gold, but she hadn&#x27;t noticed the sunrise. She hadn&#x27;t moved from her chair in hours.<br/><br/>On her screen, financial records filled page after page, stock purchases, company acquisitions, shell corporations nested within shell corporations like Russian dolls. A tangled web of financial transactions that had taken her team of investigators days to unravel.<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s mouth tightened as she scrolled through the data. The pattern was unmistakable once you knew what to look for. Small stock purchases, never more than one percent at a time. Different buyer names. Different banks. Different countries. But all ultimately tracing back to one man.<br/><br/>Herod Preston.<br/><br/>She slammed her hand against the desk, the sharp crack echoing through the empty office. Victoria Kane did not lose control. Not ever. But seeing Herod&#x27;s name, the son of the man who had killed her daughter, attached to her company set her blood boiling.<br/><br/>Her intercom buzzed. &quot;Ms. Kane? Mr. Pierce is here.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria took a deep breath, smoothing her features into their usual mask of calm. &quot;Send him in.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander entered, impeccable as always in a tailored suit despite the early hour. His expression shifted when he saw her face.<br/><br/>&quot;You found something,&quot; he said, closing the door behind him.<br/><br/>Victoria swiveled her computer screen toward him. &quot;Herod Preston has been buying Kane Industries stock for the past six months.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander crossed to her desk, studying the financial data. &quot;Through shell companies. Clever. Staying under the radar.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Clever?&quot; Victoria&#x27;s voice sharpened. &quot;He&#x27;s infiltrating my company, Alexander.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;How much has he acquired?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Just over five percent, according to what we&#x27;ve traced so far.&quot; Victoria stood, too agitated to remain seated. &quot;He&#x27;s positioning himself for a hostile takeover.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander leaned closer to the screen, scrolling through the transactions. &quot;Pequod Ventures, Ahab Holdings, Queequeg Capital... all literature references. Easier to track than he thinks.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This isn&#x27;t a literary analysis, Alexander.&quot; Victoria paced behind her desk. &quot;This is Herod Preston making his next move against me. Against my family. First the Grid sabotage, now this.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander straightened, his expression serious. &quot;Victoria, he can&#x27;t take Kane Industries from you. You personally own sixty percent of the company.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m aware of my stock holdings,&quot; she snapped.<br/><br/>&quot;And I&#x27;ve recently acquired ten percent,&quot; Alexander continued, unfazed by her tone. &quot;Which means that even if Herod managed to buy every remaining share, which he can&#x27;t without triggering SEC notifications he would still be a minority shareholder.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria paused her pacing. She knew this. Of course she knew this. She had structured her company holdings precisely to prevent hostile takeovers. But the sight of Herod Preston&#x27;s name connected to Kane Industries had triggered something primal in her, a mother&#x27;s rage at the family that had taken her daughter.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s not about the stock,&quot; she said finally. &quot;It&#x27;s about his audacity. His... invasion. After what his family did to Sophia.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s expression softened slightly. &quot;I understand. But we need to think strategically. If Herod is buying stock, it means he&#x27;s planning for something beyond the Grid sabotage.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria moved to the window, watching the city come to life below. She knew Alexander was right. This wasn&#x27;t just about emotion, it was about chess moves, strategy, seeing ten steps ahead.<br/><br/>&quot;He wants inside information,&quot; she said. &quot;Board meeting minutes. Financial projections. Access to shareholder communications.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Exactly,&quot; Alexander agreed. &quot;And he&#x27;ll use a proxy to request that information once he reaches the five percent threshold that requires public disclosure.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria turned back to face him, her mind racing through scenarios. &quot;We need to identify his proxy before they make a move. And we need to know how much stock he actually owns.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander was already typing on his phone. &quot;I&#x27;ll have my team dig deeper. There may be other shell companies we haven&#x27;t traced yet.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Good. And have them check recent trading patterns in Kane Industries stock. He may be accelerating his purchases now that the Grid launch is imminent.&quot; Victoria returned to her desk, her momentary loss of control now replaced with cold calculation. &quot;If Herod thinks he can use my company against me, he&#x27;ll discover just how wrong he is.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander pocketed his phone. &quot;There&#x27;s another angle we should consider.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Which is?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;If his stock purchases are discovered—and they will be, because we&#x27;ve found them, Herod will assume we&#x27;re focused on protecting the company from takeover.&quot; Alexander&#x27;s eyes met hers. &quot;Which may distract us from whatever his actual plan might be.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria considered this. &quot;A diversion.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Possibly. The Grid sabotage. The stock purchases. What if neither is his primary goal?&quot; Alexander crossed to the coffeemaker in the corner of Victoria&#x27;s office, pouring two cups. &quot;Herod strikes me as a man who always has multiple strategies in play.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria accepted the coffee he offered, warming her hands around the cup. &quot;Like a chess master sacrificing pieces to disguise his true objective.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Exactly.&quot; Alexander took a sip of his coffee. &quot;We need to ask ourselves: what would hurt you the most? Not just financially, but personally?&quot;<br/><br/>The question hung in the air between them. Victoria knew the answer immediately, though she would never say it aloud. There was only one thing left in this world that could truly destroy her.</div>
