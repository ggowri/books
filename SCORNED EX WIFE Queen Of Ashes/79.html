        <h1>Chapter 60-2</h1>
        <div><br/>Stefan took the envelope, his name written in elegant handwriting that stirred something in his memory. The paper felt heavy, like a tombstone in his hands.<br/><br/>After the Kane representatives left, silence descended. The board members looked to Stefan with devastation in their eyes.<br/><br/>&quot;This meeting is adjourned,&quot; Stefan said quietly. &quot;HR will prepare separation packages. Legal will handle the wind-down procedures.&quot; His voice caught. &quot;It has been an honor working with each of you.&quot;<br/><br/>One by one they filed out, some stopping to shake his hand, others too overwhelmed to manage more than a nod. When the last had gone, Stefan remained alone in the boardroom where generations of Rodriguez men had built an empire now reduced to ashes.<br/><br/>Camille watched him on her screen, her heart thundering against her ribs. This was the moment she&#x27;d planned so meticulously. The message that would begin to unravel the mystery for him. That would start him questioning who had destroyed him and why.<br/><br/>Stefan opened the envelope with trembling fingers, removing a single sheet of heavy cream paper. The message was brief:<br/><br/>*Some debts can&#x27;t be measured in dollars and cents.<br/>Some losses can&#x27;t be repaid with anything but complete surrender.<br/>Ask yourself what you took that was beyond price.*<br/><br/>Confusion gave way to dread, a cold sweat breaking across his forehead. Not a business communication. A personal one. This wasn&#x27;t just acquisition. This was targeted revenge.<br/><br/>But for what? Against whom?<br/><br/>His phone buzzed with a news alert: &quot;KANE INDUSTRIES ACQUIRES RODRIGUEZ SHIPPING ASSETS IN HOSTILE TAKEOVER.&quot;<br/><br/>The accompanying photo showed Camille Kane touring properties. Something about her profile, about the way she tilted her head slightly, sent an electric shock of recognition through him. A memory trying to surface.<br/><br/>He stared at her image, the elegant woman with the sharp cheekbones and confident stance. Something about her eyes...<br/><br/>Camille watched his face, saw the moment confusion began shifting toward suspicion. Not full understanding yet, the surgical changes to her appearance prevented that. But the first seeds of recognition. Of questions.<br/><br/>Her phone vibrated with Victoria&#x27;s text: *Is it done?*<br/><br/>*Yes,* she replied, hands shaking slightly. *Complete financial ruin. He just received my note.*<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s response: *Perfect. The first phase of justice is complete.*<br/><br/>Camille returned her attention to the screen where Stefan sat alone, head in his hands, the carefully maintained facade finally cracking. The sight should have filled her with joy. Should have satisfied the hunger for justice that had defined her existence since the night Stefan had handed her divorce papers on their anniversary.<br/><br/>Instead, watching him break apart in private brought a hollow ache to her chest. This man had destroyed her without remorse. Had discarded her for her sister. He deserved this pain. This loss.<br/><br/>So why did victory taste so bitter?<br/><br/>Stefan suddenly looked up, gaze sweeping the room, pausing at the security camera. For a moment, it felt as though he was looking directly at her.<br/><br/>&quot;Victoria Kane,&quot; he whispered, voice raw with confusion. &quot;What did we do to you?&quot;<br/><br/>Yet something in his expression suggested that deep in his mind, something was stirring. Not understanding, not yet. But the faintest echo of recognition, buried too deep for him to grasp.<br/><br/>Camille switched off the tablet, hands unsteady. Her phone buzzed.... Alexander this time.<br/><br/>*The phoenix strikes, but finds the fire burns both ways. When you&#x27;re ready to discuss what comes after revenge, I&#x27;ll be waiting.*<br/><br/>How did he always know exactly what she was feeling, when no one else could see beneath her carefully constructed facade?<br/><br/>Camille gathered her things, preparing to slip away unseen. Victoria would be waiting, eager to hear every detail of Stefan&#x27;s suffering.<br/><br/>But something had changed inside her. Some shift she hadn&#x27;t anticipated.<br/><br/>Stefan Rodriguez was broken. His company destroyed. His family legacy erased.<br/><br/>Complete victory.<br/><br/>So why did she feel so empty?<br/><br/>As she moved toward the door, Camille caught her reflection, the perfect exterior of Camille Kane, Victoria&#x27;s heir, avenger.<br/><br/>But beneath that polished surface, something of Camille Lewis remained. Something that whispered uncomfortable questions about what came next. About who she would be when revenge no longer defined her purpose.<br/><br/>Yet as she slipped from the building, his confused question echoed in her mind, haunting her moment of triumph with unexpected doubt.<br/></div>
