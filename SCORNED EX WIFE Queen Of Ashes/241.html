        <h1>Chapter 156-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 156<br/><br/>The hospital room was too quiet. Only the steady beep of monitors and the whisper of the oxygen machine broke the silence. Camille sat beside Victoria&#x27;s bed, her hand gently holding the older woman&#x27;s fragile fingers. Three days had passed since the bombing. Three days of watching Victoria struggle, hour by hour.<br/><br/>The doctors had explained it in simple terms at first: Victoria&#x27;s body, already fighting cancer, couldn&#x27;t handle the additional strain of smoke inhalation and shock. Her lungs were struggling. Her heart was weakening. Each breath seemed to cost her more than the last.<br/><br/>Camille leaned forward, studying Victoria&#x27;s pale face. The woman who had always seemed invincible now looked small against the white hospital sheets. The tubes and wires connected to her body only emphasized her fragility.<br/><br/>&quot;You need to eat something,&quot; Alexander said softly from the doorway. He carried a paper bag that smelled of soup and bread.<br/><br/>Camille shook her head without looking up. &quot;I&#x27;m not hungry.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander moved to her side, placing a gentle hand on her shoulder. &quot;You haven&#x27;t left this room in thirty-six hours. You need food. Rest.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I can&#x27;t leave her,&quot; Camille whispered, her voice catching. &quot;What if she wakes up and I&#x27;m not here? What if she...&quot;<br/><br/>She couldn&#x27;t finish the sentence. Couldn&#x27;t speak the fear that had haunted her for three days.<br/><br/>Alexander pulled a chair beside her and sat down. &quot;The doctors are doing everything they can.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Is it enough?&quot; Camille asked, her eyes never leaving Victoria&#x27;s face. &quot;The last update wasn&#x27;t promising.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander didn&#x27;t argue. There was no point pretending things weren&#x27;t serious.<br/><br/>Camille looked down at Victoria&#x27;s hand in hers, the skin thin, blue veins visible beneath the surface. This hand had pulled her from darkness. Had shown her how to rebuild her life. Had taught her strength when she believed herself broken beyond repair.<br/><br/>&quot;I can&#x27;t lose her,&quot; Camille said, her voice barely audible. &quot;Not like this. Not because of Rose.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This isn&#x27;t your fault,&quot; Alexander said firmly.<br/><br/>&quot;Isn&#x27;t it? Rose targeted the gala because of me. She planted those bombs to destroy what I had built.&quot; Camille&#x27;s free hand curled into a fist. &quot;If Victoria dies because of that...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;She would tell you not to think that way.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille knew he was right. Victoria would never allow such self-pity. Would never permit Camille to shoulder blame that wasn&#x27;t hers. But knowing that didn&#x27;t ease the crushing weight in her chest.<br/><br/>The monitors beeped, slightly faster than before. Victoria&#x27;s eyelids fluttered but didn&#x27;t open.<br/><br/>&quot;Should I call the nurse?&quot; Alexander asked, already half-rising from his chair.<br/><br/>Camille shook her head. &quot;It happens sometimes. They said it&#x27;s normal.&quot;<br/><br/>Normal. What a strange word to describe any of this. Nothing had been normal since the night of the gala. The bombing had made national news. The Phoenix Foundation&#x27;s triumphant launch had become a story of terrorism and tragedy. And Victoria, who had been slowly losing her battle with cancer, now faced a new fight because of the smoke damage to her lungs.<br/><br/>A light knock on the door interrupted Camille&#x27;s thoughts. Dr. Patel entered, followed by another doctor Camille hadn&#x27;t seen before.<br/><br/>&quot;Ms. Kane,&quot; Dr. Patel said, addressing Camille. &quot;This is Dr. Sharma, our oncology specialist. She&#x27;s been reviewing Victoria&#x27;s latest test results.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille tensed, preparing for bad news. Alexander&#x27;s hand found her shoulder, steadying her.<br/><br/>Dr. Sharma stepped forward, her expression thoughtful rather than grim. &quot;We&#x27;ve detected something unexpected in the latest scans.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What is it?&quot; Camille asked, her throat tight with fear.<br/><br/>&quot;The cancer appears more contained than we initially believed,&quot; Dr. Sharma explained. &quot;Previous scans suggested spread to multiple organs, but our more detailed imaging shows the disease is primarily still concentrated in the pancreas, with only minor involvement of surrounding tissues.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille stared at her, trying to process what this meant. &quot;So... it&#x27;s not as bad as you thought?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The cancer is still serious,&quot; Dr. Sharma cautioned. &quot;But this new finding changes our approach. With aggressive treatment, a combination of targeted radiation therapy and new immunotherapy protocols, we could potentially extend Ms. Kane&#x27;s life expectancy significantly.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;How significantly?&quot; Alexander asked.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s difficult to say with certainty,&quot; Dr. Sharma replied. &quot;But in cases similar to Ms. Kane&#x27;s, we&#x27;ve seen patients survive for years rather than months. The smoke inhalation complications are our immediate concern, but once those are managed, we could begin the new treatment protocol.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille felt dizzy with hope, a feeling so unexpected she hardly recognized it. &quot;Years? She could have years?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;With appropriate treatment and careful management, yes. It&#x27;s possible.&quot;<br/><br/>The doctors continued explaining the treatment plan, but Camille barely heard them. Years. Not months. Not weeks. Years. Time for conversations. For memories. For goodbyes that weren&#x27;t rushed by the ticking clock of terminal illness.<br/><br/>When the doctors left, promising to return with more details after Victoria woke, Camille turned to Alexander, tears filling her eyes.</div>
