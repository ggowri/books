        <h1>Chapter 104-2</h1>
        <div><br/>*** **<br/>Back at the Kane Industries lab, Hannah&#x27;s team worked in focused silence. On the main screen, a digital countdown displayed the days until the Phoenix Grid was scheduled to go fully operational: 5 days, 7 hours, 42 minutes.<br/><br/>Hannah moved between workstations, checking progress, making adjustments. Despite her exhaustion, her mind remained sharp. This was the most challenging engineering problem she&#x27;d ever faced, not just correcting the technical sabotage, but doing it in secret, maintaining the illusion that everything was proceeding normally.<br/><br/>&quot;Ms. Zhao?&quot; One of the younger engineers called her over, pointing to a circuit diagram. &quot;I think I found another one. It&#x27;s subtle, but the power regulator has been modified to allow a ten percent tolerance instead of the standard five percent.&quot;<br/><br/>Hannah examined the component. &quot;Good catch, Davis. Flag it for replacement and add it to the shadow correction log.&quot;<br/><br/>As she straightened, a wave of dizziness swept over her. Hannah gripped the edge of the table, waiting for it to pass. When was the last time she&#x27;d eaten? Slept? The days had begun to blur together.<br/><br/>A hand touched her shoulder gently. She turned to find Camille watching her with concern.<br/><br/>&quot;You need rest,&quot; Camille said quietly. &quot;All of you do.&quot;<br/><br/>Hannah shook her head. &quot;We can&#x27;t stop now. Every hour counts.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I know.&quot; Camille&#x27;s voice was firm but kind. &quot;But I need your team functioning at their best. Four hours of sleep will make you more effective than twelve more hours of exhausted work.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;But...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s an order, Ms. Zhao.&quot; Camille&#x27;s tone softened. &quot;The cots are set up in the conference room. Use them. Four hours. Then back to work.&quot;<br/><br/>Hannah wanted to argue, but the logic was sound. They couldn&#x27;t afford mistakes. And mistakes were inevitable with this level of fatigue.<br/><br/>&quot;Yes, Ms. Kane. Four hours.&quot; She turned to the team. &quot;Everyone, mandatory rest. Davis, set the alarm for six a.m.&quot;<br/><br/>As the engineers filed out, Hannah found herself alone with Camille, who was studying the master diagram with its many red marks.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;ll make it,&quot; Hannah said, trying to sound more confident than she felt. &quot;We&#x27;ll catch everything they sabotaged.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded, but her expression remained troubled. &quot;I believe you will. But I can&#x27;t help wondering...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What if this is exactly what they want?&quot; Camille gestured to the busy workroom. &quot;What if the sabotage we&#x27;ve discovered is just a distraction from something else they&#x27;re planning?&quot;<br/><br/>The question sent a chill through Hannah&#x27;s already tired body. She hadn&#x27;t considered that possibility.<br/><br/>&quot;Like what?&quot; she asked.<br/><br/>&quot;I don&#x27;t know.&quot; Camille&#x27;s eyes focused on something distant. &quot;But Rose has always been ten steps ahead. Always planning for contingencies. And her partner, Herod Preston.... Victoria says he&#x27;s patient. Calculating.&quot;<br/><br/>Hannah thought about the complexity of the sabotage they&#x27;d uncovered. The meticulous way safety systems had been compromised. The careful organization required to implement so many changes without detection.<br/><br/>&quot;You think this might not be their real plan?&quot; she asked, her throat suddenly dry.<br/><br/>&quot;I think we can&#x27;t afford to assume we&#x27;ve discovered everything.&quot; Camille turned to her, eyes hard with resolve. &quot;Fix what we&#x27;ve found, Hannah. But keep looking deeper. And be prepared for something we haven&#x27;t anticipated.&quot;<br/><br/>Hannah nodded, a new worry joining her exhaustion. &quot;I understand.&quot;<br/><br/>As Camille left, Hannah remained standing before the master diagram, staring at the red marks that signified discovered sabotage. But now, instead of progress, the marks seemed to taunt her. What weren&#x27;t they seeing? What hidden threat still lurked in the system they&#x27;d designed with such care?<br/><br/>She forced herself to turn away. Four hours of rest. Then back to the search.<br/><br/>But as she made her way to the conference room, Hannah couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that something still eluded them. Something deadly hiding in plain sight.<br/><br/>** **<br/><br/>In a penthouse across the city, Rose checked her phone as it chimed with an incoming message. The screen displayed a simple text from a now-familiar number: &quot;Component J-14 installed. All proceeding as planned.&quot;<br/><br/>She smiled, setting the phone down on the nightstand. Beside her, Herod slept peacefully, his face relaxed in a way it never was when he was awake.<br/><br/>Everything was falling into place. In just over five days, the Phoenix Grid would go online. Seventy-two hours after that, Camille&#x27;s precious project would implode spectacularly. And in the aftermath, Kane Industries would crumble.<br/><br/>Rose reached over and switched off the lamp, darkness enveloping the room. As she settled back against the pillows, she allowed herself to imagine Camille&#x27;s face when her world collapsed around her. The same expression Rose had worn when Camille returned from the dead as Victoria Kane&#x27;s heir. When she&#x27;d systematically destroyed everything Rose had built.<br/><br/>Soon, very soon, the scales would balance. Justice would be served.<br/><br/>And neither Camille nor Victoria would see it coming.<br/></div>
