        <h1>Chapter 161-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 161<br/><br/>Four weeks. Twenty-eight days without a sign of Rose. Not a text. Not a sighting. Not a whisper.<br/><br/>Camille stood at the window of her office at Kane Industries, watching the city below. Security guards still accompanied her everywhere. The FBI still checked in daily. Alexander&#x27;s team still swept for bugs and bombs each morning.<br/><br/>But something had changed. The tight knot of fear in her stomach had loosened slightly. Not gone, she doubted it would ever truly disappear, but different now. More like an old injury that ached before rain than the sharp, consuming pain of a fresh wound.<br/><br/>She checked her watch. Three hours until they would drive to Victoria&#x27;s lake house. The doctors had finally allowed Victoria to leave the hospital two weeks ago, but insisted she recover somewhere quiet, away from the stress of the city. The lake house, with its private security and peaceful surroundings, had been the perfect solution.<br/><br/>A knock on her door interrupted her thoughts. Jason, Alexander&#x27;s head of security, entered with his daily report.<br/><br/>&quot;All clear, Ms. Kane,&quot; he said. &quot;The route to the lake house has been secured. We&#x27;ll have teams stationed at every checkpoint along the way.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Thank you, Jason,&quot; Camille replied. &quot;Any updates from the FBI?&quot;<br/><br/>He shook his head. &quot;Nothing new. They&#x27;ve followed leads in five states, but nothing concrete. Agent Chen believes Ms. Lewis may have left the country.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded, unsurprised. The FBI had been saying similar things for weeks now. Rose had vanished, like smoke dissipating into air.<br/><br/>Part of Camille wanted to believe it—that Rose had run, given up, moved on. But the part that knew her sister best remained on guard. Rose never gave up. Never abandoned her plans. Never left a score unsettled.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;ll maintain all security protocols,&quot; Jason continued, reading her thoughts. &quot;Mr. Pierce has been very clear about that.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Of course,&quot; Camille agreed. &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br/><br/>After Jason left, Camille returned to her work. The Phoenix Foundation rebuilding efforts were moving ahead steadily. New offices had been secured. Staff rehired. Projects restarted. It felt good to create again, to build rather than merely survive.<br/><br/>The afternoon passed quickly. When Alexander arrived to pick her up, Camille was surprised to see him dressed casually—jeans and a light sweater instead of his usual suit.<br/><br/>&quot;You look different,&quot; she said, smiling despite herself.<br/><br/>&quot;Victoria&#x27;s orders,&quot; he replied. &quot;No business attire at the lake house. Apparently we both need to &#x27;remember how to relax&#x27; before we &#x27;turn into workaholics like her.&#x27;&quot;<br/><br/>Camille laughed, the sound still unfamiliar to her ears after weeks of tension. &quot;Did she actually say that?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Word for word. Complete with dire threats if we disobey.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille gathered her things, including a small overnight bag. Victoria had insisted they stay the night, watch the sunrise over the lake, pretend for a few hours that their lives weren&#x27;t forever altered by Rose&#x27;s vendetta.<br/><br/>The drive north took nearly two hours. Security vehicles preceded and followed their car, a precaution that had become so routine Camille hardly noticed anymore. The city gave way to suburbs, then to rolling countryside, until finally they turned onto the private road leading to Victoria&#x27;s lake house.<br/><br/>Nestled among pine trees, the house wasn&#x27;t as grand as Camille had expected. Victoria Kane, known for her luxury penthouses and corner offices, had chosen something almost modest for her retreat. The two-story structure of wood and glass faced a small private lake, its deck extending out over the water.<br/><br/>Security personnel were visible but discreet—a team at the gate, another patrolling the perimeter, yet another stationed near the dock. Alexander had insisted on the highest level of protection despite the remote location.<br/><br/>Victoria waited for them on the deck, seated in a comfortable chair with a blanket across her lap despite the warm evening. She was thinner than before her illness, her cheekbones more prominent, but her eyes were clear and alert. More importantly, she was smiling, something Camille had seen too rarely in recent months.<br/><br/>&quot;Finally,&quot; Victoria called as they approached. &quot;I was beginning to think you&#x27;d gotten lost.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille climbed the steps to the deck and bent to kiss Victoria&#x27;s cheek. &quot;Traffic was heavy leaving the city.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Excuses,&quot; Victoria dismissed with a wave of her hand. &quot;Come, sit. Dinner will be ready soon.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander joined them, taking a seat across from Victoria. &quot;The security teams reported all clear?&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria shot him a look. &quot;We agreed, no business talk tonight. That includes security reports.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander raised his hands in surrender. &quot;Sorry. Old habits.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Break them,&quot; Victoria instructed firmly. &quot;For one night, we&#x27;re going to pretend we&#x27;re normal people enjoying a quiet evening at the lake. Is that understood?&quot;<br/><br/>Camille exchanged a glance with Alexander, a smile tugging at her lips. This was the Victoria she remembered, commanding, brooking no opposition, determined to bend the world to her will. Cancer had weakened her body but not her spirit.<br/><br/>&quot;Understood,&quot; Camille agreed, settling into a chair beside Victoria. &quot;No business talk.&quot;<br/><br/>The evening air was cool but pleasant. The lake stretched before them, its surface glassy in the fading light. Birds called from the surrounding trees. From somewhere inside the house came the sound of dinner being prepared.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s beautiful here,&quot; Camille said, breathing deeply. &quot;I can see why you love it.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria nodded. &quot;I bought this place thirty years ago, after my first major business success. Everyone expected me to purchase something ostentatious, a mansion, a penthouse. Instead, I found this.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It suits you,&quot; Alexander observed. &quot;Understated but impressive.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria almost smiled at that. &quot;The water helps me think. Always has.&quot;<br/><br/>They sat in comfortable silence as the sun dipped lower, painting the lake in shades of gold and orange. Camille felt something inside her slowly unwinding, a tension so constant she&#x27;d forgotten what it felt like to be without it.</div>
