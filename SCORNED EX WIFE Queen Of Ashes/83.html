        <h1>Chapter 63-1</h1>
        <div> Chapter 63<br/><br/>Camille&#x27;s point of view<br/><br/>The morning sun filled my home office, bathing the pristine white furniture in golden light that should have been soothing. Instead, I stared at my tablet screen, my chest so tight I could barely breathe. The headline of the Wall Street Journal&#x27;s business section screamed at me in bold black letters:<br/><br/>**LEWIS INDUSTRIES TO RESCUE RODRIGUEZ SHIPPING WITH $100M INVESTMENT**<br/><br/>The subheading twisted the knife deeper:<br/><br/>**Wedding Bells to Follow: Rodriguez-Lewis Union Cements Business Partnership**<br/><br/>My coffee cup crashed to the floor as I stood abruptly, hot liquid splattering across imported marble tiles. I didn&#x27;t care. The words on the screen burned through my mind, erasing months of careful planning, of systematic destruction, of what should have been complete victory.<br/><br/>&quot;No,&quot; I whispered, my voice trembling with emotion I rarely allowed myself anymore. &quot;No, no, NO!&quot;<br/><br/>I scrolled through the article, each paragraph feeding the fire growing inside me:<br/><br/>*In a surprising turn of events, Lewis Industries has announced a $100 million investment in Rodriguez Shipping&#x27;s Seattle operations, rescuing the century-old family business from complete collapse following Kane Industries&#x27; recent debt acquisition.*<br/><br/>*Sources close to both families confirm that the business alliance will be strengthened by personal ties, with an October wedding planned between Stefan Rodriguez and Rose Lewis, sister of the late Camille Lewis-Rodriguez.*<br/><br/>*&quot;This partnership represents not just a business opportunity, but the joining of two family legacies,&quot; Richard Lewis stated in this morning&#x27;s press conference. &quot;Sometimes tragedy can lead to unexpected new beginnings.&quot;*<br/><br/>The tablet flew from my hands before I realized I&#x27;d thrown it, shattering against the far wall in a spray of glass and electronics. The destruction wasn&#x27;t enough. Nothing could quiet the storm raging inside me.<br/><br/>After everything I&#x27;d done. After buying his company&#x27;s debt. After taking his family home. After systematically destroying everything the Rodriguez name stood for.<br/><br/>Stefan was still choosing Rose. Still moving forward with the life they&#x27;d planned while I was supposedly dead at the bottom of that river.<br/><br/>And my parents - MY PARENTS - were funding it all.<br/><br/>My intercom buzzed, Rebecca&#x27;s voice careful and measured: &quot;Ms. Kane? I assume you&#x27;ve seen the news. Victoria is on the secure line.&quot;<br/><br/>I forced myself to take three deep breaths before responding. &quot;Send the call through.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s face appeared on my wall screen, her expression controlled but fury evident in the tightness around her eyes. She was in her Tokyo hotel suite, the skyline visible behind her through floor-to-ceiling windows. <br/><br/>&quot;This is unacceptable,&quot; she said without greeting. &quot;All our careful work, undone by a simple investment deal.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;They can&#x27;t do this,&quot; I replied, pacing the length of my office. &quot;We own the debt. We control the assets. How can Lewis Industries possibly...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;They&#x27;re not buying the company,&quot; Victoria interrupted. &quot;They&#x27;re creating a new entity, using the few assets we couldn&#x27;t touch, primarily the Seattle operations we thought were too worthless to bother with. Your father has found a legal workaround that keeps the Rodriguez name alive, if significantly diminished.&quot;<br/><br/>The word &quot;father&quot; sent fresh pain shooting through me. Richard Lewis was funding the revival of Stefan&#x27;s business, cementing Rose&#x27;s triumph, all while having no idea he was destroying his supposedly dead daughter&#x27;s carefully executed revenge.<br/><br/>&quot;The wedding announcement wasn&#x27;t coincidental,&quot; Victoria continued, her analytical mind already dissecting the strategy. &quot;It&#x27;s a deliberate message to investors and clients, a statement of confidence in the new venture. The Rodriguez-Lewis union creates stability, continuity, tradition.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I want it stopped.&quot; My voice came out harder than I&#x27;d ever heard it. &quot;All of it. The investment. The business alliance. The wedding. I want it all burned to the ground.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria studied me through the screen, her gaze softening slightly, a rare glimpse of the maternal concern she typically kept hidden beneath her formidable exterior. &quot;This is why I&#x27;ve always cautioned against emotional involvement in business matters. You&#x27;re taking this personally.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Of course I&#x27;m taking it personally!&quot; I slammed my hand against my desk, welcoming the physical pain. &quot;It IS personal. It&#x27;s MY revenge they&#x27;re unraveling. MY justice being denied.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Your revenge isn&#x27;t complete,&quot; Victoria said calmly. &quot;This is merely an unexpected development requiring tactical adjustment.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Tactical adjustment?&quot; I laughed, the sound sharp and bitter even to my own ears. &quot;They&#x27;re getting MARRIED, Victoria. With my parents&#x27; blessing and financial support. After everything they did to me. After everything we&#x27;ve done to destroy them.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And they will still pay. Perhaps more completely than before.&quot; Victoria leaned closer to the camera, her expression intensifying. &quot;This development presents new opportunities. They&#x27;re rebuilding, investing emotions and resources into a future they believe is secure. When we destroy that future, the pain will be magnified considerably.&quot;<br/><br/>Her logic should have calmed me. Should have helped me see past the raw hurt to the strategic implications. Instead, I felt something crack inside, some final piece of the woman I&#x27;d once been breaking away.<br/><br/>&quot;I feel like everything we&#x27;ve done was for nothing,&quot; I said, collapsing back into my chair. &quot;They still win in the end.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s expression shifted, calculation replacing concern. &quot;Perhaps we&#x27;ve been too... indirect in our approach.&quot; A small, dangerous smile curved her lips. &quot;We need to create a scandal that will completely destroy your sister Rose.&quot;</div>
