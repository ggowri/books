        <h1>Chapter 65-2</h1>
        <div><br/>The knocking on her door grew louder. Rose ended the call, moving to the entry and peering through the peephole. Her assistant, Michael, stood there looking terrified.<br/><br/>&quot;Ms. Lewis, please, I need to speak with you.&quot; His voice carried through the door, high with anxiety. &quot;Vogue just pulled your feature completely. Neiman Marcus is invoking the morality clause in their contract. Your main fabric supplier in Italy just canceled all pending orders.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose yanked the door open, pulling Michael inside before slamming it shut again. &quot;Tell me something I don&#x27;t know!&quot;<br/><br/>He flinched at her tone but continued. &quot;Your investors are calling an emergency meeting this afternoon. The bank froze your business accounts pending review of the money laundering allegations.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;They can&#x27;t do that!&quot; Rose grabbed his arm, fingers digging in hard enough to make him wince. &quot;That&#x27;s my money! My business!&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The freeze is temporary, but... with the production timeline for your fall collection...&quot; Michael trailed off, not needing to finish the thought. Without access to funds, without fabric suppliers, without retail partners, the collection was effectively dead.<br/><br/>Rose released him, moving back to the window where the crowd of reporters had grown. Someone must have tipped them off that she was home. The thought sent fresh rage coursing through her.<br/><br/>&quot;Who did this?&quot; she whispered, more to herself than Michael. &quot;Who has enough power to coordinate something this comprehensive?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I don&#x27;t know, but there&#x27;s something else.&quot; Michael held out his tablet, displaying another news site. &quot;They&#x27;re reporting that an anonymous source provided evidence that some of your early designs weren&#x27;t original. That you... appropriated them from other designers who never received credit.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose snatched the tablet, scanning the article with growing horror. There, displayed side by side, were sketches from her most celebrated collections alongside nearly identical drawings from other designers&#x27; portfolios, designers who had worked with her, mentored her, trusted her with their creative process.<br/><br/>&quot;These are lies,&quot; she hissed, throwing the tablet onto the sofa. &quot;Distortions. Similar designs happen in fashion all the time. It&#x27;s called inspiration!&quot;<br/><br/>Michael looked unconvinced but knew better than to contradict her directly. &quot;What do you want me to do? The press is demanding a statement.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose paced the length of her penthouse, mind racing through options, through damage control scenarios, through ways to salvage what remained of her reputation and business. Someone had orchestrated this takedown with surgical precision, timing each revelation for maximum impact.<br/><br/>&quot;Find me a list of enemies,&quot; she said suddenly, turning to face her assistant. &quot;Everyone I&#x27;ve crossed in the industry. Everyone who might have resources to do this. Everyone who might want to destroy me.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That... might be a long list,&quot; Michael said carefully.<br/><br/>Rose moved to her dressing room, scanning her clothing options with frantic energy. If she had to face this storm, she would at least look impeccable doing it.<br/><br/>&quot;Tell him to focus on the coordinated nature of the attacks. Make it clear this is a deliberate takedown by unnamed competitors threatened by my success. Deny any financial impropriety completely. For the affairs, say my private life is my business and has no bearing on my professional contributions.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And the design theft allegations?&quot;<br/><br/>Rose yanked a crimson dress from its hanger, the color perfect for projecting confidence and defiance. &quot;Similar aesthetic sensibilities are common in creative industries. I was influenced by many designers, as they were by me. I categorically deny stealing anyone&#x27;s work.&quot;<br/><br/>As she dressed, applied fresh makeup, and prepared to face the media circus outside her building, Rose&#x27;s mind continued turning over possibilities. Who had the reach to find people from her London and Paris days? Who had the connections to access banking records from a decade ago? Who had the patience to compile this evidence slowly, methodically, waiting for the perfect moment to destroy her?<br/><br/>The answer remained elusive, but the question burned with obsessive intensity. Someone had declared war on Rose Lewis. Someone with resources and motivation she couldn&#x27;t identify. Someone who knew exactly where to find her weakest points, her buried secrets, her carefully hidden past.<br/><br/>&quot;Your car is waiting at the service entrance,&quot; Michael reported, ending a call with building security. &quot;They&#x27;ve cleared a path, but there are still reporters. Do you want to make a statement or go straight to your lawyer&#x27;s office?&quot;<br/><br/>Rose checked her reflection one final time, smoothing her hair and straightening her shoulders. The woman in the mirror looked nothing like the panicked, raging figure who had been throwing objects minutes earlier. She looked composed, confident, defiant.<br/><br/>It was the greatest performance of her career.<br/><br/>&quot;No statement yet,&quot; she decided. &quot;Let them speculate. Let them wonder. I won&#x27;t give them the satisfaction of seeing me break.&quot;<br/><br/>As she gathered her purse and phone, another alert appeared on Michael&#x27;s tablet. He tried to shield the screen, but Rose caught the headline: &quot;EXCLUSIVE: Rose Lewis&#x27;s Former Mentor Reveals Pattern of Deception, Manipulation.&quot;<br/><br/>Her mentor. Eliza Winterbourne. The woman who had taught her not just design but strategy. The woman who had trusted her completely. The woman whose private collection of vintage couture Rose had carefully photographed and replicated without permission.<br/><br/>&quot;I want a full report on who&#x27;s talking by this afternoon,&quot; Rose instructed Michael, her voice glacial with suppressed fury. &quot;Every name. Every allegation. Every connection between them. Someone orchestrated this, and I will find out who.&quot;<br/><br/>In the elevator descending to the service level, Rose caught her reflection in the polished metal doors. The perfect image of success she&#x27;d cultivated so carefully, showing nothing of the ruins beneath.<br/><br/>As the doors opened and she prepared to face the waiting cameras, a single question burned through the shock and rage: who had the power and motivation to destroy her so completely? Who had compiled evidence buried for years, coordinated revelations from people across continents, timed everything for maximum damage?<br/><br/>The answer waited somewhere beyond the flashbulbs and shouted questions. And Rose Lewis would find it, even if she had to burn what remained of her world to the ground in the process.<br/></div>
