        <h1>Chapter 65-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 65<br/><br/>The breakfast tray sat untouched on Rose&#x27;s nightstand, fresh fruit and pastries growing stale in the morning air. She hadn&#x27;t moved from the edge of her bed for nearly an hour, eyes fixed on the television screen where her life was unraveling in high definition.<br/><br/>&quot;Fashion designer Rose Lewis faces new allegations today,&quot; the entertainment reporter said, her expression a mask of professional concern that barely concealed her delight in the scandal. &quot;Former associates have come forward with evidence that Lewis engaged in multiple affairs during her European apprenticeship, including relationships with married industry leaders who later promoted her work.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s fingers dug into her silk comforter until her knuckles turned white. This wasn&#x27;t happening. Not now. Not when everything was finally coming together.<br/><br/>The reporter continued, her voice dripping with false sympathy. &quot;Most damaging are claims from British fashion executive Jonathan Hayes, who alleges Lewis used their affair to gain industry access while simultaneously pursuing a relationship with his business partner.&quot;<br/><br/>The screen filled with Jonathan&#x27;s face, older now, silver threading through the dark hair she remembered running her fingers through in London hotel rooms. His expression held no remorse as he detailed their relationship to the waiting cameras.<br/><br/>&quot;She was calculating even then,&quot; he said, eyes meeting the camera directly. &quot;Everything was transactional. An affair for introductions. Intimacy for opportunities.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose grabbed the remote, hurling it at the screen with a scream of frustration. It bounced harmlessly off the glass, the reporter&#x27;s voice continuing uninterrupted.<br/><br/>&quot;These allegations come at a particularly sensitive time for Lewis, whose fashion line has been struggling with production delays and canceled orders from major retailers.&quot;<br/><br/>The doorbell rang, its cheerful chime a jarring contrast to the destruction playing out on the screen. Rose ignored it, pulling her knees to her chest as more evidence of her past appeared in professionally edited segments.<br/><br/>Lord Hartley, silver-haired and aristocratic, seated in his country estate library: &quot;She made me believe I was special, that our connection was unique. Later I discovered she was seeing my colleague simultaneously, leveraging both relationships for fashion world introductions.&quot;<br/><br/>The former assistant to Anton Bessonov, her eyes hard with old resentment: &quot;She lived on his yacht while his wife believed she was attending design conferences. When international authorities began investigating Mr. Bessonov&#x27;s finances, she disappeared overnight.&quot;<br/><br/>Photos flashed across the screen, Rose entering hotels with different men, Rose boarding the infamous yacht in Monaco, Rose at industry events on the arm of designers three times her age. Each image more damning than the last, each time-stamped to create a comprehensive timeline of calculated ambition.<br/><br/>The doorbell rang again, more insistent this time. Rose buried her face in her hands, tears streaming between her fingers. How had they found these people? Who had convinced them to speak after all these years? She&#x27;d been so careful, had paid for silence when necessary, had created a narrative of dedicated apprenticeship that everyone had accepted without question.<br/><br/>Until now.<br/><br/>Her phone buzzed with messages from her publicist, her lawyer, her business manager, all demanding to speak with her, all wanting direction on how to handle the crisis. Rose ignored them all, her eyes returning to the television where her carefully constructed life continued to disintegrate.<br/><br/>&quot;Former classmates from Lewis&#x27;s fashion program have also come forward,&quot; the reporter was saying, clearly enjoying each new revelation. &quot;They allege systematic theft of design concepts that later appeared in Lewis&#x27;s breakthrough collection.&quot;<br/><br/>A photo appeared, Rose&#x27;s award-winning graduation piece juxtaposed with a nearly identical sketch from a classmate&#x27;s portfolio, dated months earlier. Side by side, the theft was unmistakable, the minor alterations insufficient to hide the original source.<br/><br/>&quot;No, no, NO!&quot; Rose screamed, grabbing a crystal vase from her nightstand and hurling it against the wall. The glass shattered, water and flowers spraying across imported wallpaper. The destruction wasn&#x27;t enough to ease the panic rising in her chest.<br/><br/>The reporter was now discussing financial connections between Rose and Anton Bessonov, suggesting that her early design collections had been funded through questionable sources.<br/><br/>&quot;Banking records obtained exclusively by our investigative team show substantial deposits to Lewis&#x27;s accounts during her time with Bessonov,&quot; the woman explained as graphics appeared on screen. &quot;These deposits moved through several shell companies before reaching her, a pattern financial experts describe as consistent with money laundering techniques.&quot;<br/><br/>The doorbell rang a third time, followed by heavy knocking. Rose pulled herself from the bed on unsteady legs, moving to the window to peer through the blinds. Reporters. At least a dozen of them crowded her building&#x27;s entrance, cameras ready, faces eager for a glimpse of the fallen fashion darling.<br/><br/>Her phone rang again, her publicist for the fifth time. Rose finally answered, her voice tight with barely controlled fury.<br/><br/>&quot;What the hell is happening, Melissa? How did they get all this? Who&#x27;s behind it?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I don&#x27;t know,&quot; her publicist replied, professional calm cracking under pressure. &quot;It&#x27;s coordinated, that&#x27;s all I can tell you. Multiple outlets receiving the same evidence simultaneously. Former associates contacted by someone offering significant money for exclusive interviews. It&#x27;s... it&#x27;s unprecedented.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Make it stop!&quot; Rose demanded, pacing her bedroom like a caged animal. &quot;That&#x27;s what I pay you for!&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s too late for containment. We need to issue a statement immediately. Something addressing the allegations directly while....&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No! Absolutely not!&quot; Rose cut her off. &quot;We deny everything. Every single thing. Call it a smear campaign by jealous competitors.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Rose, there are photos. Time-stamped, authenticated photos. There are bank records. There are multiple credible witnesses all telling consistent stories. Denial will make this worse.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose swept her arm across her vanity, sending perfume bottles and makeup crashing to the floor. &quot;I don&#x27;t care! Find out who&#x27;s behind this. Someone orchestrated it. Someone with resources and connections. I want to know who!&quot;</div>
