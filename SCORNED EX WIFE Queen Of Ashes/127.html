        <h1>Chapter 89-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 89<br/><br/>Alexander Pierce&#x27;s car slid to a stop outside the modest apartment building in Brooklyn. He checked the address on his phone again, confirming this was indeed where Stefan Rodriguez now lived. The fall from grace had been steep, from a penthouse overlooking Central Park to this brick walkup with peeling paint.<br/><br/>&quot;Wait here,&quot; he told his driver, stepping out into the brisk afternoon air.<br/><br/>The security buzzer was broken. Alexander pushed through the lobby door, grimacing at the smell of old cooking oil and cigarettes that hung in the narrow hallway. Apartment 3B was at the end of the third-floor corridor, its door as shabby as the rest of the building.<br/><br/>Alexander straightened his tie, a habit from childhood when facing difficult situations, and knocked.<br/><br/>Footsteps approached from inside, followed by the click of locks. The door swung open to reveal Stefan Rodriguez, unshaven and bleary-eyed in wrinkled clothes. Recognition dawned slowly on his face, followed by confusion.<br/><br/>&quot;Pierce? What the hell are you doing here?&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander kept his face neutral. &quot;We need to talk.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan laughed, the sound hollow and bitter. &quot;About what? How your girlfriend destroyed my family&#x27;s company? Or maybe you want the recipe for rock bottom. I&#x27;ve perfected it lately.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;About Camille,&quot; Alexander said simply. &quot;She needs your help.&quot;<br/><br/>Something flickered across Stefan&#x27;s face, surprise, guilt, curiosity. He stepped back, gesturing Alexander inside with a mocking bow.<br/><br/>&quot;Welcome to my humble new reality. Excuse the mess. Maid service was one of the first luxuries to go.&quot;<br/><br/>The apartment was small but surprisingly clean, despite Stefan&#x27;s appearance. A laptop sat open on a folding table surrounded by job applications and financial documents. Empty takeout containers clustered near an overflowing trash can. A mattress on the floor served as both bed and couch.<br/><br/>&quot;Drink?&quot; Stefan asked, retrieving a half-empty whiskey bottle from the kitchenette. &quot;It&#x27;s not the thirty-year-old Macallan you&#x27;re probably used to, but it does the job.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No, thank you.&quot; Alexander remained standing, studying the man before him.<br/><br/>&quot;Suit yourself.&quot; Stefan poured a generous measure into a water glass. &quot;So what could the mighty Alexander Pierce possibly want from me? Last time I checked, I was fresh out of shipping companies for you to acquire.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander cut through the bitterness. &quot;Have you seen the news about Camille?&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan&#x27;s expression changed, defenses dropping momentarily. &quot;About her supposed mental issues? Yeah. Hard to miss when your ex-wife is being torn apart on every channel.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s all lies,&quot; Alexander said flatly. &quot;Fabricated by Rose and someone with significant resources.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And this concerns me how, exactly?&quot; Stefan took a long drink, but his eyes betrayed interest despite his detached tone.<br/><br/>Alexander stepped closer. &quot;Because you&#x27;re the only person who can convincingly refute Rose&#x27;s story.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan snorted. &quot;Me? The ex-husband who cheated on her with her sister? That&#x27;s your character witness?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes,&quot; Alexander said firmly. &quot;You lived with Camille for years. You know she never had these supposed psychiatric problems. You know Rose is lying.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan set down his glass, studying Alexander with new focus. &quot;Why would I help her? Camille made her feelings for me perfectly clear. She wants nothing to do with me.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This isn&#x27;t about what Camille wants from you,&quot; Alexander replied. &quot;It&#x27;s about doing the right thing. For once.&quot;<br/><br/>The words hung in the air between them. Stefan turned away, moving to the apartment&#x27;s single window. He stared out at the brick wall of the neighboring building.<br/><br/>&quot;You know what&#x27;s strange?&quot; he said finally. &quot;Watching someone you hurt succeed without you. Seeing them build something new from the ruins you left them in.&quot; He glanced back at Alexander. &quot;Camille with Kane Industries. The Phoenix Grid. Her new life with you.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This isn&#x27;t about me,&quot; Alexander started.<br/><br/>&quot;Isn&#x27;t it?&quot; Stefan turned fully now, something sharp in his gaze. &quot;The great Alexander Pierce, rushing to save Camille. Tell me, are you doing this because it&#x27;s &#x27;right&#x27; or because you&#x27;re in love with her?&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander felt heat rise in his neck, caught off guard by the direct question. &quot;My personal feelings aren&#x27;t relevant to...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;They&#x27;re completely relevant,&quot; Stefan interrupted. &quot;Because if this is just business, protecting Kane Industries and your investment in the Phoenix Grid, then I&#x27;ve got nothing for you. But if you actually care about her...&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s carefully maintained composure cracked. &quot;Of course I care about her. I&#x27;ve watched her rebuild herself from nothing. Seen her fight through pain that would destroy most people.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s not what I asked.&quot; Stefan&#x27;s eyes never left Alexander&#x27;s face. &quot;Are you in love with her?&quot;<br/><br/>The question stripped away pretense. Alexander thought of Camille&#x27;s face the first time she&#x27;d truly smiled at him, not as Camille Kane but as herself. How something had shifted inside him, recognizing the strength beneath her carefully constructed facade.<br/><br/>&quot;Yes,&quot; he admitted, the word escaping before he could stop it. &quot;Yes, I&#x27;m in love with her.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan nodded slowly, as if confirming something he&#x27;d already known. &quot;At least you&#x27;re honest about it. That&#x27;s more than I ever was.&quot;<br/><br/>He moved to the kitchenette, refilling his glass. &quot;You know, when I first saw Camille Kane at that gallery opening, something felt familiar. I couldn&#x27;t place it. Her face was different, but something in her eyes...&quot; He shook his head. &quot;I should have recognized her.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Would it have changed anything if you had?&quot; Alexander asked.<br/><br/>Stefan considered this. &quot;Probably not. I was too far gone by then. Too caught up in Rose&#x27;s web.&quot; He took another drink. &quot;Rose. God, what a fool I was.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You&#x27;re not the first man to be manipulated by her,&quot; Alexander said, though his tone carried little sympathy.<br/><br/>&quot;No, but I&#x27;m the one who threw away someone good for her.&quot; Stefan&#x27;s voice roughened. &quot;You want to know if Camille ever showed signs of mental instability? The answer is no. Not once. She was the sanest, most grounded person I knew. Patient. Kind. Too kind, looking back.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Then say that publicly,&quot; Alexander pressed. &quot;Hold a press conference. Refute Rose&#x27;s claims. Tell the world what Camille was really like.&quot;</div>
