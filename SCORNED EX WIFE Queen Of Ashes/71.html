        <h1>Chapter 56-2</h1>
        <div><br/>The rejection staggered her. Stefan had always been her safety net. Her sure thing. The man who would stand by her no matter what, who had carried a torch for her even through his marriage to Camille.<br/><br/>&quot;You don&#x27;t mean that,&quot; she whispered.<br/><br/>&quot;I wish I didn&#x27;t.&quot; He ran a hand through his disheveled hair. &quot;You know what keeps me awake at night? Not the company collapsing. Not my father&#x27;s disappointment. It&#x27;s thinking about how I treated Camille. How I was cold to her, distant, always comparing her to some idealized version of you I&#x27;d created in my head.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose felt the conversation sliding into dangerous territory. &quot;Camille is gone, Stefan. We&#x27;ve both mourned her. This isn&#x27;t about her.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Isn&#x27;t it?&quot; His eyes locked with hers. &quot;I left a good woman who loved me genuinely for... what? The fantasy of you I&#x27;d been carrying since college? A woman who doesn&#x27;t actually exist?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I exist,&quot; Rose snapped, anger sparking again. &quot;I&#x27;m standing right here, fighting for us while you throw away everything we&#x27;ve built because of some old photos, some business mistakes...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s not about the photos!&quot; Stefan&#x27;s voice rose, startling her into silence. &quot;It&#x27;s about the pattern they reveal. It&#x27;s about realizing that the woman I&#x27;ve spent years pining for is a construction. A carefully calculated image designed to get exactly what you want.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s not true,&quot; she insisted, but the protest sounded hollow even to her own ears.<br/><br/>&quot;Isn&#x27;t it?&quot; Stefan picked up the society pages from the coffee table, where their engagement photo had once been prominently featured. Now replaced by coverage of her scandals and his company&#x27;s financial troubles. &quot;Tell me something real, Rose. One thing that isn&#x27;t part of your master plan. One genuine emotion you&#x27;ve ever felt.&quot;<br/><br/>She opened her mouth, then closed it again. What could she say that he would believe now? What truth could penetrate the wall of suspicion she&#x27;d inadvertently built through years of calculation and control?<br/><br/>&quot;I love you,&quot; she said finally, voice small. &quot;That&#x27;s real.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan studied her face for a long moment. &quot;Maybe you do. In your way. But I don&#x27;t think your version of love looks anything like mine.&quot;<br/><br/>He moved toward the door, picking up the overnight bag he&#x27;d packed earlier. The sight sent panic coursing through Rose&#x27;s veins.<br/><br/>&quot;Where are you going?&quot; she demanded.<br/><br/>&quot;My family&#x27;s estate. Father thinks we need to present a united front during the company crisis.&quot; Stefan&#x27;s voice was flat, emotionless. &quot;But the truth is, I need space to think. About the business. About us. About who I&#x27;ve become trying to hold onto someone who may never have existed at all.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose moved quickly, blocking his path to the door. &quot;You can&#x27;t leave. Not now. Not when both our businesses are under attack. Don&#x27;t you see? Someone is targeting us. The same person who&#x27;s going after your company is destroying my brand. We need to stand together.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Maybe.&quot; Stefan gently moved her aside. &quot;But right now, I&#x27;m not sure I know who I&#x27;d be standing with.&quot;<br/><br/>The words cut deeper than any accusation about her past. For years, Rose had maintained perfect control over how others perceived her. Had crafted an image so flawless, so compelling that even her indiscretions were overlooked, her manipulations excused, her calculated moves mistaken for genuine connection.<br/><br/>Now that carefully constructed façade was crumbling, revealing the emptiness beneath. And for the first time in her adult life, Rose felt real fear.<br/><br/>Not fear of financial ruin, though that loomed ever larger with each canceled order. Not fear of social humiliation, though the society pages now painted her as a pariah rather than a darling.<br/><br/>But fear of losing the one person who had wanted her, or at least, the version of her she&#x27;d presented, consistently for years. The one person whose devotion she&#x27;d counted on as a constant in her calculated rise to power.<br/><br/>&quot;Stefan, please.&quot; She abandoned pride, abandoned calculation, abandoned the careful masks she&#x27;d worn for so long. &quot;I need you.&quot;<br/><br/>He paused at the door, his back to her. For a moment, hope flared in her chest. Then he spoke, voice quiet but firm.<br/><br/>&quot;The problem is, Rose, I don&#x27;t think you need anyone. Not really. Not in any way that matters.&quot;<br/><br/>The door closed behind him with a soft click that somehow hurt more than if he&#x27;d slammed it. Rose stood frozen in the entryway, the sound of rain against windows the only noise in the suddenly empty penthouse.<br/><br/>Her phone buzzed on the coffee table, another news alert, no doubt. Another scandal unearthed. Another piece of her carefully constructed life exposed for all to see.<br/><br/>She moved to the window instead, watching Stefan emerge from the building below, overnight bag in hand. Even from this height, she could see the slump of his shoulders, the defeat in his posture as he climbed into the waiting car.<br/><br/>Something tightened in her chest, an unfamiliar ache she couldn&#x27;t immediately identify. Was this what real pain felt like? Not the calculated shows of emotion she&#x27;d performed throughout her life, but genuine loss?<br/><br/>The irony wasn&#x27;t lost on her. After years of taking what she wanted, of manipulating situations and people to achieve her goals, she might have finally developed genuine feelings for Stefan just in time to lose him.<br/><br/>Lightning flashed again, illuminating her reflection in the glass, designer clothes, perfect makeup, not a hair out of place despite the emotional storm that had just torn through the apartment. The perfect exterior hiding the growing panic beneath.<br/><br/>Her phone buzzed again. This time she picked it up, expecting another media alert about her scandals.<br/><br/>Instead, a new headline made her blood run cold:<br/><br/>&quot;TECH TRILLIONAIRE ALEXANDER PIERCE AND KANE HEIRESS CAMILLE: POWER COUPLE IN THE MAKING?&quot;<br/><br/>Below it, photos from a charity gala showed the notoriously private Alexander Pierce placing a diamond necklace around the neck of Victoria Kane&#x27;s mysterious adopted daughter. The woman looked radiant, genuinely touched by the gesture.<br/><br/>Rose stared at the image, something nagging at the edges of her consciousness. Something about the woman&#x27;s profile, about the way she tilted her head slightly as Pierce leaned close.<br/><br/>Something hauntingly familiar that she couldn&#x27;t quite place.<br/><br/>As she studied the photo, her mind racing to identify the sense of recognition, another alert appeared. Her fashion line&#x27;s main manufacturing partner had just pulled out of their contract, citing &quot;irreparable brand damage&quot; and &quot;ethical concerns.&quot;<br/><br/>The final nail in her professional coffin.<br/><br/>Rose sank onto the sofa, phone still clutched in her hand, the rain lashing the windows matching the storm inside her. Everything she&#x27;d built, everything she&#x27;d schemed for, everything she&#x27;d sacrificed others to achieve, all crumbling around her in a matter of weeks.<br/><br/>And for the first time in her carefully calculated life, Rose Lewis had no contingency plan.<br/></div>
