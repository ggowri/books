        <h1>Chapter 98-2</h1>
        <div><br/>&quot;No.&quot; Herod&#x27;s confidence seemed absolute. &quot;By the time they figure out who I am, it will be far too late.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose moved to the desk where several phones lay in a neat row. &quot;And these are ready?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes. Untraceable. Use a different one for each call. Destroy them afterward.&quot; He picked up one of the phones. &quot;The encrypted messaging app is already installed. Our communications will leave no trace.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose took the phone, their fingers brushing. The contact sent electricity up her arm, a different kind of thrill than thoughts of revenge. For a moment, neither pulled away.<br/><br/>&quot;You&#x27;ve thought of everything,&quot; Rose said softly.<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s why I survived when my family didn&#x27;t. Why I rebuilt while Victoria thought she had destroyed us completely.&quot; Herod&#x27;s voice dropped lower. &quot;Never underestimate the power of patient hatred, Rose. It burns cleaner than any other fuel.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose understood. Hadn&#x27;t she nursed her own hatred for Camille since childhood? Hadn&#x27;t she plotted for years to take everything her sister had?<br/><br/>&quot;So we&#x27;re set,&quot; she said, pocketing the phone. &quot;Nothing left but to watch it unfold.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Almost nothing.&quot; Herod opened a drawer and removed a small box. &quot;One final touch.&quot;<br/><br/>Inside the box lay a silver pin shaped like a phoenix rising from flames, identical to the emblem Camille wore constantly.<br/><br/>&quot;A gift from an anonymous donor to every major news outlet in the city,&quot; Herod explained. &quot;Arriving the morning after the explosions, with a note suggesting they investigate whether Kane Industries knew about safety concerns before the grid went online.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose picked up the pin, turning it in the light. &quot;My sister does love her symbols.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And symbols are powerful. Especially when they&#x27;re turned against you.&quot; Herod closed the box. &quot;The phoenix that rises from these ashes will be us, Rose. Not Camille Kane.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose felt dizzy with anticipation. After months of humiliation, of watching Camille rise from the dead to claim a new identity and destroy everything Rose had built, the tables were finally turning.<br/><br/>&quot;What will you do?&quot; she asked Herod. &quot;After?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Acquire what remains of Kane Industries at pennies on the dollar. Rebuild it in my own image.&quot; His eyes met hers. &quot;And you?&quot;<br/><br/>Rose hadn&#x27;t thought that far ahead. Her focus had been so completely on destruction that she&#x27;d given little consideration to what came after. &quot;I haven&#x27;t decided,&quot; she admitted.<br/><br/>Herod studied her face for a long moment. &quot;Perhaps,&quot; he said slowly, &quot;we might discuss possibilities. Over dinner.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose blinked, caught off guard by the suggestion. &quot;Dinner?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Tonight. My private chef makes an exceptional coq au vin.&quot; His tone remained businesslike, but something in his eyes suggested more than simple collaboration. &quot;We should celebrate our imminent success.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose found herself nodding before she had fully processed the invitation. &quot;I&#x27;d like that.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod&#x27;s smile was brief but genuine. &quot;Excellent. Eight o&#x27;clock.&quot; He glanced at his watch. &quot;But first, we should check in with our electrician. He should be installing the critical components within the hour.&quot;<br/><br/>He pressed a button on his desk phone. &quot;Bring the car around.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose gathered her coat, her mind racing with unexpected thoughts. The plan was perfect. Camille would lose everything, her reputation, her freedom, possibly even her life if she happened to be in the wrong place when the grid failed. Victoria Kane would watch her empire crumble, just as she had once destroyed the Preston family.<br/><br/>Yet as she followed Herod to the elevator, Rose found herself thinking not of revenge, but of dinner. Of the way Herod&#x27;s eyes had lingered on hers. Of the possibility that destroying Camille might be not an end, but a beginning.<br/><br/>The elevator doors closed, carrying them downward. They stood side by side, not touching but somehow connected by the invisible threads of shared purpose. Of mutual destruction turned to potential creation.<br/><br/>&quot;You&#x27;re smiling,&quot; Herod observed.<br/><br/>&quot;Am I?&quot; Rose hadn&#x27;t realized. &quot;I suppose I&#x27;m just looking forward to seeing Camille&#x27;s face when she realizes who destroyed her.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We,&quot; Herod corrected quietly. &quot;Who destroyed her.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose met his gaze in the mirrored wall of the elevator. For the first time in longer than she could remember, she didn&#x27;t feel alone in her hatred. Didn&#x27;t feel like the only one who saw through Camille&#x27;s perfect facade.<br/><br/>&quot;Yes,&quot; she agreed as the elevator reached the ground floor. &quot;We.&quot;<br/><br/>Outside, a sleek black car waited, engine running. As Rose slid into the leather seat, she realized something else unexpected, beyond the thrill of coming revenge, beyond the strange new connection with Herod, she felt alive. Truly alive.<br/><br/>Soon Camille would know how it felt to lose everything. To watch your world burn around you while those you trusted turned away. To fall from the heights Rose herself had been pushed from.<br/><br/>And from those ashes, perhaps something new would rise after all. Something Rose hadn&#x27;t dared to imagine. <br/><br/>Not just vengeance.<br/>But victory.<br/></div>
