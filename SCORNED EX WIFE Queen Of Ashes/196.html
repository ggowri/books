        <h1>Chapter 129-2</h1>
        <div><br/>&quot;We need to be smart about this,&quot; he said carefully. &quot;They&#x27;re expecting us to target the western junction. We need a new approach, something they won&#x27;t anticipate.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Like what?&quot; Rose demanded.<br/><br/>Herod remained silent for a moment, weighing options. Finally, he stood, moving to a wall safe concealed behind a painting. He entered the combination and retrieved a small thumb drive.<br/><br/>&quot;This contains plans for the main power relay station that controls the entire Grid,&quot; he explained. &quot;Not just the junction points, but the central hub itself. We obtained this months ago, before Walsh, through different channels.&quot;<br/><br/>He plugged the drive into his computer, careful to use a non-networked machine. &quot;If these schematics are still accurate, there&#x27;s a way to access the central control systems during the launch ceremony. Not through the Grid itself, but through the venue&#x27;s own infrastructure.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose moved closer, her fury temporarily contained by interest. &quot;Explain.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The launch ceremony is being held at Kane Industries headquarters. The building&#x27;s original power systems have been integrated with the Grid as part of the demonstration. There&#x27;s a maintenance access point in the basement that connects directly to the Grid&#x27;s central controls.&quot;<br/><br/>He pulled up a detailed blueprint of the Kane building. &quot;It wouldn&#x27;t give us control of the Grid itself, but it would allow us to disrupt the launch ceremony spectacularly. Blackouts, system failures, possibly even minor explosions from power surges.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Not enough,&quot; Rose said flatly. &quot;I don&#x27;t want to just embarrass Camille. I want to destroy her. Completely.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod studied her face, measuring his next words carefully. &quot;Then we combine approaches. The ceremony disruption provides a distraction. In the chaos, we implement... more direct measures.&quot;<br/><br/>The meaning hung between them, unspoken but clear. Rose&#x27;s eyes lit with dark anticipation.<br/><br/>&quot;Yes,&quot; she whispered. &quot;That&#x27;s exactly what we need.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod felt a chill at her enthusiasm for what he was suggesting. He had always meant to stop short of actual violence, to draw the line at financial and professional ruin. But Rose had moved beyond such boundaries.<br/><br/>&quot;It will require precise timing,&quot; he cautioned. &quot;And significant risk.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I don&#x27;t care about risk,&quot; Rose replied. &quot;I only care about results.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod&#x27;s computer emitted a soft beep. A warning appeared on screen, unexpected network activity detected. Someone was attempting to breach his security remotely.<br/><br/>&quot;They&#x27;re trying to access our systems,&quot; he said, quickly initiating countermeasures. &quot;The trackers must have opened a back door.&quot;<br/><br/>His fingers moved rapidly, shutting down connections, erecting firewalls, wiping temporary files. &quot;We need to go. Now. Bring only what&#x27;s essential.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose didn&#x27;t argue, moving immediately to gather her things. Her single-minded focus had shifted from rage to action, a cold determination replacing the hot fury of moments before.<br/><br/>Herod finished securing his system, then removed a small device from his desk drawer. He activated it with a series of commands.<br/><br/>&quot;What is that?&quot; Rose asked, returning with a small bag.<br/><br/>&quot;Signal jammer,&quot; he explained. &quot;It will disrupt any tracking devices within fifty feet. Should give us enough time to get clear.&quot;<br/><br/>They moved quickly through the penthouse, taking only what couldn&#x27;t be replaced. Herod activated a second security protocol with his phone, within hours, his financial assets would move through a series of offshore accounts, becoming virtually untraceable.<br/><br/>At the private elevator, Herod paused. &quot;Once we leave, we can&#x27;t come back. They&#x27;ll have this place under surveillance.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose didn&#x27;t hesitate. &quot;I don&#x27;t care about things. I only care about making Camille pay.&quot;<br/><br/>The elevator doors closed behind them. As they descended, Herod studied Rose&#x27;s profile. Her face had taken on a strange calm, the eye of a hurricane. He recognized the expression, someone who had moved beyond desperate to dangerous.<br/><br/>&quot;We have two days until the launch ceremony,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#x27;ll need to move quickly to implement the new plan.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose nodded, her gaze fixed on the descending floor numbers. &quot;Two days. After eighteen months of waiting, it seems fitting. Full circle.&quot;<br/><br/>The elevator reached the basement garage. Herod led the way to a car he kept registered under a different name, one not connected to any of his known identities.<br/><br/>As they drove away from the building, through a service exit to avoid the main entrance, Herod glanced in the rearview mirror. No signs of pursuit yet, but they wouldn&#x27;t be far behind. Camille and Victoria would have their best people hunting them now.<br/><br/>&quot;Where are we going?&quot; Rose asked, breaking the silence.<br/><br/>&quot;Somewhere they won&#x27;t think to look,&quot; Herod replied. &quot;A property not connected to either of us.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose nodded, accepting his vague answer without further questions. Her mind seemed elsewhere, likely already at the launch ceremony, imagining the chaos they would create.<br/><br/>Herod navigated through the city streets, taking a circuitous route to ensure they weren&#x27;t followed. His mind raced through contingencies, assessing risks, calculating odds. The rational part of him recognized that they should cut their losses, separate, disappear. The smarter play would be to walk away now, before they crossed lines that couldn&#x27;t be uncrossed.<br/><br/>But one look at Rose&#x27;s face told him that wasn&#x27;t an option. And despite everything, despite the danger and the increasing likelihood of failure, he couldn&#x27;t bring himself to abandon her. Not when they were so close to the culmination of their shared goal.<br/><br/>Victoria Kane had destroyed his family. Camille had risen from that destruction to become Victoria&#x27;s heir, her chosen successor. They deserved whatever came next.<br/><br/>Even if it meant crossing lines he had never intended to cross.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;ll need supplies,&quot; he said, breaking the silence. &quot;Equipment for the new plan.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose turned to him, something almost like a smile playing at her lips. &quot;I already have everything we need.&quot; The cold determination in her voice sent another chill through him.<br/><br/>He wondered, not for the first time, exactly what he had unleashed by partnering with Rose Lewis. And whether either of them would survive what came next.<br/></div>
