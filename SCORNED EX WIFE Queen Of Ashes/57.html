        <h1>Chapter 47</h1>
        <div><p>Chapter 47<br/><br/>Camille&#x27;s point of view <br/><br/>The morning sun cast long shadows across my desk as I reviewed the latest reports on Rodriguez Shipping&#x27;s supply chain. Five of their key suppliers had abruptly terminated contracts in the past twenty-four hours. Two more were scheduled to announce their withdrawal by noon. Each one citing &quot;business concerns&quot; or &quot;strategic realignment&quot; – corporate speak for abandoning a sinking ship.<br/><br/>What none of them mentioned was the quiet pressure from Kane Industries. The subtle threats about future business relationships. The anonymous tips about Rodriguez financial instability. The carefully orchestrated market manipulation that made partnering with Stefan&#x27;s company look increasingly dangerous.<br/><br/>&quot;Ms. Kane.&quot; My assistant Rebecca knocked before entering, tablet in hand. &quot;Marunouchi Trading just announced their withdrawal. Their statement hit the financial press five minutes ago.&quot;<br/><br/>I nodded, satisfaction warming my blood. Marunouchi was Stefan&#x27;s largest Asian supplier, accounting for nearly thirty percent of his Pacific shipping materials.<br/><br/>&quot;How did the market react?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Rodriguez stock dropped another eight points in pre-market trading.&quot; Rebecca couldn&#x27;t hide her admiration. &quot;At this rate, they&#x27;ll be below their IPO price by next week.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And Stefan?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Scheduled an emergency board meeting for tomorrow morning. His father is flying back from Europe tonight.&quot; Rebecca&#x27;s efficiency reflected the months of training Victoria had invested in all staff who worked directly with me.<br/><br/>Good. Let him feel the walls closing in. Let him experience the helpless panic I&#x27;d felt when my own life crumbled beneath me.<br/><br/>Victoria entered as Rebecca was leaving, impeccable as always in a tailored navy suit that conveyed power without effort. Her eyes took in the market data on my screens with evident satisfaction.<br/><br/>&quot;I see Marunouchi made their announcement,&quot; she said, moving to stand beside my desk. &quot;Your strategy is working even better than projected.&quot;<br/><br/>She studied me, head tilted slightly. &quot;You&#x27;ve done exceptional work targeting his supply chain. Where did you obtain such detailed knowledge of their dependencies?&quot;<br/><br/>I kept my expression neutral. &quot;Research. Planning. Careful analysis.&quot;<br/><br/>Not entirely a lie. But not the whole truth either. I didn&#x27;t mention the nights I&#x27;d spent listening to Stefan talk about his company&#x27;s operations. The dinners where he&#x27;d explained supply chain dynamics to me, thinking his wife too simple to truly understand. The business meetings I&#x27;d attended as &quot;support&quot; while absorbing every detail.<br/><br/>His underestimation of me then had become his vulnerability now.<br/><br/>&quot;Well, your analysis was flawless.&quot; Victoria nodded with genuine approval, rare from a woman who seldom offered praise. <br/><br/>Rebecca knocked again, appearing in the doorway. &quot;Ms. Kane, just a reminder that the second batch of Rose&#x27;s photos is scheduled to release at noon. Entertainment sites first, then fashion blogs, then mainstream news. The media team is standing by.&quot;<br/><br/>My finger hovered over my keyboard, the final command queued and ready. These photos would hurt Rose far more than the first batch. Not just affairs and indiscretions, but evidence of her time with Anton Bessonov. Her connections to his questionable business dealings. Her presence on his yacht during negotiations later flagged by international authorities.<br/><br/>One keystroke would send her professional reputation from damaged to destroyed.<br/><br/>I pressed enter.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s done,&quot; I said, a strange mix of emotions washing through me. Victory, yes. But also something darker. Something that felt uncomfortably like becoming what I hated most about my sister.<br/><br/>Victoria observed me with that penetrating gaze that always seemed to see beneath my carefully maintained facade. &quot;You hesitated before pressing enter. Having doubts?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No,&quot; I replied, perhaps too quickly. &quot;Just savoring the moment.&quot;<br/><br/>She studied me for another beat before accepting my answer with a slight nod. &quot;I&#x27;ll be in strategic planning until two. Have Rebecca update me on the public reaction as it develops.&quot;<br/><br/>Rebecca appeared in the doorway again, as if summoned by her name. &quot;I&#x27;ll have the media team monitor reaction and amplify key narratives, Ms. Kane.&quot;<br/><br/>After she left, I pulled up the live feed from the security camera outside Rose&#x27;s boutique. We&#x27;d installed it weeks ago, ensuring I could witness her world unraveling in real time.<br/><br/>It took exactly twenty-seven minutes for the news to reach her. I watched her assistant rush out to the waiting car, phone extended urgently. Saw Rose&#x27;s perfect posture crumple slightly as she read the headlines. Watched color drain from her face as photographers swarmed, suddenly alert to a story breaking before their eyes.<br/><br/>For a brief, wonderful moment, pure panic overtook her features. Then, like the performer she&#x27;d always been, she recovered. Forced a smile. Waved off questions with practiced grace.<br/><br/>But I&#x27;d seen it. That flash of genuine fear. That instant recognition that her carefully constructed life was truly falling apart.<br/><br/>It should have felt sweeter.<br/><br/>My phone buzzed with a text from Alexander: *The queen takes another piece from the board. Impressive moves, little phoenix.*<br/><br/>How did he always know? Every strike against Rose and Stefan, every carefully orchestrated attack, somehow Alexander Pierce tracked them all, commenting with his odd mix of admiration and concern.<br/><br/>I pushed away the question, focusing instead on the financial terminals tracking Rodriguez Shipping&#x27;s continued decline. The stock had opened another six percent down. News alerts showed shipping customers seeking alternative partners. Industry analysts questioning the company&#x27;s future viability.<br/><br/>My phone buzzed with a text from our source inside Rodriguez Shipping: *Complete chaos here. Stefan locked in emergency meetings all day. Board members threatening resignation. His father shouting about family legacy destroyed.*<br/><br/>I smiled at the update. Let him feel the walls closing in. Let him experience the helpless panic I&#x27;d felt when my own life crumbled beneath me.<br/><br/>On my screens, financial news channels were now covering Rodriguez Shipping&#x27;s crisis as breaking news. Market analysts questioning the company&#x27;s survival. Industry experts speculating about who might acquire their routes once bankruptcy became inevitable.<br/><br/>&quot;Should we prepare a statement about Kane Industries&#x27; interest in certain Rodriguez assets?&quot; Victoria asked, watching the coverage with satisfaction. &quot;The market would respond well to hints we might acquire their Pacific routes.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Not yet,&quot; I replied, strategic even in my revenge. &quot;Let the value drop further before showing our hand.&quot;<br/><br/>On my screen, financial news channels were now covering Rodriguez Shipping&#x27;s crisis as breaking news. Market analysts questioning the company&#x27;s survival. Industry experts speculating about who might acquire their routes once bankruptcy became inevitable.<br/><br/>Rebecca returned, excitement barely contained beneath her professional demeanor. &quot;Ms. Kane, the Rose photos are performing beyond expectations. Three major fashion houses have publicly severed ties with her brand. Her main manufacturing partner just announced they&#x27;re &#x27;reevaluating their relationship.&#x27;&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And the Russian connection?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Already picked up by mainstream news.&quot; Rebecca couldn&#x27;t hide her admiration for our strategy. &quot;They&#x27;re asking if she helped launder money through her early designs. If her current business was built on criminal funding. By end of day, she&#x27;ll be toxic to any legitimate business partner.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria entered as Rebecca was delivering her report, satisfaction evident in her rare smile. She nodded approvingly at the metrics displayed on my screens.<br/><br/>I nodded, moving to the window overlooking Manhattan. Somewhere out there, Rose was watching her career implode. Stefan was fighting to save his family legacy. Both experiencing the same helpless panic they&#x27;d once inflicted on me.<br/><br/>Justice, I reminded myself. Not revenge. Justice for years of manipulation and betrayal.<br/><br/>So why did victory taste increasingly bitter?<br/><br/>&quot;Stefan called me directly,&quot; I said, still watching the city below. &quot;Begging for a meeting.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s reflection in the window showed her sharp interest. &quot;And you said?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Next Tuesday. Fifteen minutes.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Excellent.&quot; She moved beside me. &quot;The perfect opportunity to witness his desperation firsthand. To watch him beg without understanding who truly holds his fate.&quot;<br/><br/>The thought should have thrilled me. Once, it would have. Now I felt only a strange hollowness.<br/><br/>&quot;What happens when it&#x27;s over?&quot; I asked quietly. &quot;When they&#x27;re both destroyed completely?&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria studied me carefully. &quot;We move forward. You take your rightful place as my heir. We build something greater than either of us could alone.&quot;<br/><br/>But that wasn&#x27;t what I&#x27;d asked. Not really. The question I couldn&#x27;t quite voice was simpler: Who would I be when revenge no longer defined me?<br/><br/>My phone buzzed with another message from Alexander: *When the game ends and all pieces are captured, what then for the queen? Perhaps we should discuss over dinner tomorrow.*<br/><br/>I turned away from the window, deliberately ignoring both Victoria&#x27;s questioning look and Alexander&#x27;s message. On my desk, reports showed Stefan&#x27;s company bleeding value by the minute. On my screens, entertainment sites splashed Rose&#x27;s scandalous past for all to see.<br/><br/>This was what I&#x27;d wanted. What I&#x27;d planned for months. What I&#x27;d changed my entire identity to achieve.<br/><br/>Victory. Revenge. Justice.<br/><br/>Rebecca knocked before entering again. &quot;Ms. Kane, the board is requesting your assessment of Rodriguez Shipping&#x27;s remaining assets. They&#x27;d like recommendations on which pieces might be worth acquiring once the company is forced to sell.&quot;<br/><br/>I nodded, returning to business. To the careful, methodical destruction of those who had destroyed me. To the path I&#x27;d chosen and could no longer deviate from.<br/><br/>Yet as Victoria outlined our next moves against Stefan&#x27;s failing company, part of me wondered if Alexander&#x27;s question deserved consideration.<br/><br/>When the game ends and all pieces are captured, what then for the queen?</p></div>
