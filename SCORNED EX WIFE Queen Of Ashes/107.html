        <h1>Chapter 77-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 77<br/><br/>Rain pounded against the windows of Camille&#x27;s office, matching her mood as she stared at the notification on her phone. The message was brief: her parents were waiting in the lobby. No warning, no call ahead. They had simply shown up, expecting her to drop everything and see them.<br/><br/>Some things never changed.<br/><br/>&quot;Ms. Kane?&quot; Rebecca stood in the doorway, her expression concerned. &quot;Your... the Lewises are downstairs. They&#x27;re insisting on seeing you.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille set down her pen, her fingers surprisingly steady despite the storm brewing inside her. &quot;How long have they been waiting?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Almost an hour. They refuse to leave without speaking to you.&quot;<br/><br/>Of course they did. Margaret and Richard Lewis had always believed doors should open for them, that their demands warranted immediate attention. Even now, after everything that had happened, they expected their daughter, the daughter they had failed so completely, to bend to their will.<br/><br/>&quot;Send them up in fifteen minutes,&quot; Camille said, turning back to her computer. &quot;Not a second earlier.&quot;<br/><br/>Rebecca nodded and disappeared, leaving Camille alone with thoughts she had tried to bury since the Phoenix Gala. Unlike with Stefan, whose visit she had anticipated and prepared for, this confrontation caught her off guard. She had hoped her parents would respect her wishes, would understand that some bridges couldn&#x27;t be rebuilt.<br/><br/>But hope had always been her weakness where family was concerned.<br/><br/>Camille stood and walked to the window, watching raindrops race down the glass. The sky had turned nearly black, thunder rumbling in the distance. A perfect backdrop for the scene about to unfold.<br/><br/>Fifteen minutes later, Rebecca&#x27;s voice came through the intercom. &quot;They&#x27;re here, Ms. Kane.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Send them in,&quot; Camille replied, remaining by the window, her back to the door.<br/><br/>She heard them enter, heard her mother&#x27;s sharp intake of breath, heard her father clear his throat, that familiar sound that had always preceded his lectures. Camille didn&#x27;t turn around.<br/><br/>&quot;Camille,&quot; her mother&#x27;s voice broke on her name. &quot;Please look at us.&quot;<br/><br/>Slowly, Camille turned. They looked smaller somehow, diminished. Her mother&#x27;s carefully maintained appearance showed cracks, hair not quite perfect, makeup slightly smudged from the rain or perhaps tears. Her father stood straight as always, but new lines marked his face, and his eyes held none of their usual confidence.<br/><br/>&quot;Why are you here?&quot; Camille asked, her voice flat.<br/><br/>&quot;Because you&#x27;re our daughter,&quot; her father said, as if that explained everything, as if the word &quot;daughter&quot; still meant anything between them.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;ve been going out of our minds,&quot; her mother added, taking a step forward. &quot;Ever since the gala, we&#x27;ve been trying to process everything. To understand how....&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;How I survived?&quot; Camille finished for her. &quot;How I became someone new? Or how your precious Rose tried to have me killed?&quot;<br/><br/>Her mother flinched. &quot;All of it. Please, Camille. We need to talk about this.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;There&#x27;s nothing to talk about.&quot; Camille moved back to her desk, putting the solid oak barrier between them. &quot;I said everything I needed to say at the gala.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You can&#x27;t mean that,&quot; her father insisted, moving closer. &quot;We&#x27;re your parents. Whatever mistakes we&#x27;ve made....&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Mistakes?&quot; Camille&#x27;s laugh held no humor. &quot;Is that what you call it? A mistake?&quot;<br/><br/>Her father faltered, then straightened his shoulders. &quot;We had no idea what Rose had done. How could we possibly have known?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Because I told you,&quot; Camille replied, her voice rising despite her efforts to stay calm. &quot;I stood in our family home and told you both that Rose was having an affair with Stefan. That she had manipulated both of us. And what did you do? You defended her. You chose her.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We didn&#x27;t believe it because it seemed impossible,&quot; her mother said, tears spilling onto her cheeks. &quot;Rose has been part of our family since she was thirteen. We raised her, loved her...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You didn&#x27;t raise her,&quot; Camille cut in. &quot;You adopted a teenager who had already formed her worldview, who saw our family as a prize she had won, not a gift of love. And you didn&#x27;t just love her, you favored her. You always did.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s not true,&quot; her father protested, but the doubt in his eyes betrayed him.<br/><br/>&quot;Isn&#x27;t it? When Rose got a B in math, you hired a tutor and praised her efforts. When I got an A-, you asked why it wasn&#x27;t an A. When Rose wore something you didn&#x27;t approve of, it was &#x27;expressing herself.&#x27; When I did the same, I was &#x27;embarrassing the family.&#x27;&quot; <br/><br/>The memories rushed back, a lifetime of small cuts that had bled her confidence dry. &quot;And it wasn&#x27;t just when we were young. When I told you Stefan was cheating, your first instinct wasn&#x27;t to comfort me or protect me, it was to question whether I had somehow caused it.&quot;<br/><br/>Her mother shook her head desperately. &quot;We didn&#x27;t mean to hurt you. We loved you both equally...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No,&quot; Camille said softly. &quot;You didn&#x27;t. And deep down, you know that&#x27;s true.&quot;<br/><br/>Silence filled the room, broken only by the thunder outside and her mother&#x27;s muffled sobs.<br/><br/>&quot;Camille,&quot; her father finally said, his voice rough. &quot;We&#x27;ve made terrible mistakes. Unforgivable ones. But you&#x27;re alive, our daughter is alive. Surely that&#x27;s a second chance, a miracle. Can&#x27;t we at least try to heal this?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Heal what, exactly?&quot; Camille asked. &quot;The fact that you never truly saw me? That you believed the worst of me and the best of Rose, no matter the evidence? That when I needed you most, you abandoned me for the daughter you preferred?&quot;<br/><br/>Her father&#x27;s face crumpled, his carefully maintained facade finally breaking. &quot;We were wrong. So terribly wrong. When we heard about your... your death, it destroyed us. We&#x27;ve spent the last year living with the knowledge that our last conversation with you was an argument, that you died believing we didn&#x27;t love you.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And now that I&#x27;m not dead, you want absolution.&quot; Camille&#x27;s voice remained steady, though her heart pounded painfully in her chest. &quot;You want me to tell you it&#x27;s okay, that I forgive you, so you can sleep at night.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We want our daughter back,&quot; her mother pleaded, moving around the desk to reach for Camille&#x27;s hand. Camille stepped away, maintaining the distance between them.<br/><br/>&quot;Your daughter is gone,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;Camille Lewis died that night in the parking garage. The woman standing before you is someone else entirely.&quot;</div>
