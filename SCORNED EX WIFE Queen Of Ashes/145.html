        <h1>Chapter 100-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 100<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s hands shook as she poured herself a drink in her office. The setting sun cast long shadows across the room. Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, New York City sparkled, unaware of the storm brewing among its towering buildings.<br/><br/>&quot;Herod Preston,&quot; Victoria whispered the name like a curse, staring into her glass. &quot;After all these years...&quot;<br/><br/>Camille had never seen Victoria like this, unsteady, shaken to her core. Since Alexander had revealed Rose&#x27;s partner at the groundbreaking, Victoria had barely spoken, rushing them back to Kane Industries headquarters with security doubled.<br/><br/>&quot;You need to tell me everything,&quot; Camille said. &quot;Who is he? What does he want?&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria drained her glass in one swallow. &quot;Herod Preston is the younger brother of Charles Preston. The man who was engaged to my daughter Sophia before her death.&quot;<br/><br/>She set her glass down with a sharp click.<br/><br/>&quot;Charles Preston&#x27;s family owned Preston Shipping, once a rival to Kane Industries. They were old money, very powerful. They didn&#x27;t approve of Charles marrying Sophia. When they couldn&#x27;t break the engagement, they arranged her car accident.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander stood by the window, listening silently.<br/><br/>&quot;You told me this before,&quot; Camille said softly. &quot;You took revenge on them. Destroyed their company.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s laugh held no humor. &quot;I did more than that. I made sure every Preston lost everything. Charles committed suicide six months after Sophia&#x27;s death. Their father drank himself to death a year later.&quot; She paused. &quot;But Herod... he was just nineteen when it happened. Away at college. I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to him.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;But he blames you for what happened to his family,&quot; Alexander said.<br/><br/>Victoria nodded. &quot;Apparently. I heard he dropped out after his father died. Disappeared. I assumed he&#x27;d gone abroad, living on whatever scraps the family had hidden away.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Alexander, what did your sources find?&quot; Camille asked.<br/><br/>Alexander crossed the room, pulling up files on his tablet. &quot;Herod Preston has been operating under various aliases for the past decade. He built a fortune in Asia, property development, mostly. Very successful. Very quiet. He returned to the States two years ago and has been buying up companies through shell corporations.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;How did he find Rose?&quot; Camille asked.<br/><br/>&quot;More likely she found him,&quot; Victoria said. &quot;Rose has always had a talent for sniffing out useful allies. And someone hungry for revenge against me would be irresistible to her.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille rose from her chair. &quot;So this isn&#x27;t just about me anymore. Rose brought Herod into this because he wants to hurt you. By targeting the Phoenix Grid, he strikes at both of us.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s eyes met Camille&#x27;s. &quot;Yes. And Camille, I&#x27;m sorry. I&#x27;ve put you in danger. Again.&quot;<br/><br/>The raw pain in Victoria&#x27;s voice stripped away years of her carefully constructed armor. In that moment, she wasn&#x27;t the powerful CEO, the vengeful mother, the calculating mentor. She was simply a woman frightened of losing another daughter.<br/><br/>Camille crossed the room and knelt beside Victoria&#x27;s chair, taking her cold hands. &quot;No. Don&#x27;t you dare blame yourself. Rose is my fight. She&#x27;s been my fight since she tried to kill me.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;But Herod...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Herod made his choice when he partnered with Rose. When he targeted the Phoenix Grid.&quot; Camille squeezed Victoria&#x27;s hands. &quot;We&#x27;ve faced enemies before. We&#x27;ll face this one too.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria shook her head. &quot;You don&#x27;t understand. The Prestons were different. Charles was... unstable. Brilliant but unhinged. Herod was always the same, quieter, more calculating. If he&#x27;s spent ten years planning this...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Then we&#x27;ll spend however long it takes stopping him,&quot; Camille finished firmly. She stood up. &quot;I won&#x27;t let you fight him alone.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria looked up, surprise flashing across her face.<br/><br/>&quot;From the moment you found me in that parking garage, you&#x27;ve fought for me,&quot; Camille continued. &quot;You reshaped me. Gave me purpose. A new life. Everything I am now, I owe to you.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Camille...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No, let me finish.&quot; Camille&#x27;s voice grew stronger. &quot;You taught me to never show weakness. To always strike first. To use every resource at my disposal.&quot; She placed her hand over Victoria&#x27;s. &quot;Well, now I&#x27;m using the most valuable resource I have, you. We fight together. We win together.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander stepped closer. &quot;She&#x27;s right, Victoria. Divided, Herod and Rose can pick us off one by one. Together, they don&#x27;t stand a chance.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s eyes moved between them, something shifting in her expression. Slowly, the familiar steel returned to her gaze.<br/><br/>&quot;Together,&quot; she repeated, as if testing the word. &quot;It&#x27;s been a long time since I trusted anyone enough to fight alongside them.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Then it&#x27;s about time you started,&quot; Camille said.<br/><br/>Victoria stood, smoothing her suit jacket. &quot;They&#x27;ll expect us to be defensive now. To focus on protecting the Grid. Especially after the groundbreaking.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander nodded. &quot;Which means we need to be offensive instead.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Exactly.&quot; Victoria moved to her desk, pressing the intercom. &quot;Sarah, get me the files on all Preston family holdings from ten years ago. And schedule a meeting with the legal team for seven AM tomorrow.&quot;<br/><br/>She released the button and turned back to Camille and Alexander. &quot;If Herod&#x27;s been operating under aliases, there must be a paper trail somewhere. We find his assets, we find his weaknesses.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ll have my team working through the night,&quot; Alexander said.<br/><br/>Camille watched them shift into strategic mode, but her mind was elsewhere.... on Rose. Rose, who had manipulated everyone since childhood. Rose, who wouldn&#x27;t stop until she had destroyed everything Camille loved.<br/><br/>&quot;What are you thinking?&quot; Victoria asked.<br/><br/>&quot;Rose won&#x27;t be satisfied with just damaging the Grid,&quot; Camille said slowly. &quot;She wants me to suffer. To watch everything I care about burn.&quot;<br/><br/>She turned to face them both.<br/><br/>&quot;Which means she&#x27;ll target the people I love too.&quot;</div>
