        <h1>Chapter 78-2</h1>
        <div><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ve reviewed Mr. Pierce&#x27;s proposal extensively,&quot; she began, her voice steady. &quot;The technology is solid. The financial models are sound. Yes, there are risks, significant ones. But there&#x27;s something more important than the financial projections.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s eyebrow raised slightly, a warning, perhaps, or a test.<br/><br/>&quot;This project represents exactly what Kane Industries claims to value, innovation that improves lives.&quot; Camille met Victoria&#x27;s gaze directly. &quot;We can proceed cautiously and be one more company making incremental improvements. Or we can be bold and change the world.&quot;<br/><br/>The room fell silent. Alexander remained perfectly still beside her, neither helping nor hindering, allowing her to stand on her own.<br/><br/>&quot;What exactly are you proposing?&quot; Victoria asked, her tone neutral.<br/><br/>&quot;A full-scale implementation in one major city. Not a test, not a pilot, the complete system.&quot; Camille activated her own presentation, showing modified projections. &quot;I&#x27;ve adjusted Mr. Pierce&#x27;s models to account for increased initial costs and slower adoption rates. Even with these conservative estimates, the project remains viable.&quot;<br/><br/>The board members leaned forward, studying the numbers with renewed interest.<br/><br/>&quot;And the risk?&quot; one of them asked.<br/><br/>&quot;Substantial,&quot; Camille acknowledged. &quot;But calculated. And shared equally with Pierce Innovations.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander nodded his agreement. &quot;We&#x27;re prepared to match Kane Industries&#x27; investment dollar for dollar. Equal risk, equal reward.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s expression remained unreadable as she studied Camille. Something passed between them, an understanding, perhaps, or a shift in their relationship. Mentor and protégé, but also two women who had rebuilt themselves from ashes.<br/><br/>&quot;The board will need time to consider,&quot; Victoria said finally. &quot;We&#x27;ll reconvene tomorrow morning for a vote.&quot;<br/><br/>As the meeting adjourned, board members surrounded Alexander, asking technical questions about the proposal. Victoria motioned for Camille to follow her into a private office adjacent to the conference room.<br/><br/>&quot;That was quite a presentation,&quot; Victoria said once they were alone. &quot;Not what we discussed.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille met her gaze steadily. &quot;You asked for my assessment. I gave it.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You contradicted me in front of the board.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I offered a different perspective,&quot; Camille corrected gently. &quot;Isn&#x27;t that why you put me in charge of this project? To bring new ideas?&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria studied her, those sharp eyes missing nothing. &quot;Alexander Pierce is dangerous. Brilliant, but dangerous. He plays games within games.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;So do you,&quot; Camille replied. &quot;So do I, now.&quot;<br/><br/>A small smile touched Victoria&#x27;s lips. &quot;Yes, you do. That&#x27;s what worries me.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You don&#x27;t trust him.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I don&#x27;t trust anyone completely.&quot; Victoria moved to the window, looking out at the city below. &quot;That&#x27;s how I&#x27;ve survived this long. But this isn&#x27;t about trust, it&#x27;s about you.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What about me?&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria turned back to face her. &quot;You&#x27;ve completed your revenge. Rose is destroyed. Stefan is broken. Your parents have been cast out. The fire that drove you has burned its fuel. Now you need something new to live for.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille felt exposed suddenly, as if Victoria had read her most private thoughts. &quot;And you think this project with Alexander is that something?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I think Alexander Pierce sees in you what I saw, tremendous potential. But his motivations may not be as altruistic as they appear.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You mean he might be using me to get to you,&quot; Camille said.<br/><br/>Victoria shook her head. &quot;No. I mean he might genuinely care for you. And that could be far more dangerous.&quot;<br/><br/>The words hung between them as Camille processed their meaning. Victoria wasn&#x27;t worried about business rivalry, she was concerned about Camille&#x27;s heart, about the possibility of new pain for someone who had already endured so much.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m not the same person who fell for Stefan&#x27;s charm,&quot; Camille said quietly. &quot;I&#x27;ve learned to see beneath surfaces.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Have you?&quot; Victoria&#x27;s voice held no judgment, only genuine concern. &quot;Alexander&#x27;s not Stefan. He&#x27;s infinitely more complex, more careful. If he&#x27;s showing you vulnerability, it&#x27;s because he&#x27;s chosen to.&quot;<br/><br/>Before Camille could respond, a knock at the door interrupted them. Alexander stood in the doorway, his expression carefully neutral.<br/><br/>&quot;Excuse the interruption. The board has some additional questions about the financial structure.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria nodded. &quot;We&#x27;ll continue this discussion later,&quot; she said to Camille, her tone making it clear this wasn&#x27;t a request.<br/><br/>As Victoria left to rejoin the board, Alexander remained in the doorway, watching Camille with those perceptive eyes.<br/><br/>&quot;She&#x27;s warning you against me,&quot; he said, not a question but a statement.<br/><br/>&quot;She&#x27;s being cautious,&quot; Camille replied. &quot;It&#x27;s her nature.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And what&#x27;s your nature now, Camille Kane? Caution or boldness?&quot;<br/><br/>The question echoed their earlier conversation, but with new meaning. They both knew he wasn&#x27;t just talking about business strategy.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m still figuring that out,&quot; she admitted.<br/><br/>Alexander stepped into the room, closing the distance between them. &quot;For what it&#x27;s worth, I believe in this project. But more than that, I believe in your ability to lead it.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Why?&quot; The question escaped before she could stop it.<br/><br/>&quot;Because you understand what it means to be reborn,&quot; he said simply. &quot;To rise from destruction. This isn&#x27;t just about clean energy or profit margins for me. It&#x27;s about transformation, giving cities the chance to shed their old, destructive patterns and become something better.&quot;<br/><br/>For the first time, Camille saw beyond Alexander&#x27;s carefully constructed persona, the brilliant businessman, the strategic competitor. What she glimpsed instead was someone shaped by his own private pain, someone who had also rebuilt himself from ruins.<br/><br/>&quot;The Phoenix Grid,&quot; she said softly, understanding the name&#x27;s significance now. &quot;It&#x27;s not just a marketing term for you.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No,&quot; he agreed. &quot;Just as &#x27;Camille Kane&#x27; isn&#x27;t just a name for you.&quot;<br/><br/>They stood in silence for a moment, each recognizing in the other a kindred spirit, someone who understood transformation from the inside out.<br/><br/>&quot;The board will approve the project,&quot; Camille said finally. &quot;Victoria&#x27;s concerns are valid, but the potential outweighs the risk.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And after they approve it?&quot; Alexander asked. &quot;Will you truly lead it as you see fit, or will you follow Victoria&#x27;s vision?&quot;<br/><br/>The challenge in his voice was clear. He wasn&#x27;t just offering a business partnership; he was offering her a chance to step fully into her own power, to move beyond Victoria&#x27;s shadow.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ll lead it,&quot; Camille said, surprising herself with the certainty in her voice. &quot;My way.&quot;<br/><br/>Something shifted in Alexander&#x27;s expression, respect, perhaps, or satisfaction. &quot;Then I look forward to our collaboration, Ms. Kane.&quot;<br/><br/>He extended his hand, and after a moment&#x27;s hesitation, she took it. His grip was warm and firm, the contact sending an unexpected current up her arm.<br/><br/>&quot;To new beginnings,&quot; he said quietly.<br/><br/>As their hands remained joined a moment longer than necessary, Camille felt something stir within her that she had thought dead forever, not just purpose or ambition, but possibility. The chance to create rather than destroy. The potential for a future defined not by what she had lost, but by what she might build.<br/><br/>&quot;To new beginnings,&quot; she echoed, and for the first time in longer than she could remember, the smile that curved her lips reached her eyes.<br/></div>
