        <h1>Chapter 148-2</h1>
        <div><br/>&quot;I know what the doctor said,&quot; Victoria interrupted. &quot;But we have a gala in a few hours, and my daughter just received difficult news. Resting can wait.&quot;<br/><br/>Daughter. The word hung in the air between them. Victoria had never called her that before, not directly. Just as Camille had never called her &quot;Mommy&quot; until today.<br/><br/>&quot;There won&#x27;t be a gala,&quot; Camille said suddenly. &quot;Not tonight. Not with you like this.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Especially tonight. Especially with me like this.&quot; Victoria&#x27;s voice regained its familiar steel. &quot;We don&#x27;t show weakness, Camille. Not to the world. Not to our enemies. And certainly not to Rose.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I don&#x27;t care about Rose right now,&quot; Camille snapped. &quot;I care about you.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Then honor my wishes,&quot; Victoria said. &quot;Stand beside me at the gala. Show everyone that Kane Industries remains strong, regardless of what happens to me personally.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille looked to Alexander for support, but his expression told her he agreed with Victoria. Of course he did. He always saw the strategic angle, just like Victoria herself.<br/><br/>&quot;Fine,&quot; Camille relented, wiping tears from her cheeks. &quot;The gala goes on. But afterwards, we talk about treatment options. Real options, not just palliative care.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria nodded, though something in her eyes suggested she was merely humoring Camille. &quot;Of course.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I need some air,&quot; Camille said, moving toward the door. &quot;I&#x27;ll be on the roof.&quot;<br/><br/>She left without looking back, unable to bear another moment in that office with its medical files and pill bottles and unspoken goodbyes.<br/><br/>The elevator ride to the roof passed in a blur. Once outside, the cold air hit her face, a shock that somehow failed to clear her mind. Camille walked to the edge, gripping the railing as she looked out over the city.<br/><br/>Victoria was dying. The woman who had saved her, transformed her, given her a second chance at life—was slipping away. And Camille hadn&#x27;t even noticed.<br/><br/>She heard the roof door open behind her but didn&#x27;t turn. Alexander&#x27;s footsteps approached, stopping just behind her.<br/><br/>&quot;Go away,&quot; Camille said. &quot;I don&#x27;t want to talk right now.&quot;<br/><br/>Instead of leaving, Alexander moved beside her at the railing. &quot;Then we won&#x27;t talk.&quot;<br/><br/>They stood in silence, watching the city below. After a long while, Camille spoke.<br/><br/>&quot;How long have you known?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Since just after her surgery,&quot; Alexander admitted. &quot;She made me promise not to tell you.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And you always keep your promises,&quot; Camille said bitterly.<br/><br/>&quot;Not always.&quot; Alexander&#x27;s voice was gentle. &quot;But I try to respect the wishes of people I care about. Victoria wanted to tell you herself, when she felt you were ready.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;When would that have been? At her funeral?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;She was trying to protect you.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s what she said too.&quot; Camille&#x27;s grip tightened on the railing. &quot;But it feels more like she didn&#x27;t trust me. Didn&#x27;t think I was strong enough to handle the truth.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander turned to face her. &quot;Victoria has never doubted your strength, Camille. If anything, she was protecting herself. From your grief. From having to face what her death would mean to you.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille hadn&#x27;t considered that. That Victoria, stoic, practical Victoria, might be afraid of emotional vulnerability. Of seeing her own pain reflected in Camille&#x27;s eyes.<br/><br/>&quot;I called her Mommy,&quot; Camille whispered, still shocked by her own outburst. &quot;I&#x27;ve never called her that before.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s expression softened. &quot;What did she do?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;She cried,&quot; Camille said, the memory fresh and painful. &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen her cry before.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander pulled her into his arms then, holding her as fresh tears came. &quot;That&#x27;s because you gave her something she never thought she&#x27;d have again after Sophia died. A daughter who loves her as a mother, not just as a mentor or boss.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille buried her face against his chest, allowing herself to break in a way she couldn&#x27;t in front of Victoria. Alexander&#x27;s arms tightened around her, solid and warm against the cold wind.<br/><br/>&quot;I can&#x27;t lose her,&quot; Camille sobbed. &quot;I can&#x27;t do this without her.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes, you can,&quot; Alexander said, his voice firm but gentle. &quot;It will hurt. It will feel impossible. But you are stronger than you know, Camille. Victoria sees that strength in you, even if you don&#x27;t see it yourself.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille pulled back enough to look at him, her vision blurred with tears. &quot;How do I face this? How do I walk into that gala tonight and pretend everything is normal when my world is falling apart?&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander wiped a tear from her cheek with his thumb. &quot;One step at a time. One moment at a time. And not alone.&quot; He pressed his forehead to hers. &quot;Never alone.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille closed her eyes, drawing strength from his presence. After a while, her breathing steadied. The initial shock of Victoria&#x27;s revelation was fading, leaving a dull ache in its place.<br/><br/>&quot;We should go back down,&quot; she said eventually. &quot;Victoria needs us. And we have a gala to prepare for.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander nodded, taking her hand as they walked toward the door. Just before they reached it, Camille paused.<br/><br/>&quot;Alexander,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;Promise me something.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Anything.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No more secrets. No matter how painful the truth might be. No matter who asks you to keep it from me.&quot; Her eyes held his, demanding honesty. &quot;Promise me.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander looked at her for a long moment, then nodded. &quot;I promise.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille took a deep breath, then opened the door. It was time to face Victoria again. Time to face the future however difficult, however painful, that awaited them all.<br/><br/>As Camille stepped inside, she wondered if this was what true strength meant, not the absence of pain, but the ability to carry it without being crushed beneath its weight.<br/></div>
