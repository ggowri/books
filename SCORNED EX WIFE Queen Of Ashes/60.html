        <h1>Chapter 49-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 49<br/><br/>The view from the seventy-eighth floor of Pierce Tower turned Manhattan into a miniature city, tiny lights flickering like stars below. Alexander stood at the floor-to-ceiling window, phone pressed to his ear, watching darkness spread across the skyline. His reflection stared back at him, perfectly tailored suit, carefully neutral expression, eyes that revealed nothing of the game he was playing.<br/><br/>&quot;I understand your interest in Rose Lewis&#x27;s fashion line, Mr. Hiroshi,&quot; he said, voice smooth as aged whiskey. &quot;But my analysis suggests it would be an unwise investment at this time. The brand carries significant hidden liabilities.&quot;<br/><br/>The Japanese investor on the other end sounded disappointed. &quot;Our research indicated solid growth potential despite recent... difficulties.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Your research is incomplete,&quot; Alexander replied, moving to his desk where three monitors displayed financial data on Rose&#x27;s collapsing business. &quot;I&#x27;ve taken the liberty of sending you some additional information. Check your secure email.&quot;<br/><br/>He&#x27;d spent hours compiling this dossier – rumors of design theft, details of canceled retail contracts, hints of connections to Bessonov&#x27;s questionable finances. All true, all damaging, all impossible to ignore for a cautious investor like Hiroshi.<br/><br/>&quot;This is... most concerning,&quot; Hiroshi said after a lengthy pause. &quot;You&#x27;ve saved me from a significant mistake, Mr. Pierce. I owe you a debt of gratitude.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Not at all. That&#x27;s what friends do.&quot; Alexander kept his voice warm, collegial. &quot;There will be better opportunities. Perhaps we could discuss the tech portfolio I mentioned last month?&quot;<br/><br/>After finalizing plans to redirect Hiroshi&#x27;s investment toward one of his own companies, Alexander ended the call and checked his list. Rose Lewis had approached nine potential investors since her business began collapsing. He&#x27;d now intercepted and turned away seven of them.<br/><br/>The phone rang again, his private line. Only three people had this number.<br/><br/>&quot;Sarah. Updates?&quot;<br/><br/>His secretary&#x27;s efficient voice filled the room. &quot;Rodriguez Shipping approached Eastern Capital Partners this morning. They&#x27;re seeking hundred million in emergency financing.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander frowned slightly. Eastern Capital was one of the few major investment firms he didn&#x27;t have direct influence over.<br/><br/>&quot;Who&#x27;s handling their case?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;David Chen.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander smiled. David owed him a favor from last year&#x27;s Hong Kong deal. &quot;Connect me to him. And have the team prepare a detailed risk assessment on Rodriguez Shipping. Make sure it emphasizes their Asian routes collapse and management instability.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Already done, sir. The assessment is being delivered to Mr. Chen&#x27;s office as we speak.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Excellent.&quot; Alexander paused. &quot;Any news from Kane Industries?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Ms. Kane is scheduled to appear at the Metropolitan Museum fundraiser tonight. Our sources indicate she&#x27;ll be alone, Victoria is in Chicago for a separate engagement.&quot;<br/><br/>Interesting. Camille attending a major event without Victoria&#x27;s watchful presence. An opportunity, perhaps.<br/><br/>&quot;Send flowers to her office. White roses. No card.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes, sir. Anything else?&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander moved back to the window, mind already calculating next moves. &quot;Have we received the updated assessment on Sterling Financial&#x27;s exposure to Rodriguez Shipping debt?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes, sir. They&#x27;re significantly overextended. If Rodriguez defaults on their existing loans, Sterling could face a liquidity crisis.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Perfect. Leak that information to the Wall Street Journal&#x27;s financial desk. Anonymously, of course.&quot;<br/><br/>When Sarah signed off, Alexander remained at the window, watching night fully claim the city. In the distance, the lights of Kane Tower glowed steady and bright, Victoria&#x27;s empire, now Camille&#x27;s inheritance. Between his building and hers lay the darkening shapes of a thousand other structures, a thousand other lives, none of them aware of the chess game being played above their heads.<br/><br/>His desk phone buzzed again.<br/><br/>&quot;Mr. Pierce, William Gray from Morgan Stanley on line one. He&#x27;s asking about your interest in acquiring distressed fashion assets.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander moved to his desk, a small smile playing at his lips. So Rose had reached out to Morgan Stanley as well. Desperate times indeed.<br/><br/>&quot;William, good evening.&quot; He kept his tone pleasant, interested. &quot;What assets are we discussing?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;There&#x27;s a fashion brand facing some temporary difficulties. Strong fundamentals, excellent design team, just needs a capital infusion to weather current PR issues.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Rose Lewis&#x27;s line?&quot; Alexander asked, though he already knew the answer.<br/><br/>The pause on the other end confirmed it. &quot;Yes. You&#x27;ve heard of the situation?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I make it my business to stay informed.&quot; Alexander opened his laptop, pulling up the contingency plan he&#x27;d prepared for this exact call. &quot;Send me the prospectus. I&#x27;ll review it tonight.&quot;<br/><br/>He had no intention of investing a penny in Rose&#x27;s failing business. But expressing interest would keep other potential rescuers waiting, watching, wasting precious time while her brand sank further into crisis.<br/><br/>After ending the call, Alexander checked his other screen, where a different battle was being monitored. Three major shipping companies were circling Rodriguez Shipping, vultures sensing a dying animal. His team had quietly reached out to each one, suggesting they wait for the company&#x27;s situation to deteriorate further before making acquisition offers.<br/><br/>Why rush in, his people had suggested, when patience would yield a much lower purchase price?<br/><br/>His phone buzzed with an alert. Rodriguez Shipping stock had just hit another new low in after-hours trading. Eight percent down from yesterday&#x27;s close. Another successful day in the systematic dismantling of Stefan Rodriguez&#x27;s life.<br/><br/>Alexander should have felt only satisfaction. This was what he&#x27;d planned, helping Camille achieve her revenge while remaining invisible, repaying his debt to the woman who&#x27;d once saved him when he had nothing.<br/><br/>Instead, something uncomfortable stirred beneath his calculated exterior. Doubt. Concern. Questions about what all this destruction was doing to Camille&#x27;s soul.<br/><br/>He&#x27;d walked a similar path once. Knew the cost of revenge. The way it hollowed you out even as it satisfied your darkest hunger.<br/><br/>His private elevator pinged, doors sliding open to admit his chief security officer, Marcus.<br/><br/>&quot;The surveillance report you requested,&quot; Marcus said, placing a slim folder on Alexander&#x27;s desk. &quot;Ms. Kane&#x27;s movements for the past week.&quot;</div>
