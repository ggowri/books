        <h1>Chapter 171-2</h1>
        <div><br/>Margaret immediately moved to make room. &quot;Victoria, please sit here. It&#x27;s more comfortable.&quot;<br/><br/>The gesture wasn&#x27;t lost on Camille, her mother and Victoria had come a long way from their first icy meeting months ago. The tentative respect they&#x27;d established had clearly deepened during Camille&#x27;s abduction.<br/><br/>&quot;How is he?&quot; Victoria asked, settling into the offered chair with barely disguised relief.<br/><br/>&quot;Fighting,&quot; Alexander said. &quot;The bullet damaged major blood vessels, but they&#x27;re working to repair them.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria nodded, her gaze drifting to Camille&#x27;s bloodstained clothes. &quot;And you, child? Are you hurt?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No,&quot; Camille said. &quot;Not physically, anyway.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria reached for her hand, her grip surprisingly strong despite her weakened state. &quot;You&#x27;ve survived worse than this. We all have.&quot;<br/><br/>Richard brought coffee for everyone, the small act of kindness filling the awkward silence. Camille noticed how her father treated Victoria with a mixture of respect and gratitude, a far cry from the tension that had marked their early interactions.<br/><br/>&quot;Thank you for coming,&quot; Camille said to her parents. &quot;I know it&#x27;s not easy, being here.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Of course we came,&quot; Margaret said, her voice gentle. &quot;We&#x27;ve missed too many moments when you needed us. We won&#x27;t miss any more.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander took the seat on Camille&#x27;s other side, completing their strange circle. &quot;Stefan&#x27;s parents are trying to get a flight from Madrid. I&#x27;ve arranged for my jet to meet them.&quot;<br/><br/>A nurse pushed through the doors, carrying a clipboard. &quot;Family of Stefan Rodriguez?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes,&quot; five voices answered at once.<br/><br/>The nurse blinked, taken aback. &quot;The doctor asked me to update you. He&#x27;s stable for now. They&#x27;ve repaired the main damage, but he&#x27;s critical. The next twenty-four hours will be decisive.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille felt her knees weaken with relief. Alexander&#x27;s arm slipped around her waist again, supporting her weight.<br/><br/>&quot;Can we see him?&quot; she asked.<br/><br/>&quot;Not yet,&quot; the nurse replied. &quot;He&#x27;ll be in recovery for several hours, then intensive care. It might be morning before visitors are allowed.&quot;<br/><br/>She left them with that mixed news, Stefan alive, but barely. The strange gathering fell silent once more. Outside, the storm began to ease, the thunder growing more distant.<br/><br/>Victoria reached for Camille&#x27;s hand again. &quot;Sit down, child. You look ready to collapse.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille obeyed, sinking into the chair beside Victoria. For the first time, she truly looked at the older woman, noting the new lines of pain around her mouth, the thinness of her wrists. Victoria&#x27;s cancer battle had taken a toll.<br/><br/>&quot;You shouldn&#x27;t have come,&quot; Camille said softly. &quot;You need to rest.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s lip curled. &quot;I&#x27;ll rest when I&#x27;m dead. Which, contrary to my doctors&#x27; predictions, won&#x27;t be today.&quot;<br/><br/>Richard cleared his throat. &quot;Victoria, I hope you know how grateful we are. For everything you&#x27;ve done for Camille.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria waved her hand dismissively, but Camille caught the subtle softening around her eyes. The two families had formed an unlikely alliance during Camille&#x27;s abduction, their shared concern bridging years of misunderstanding.<br/><br/>&quot;We brought something for you,&quot; Margaret said, handing Camille a small paper bag. &quot;We found it when we were looking through old photos.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille opened the bag. Inside lay a small silver frame holding a photograph of herself at eight years old, standing proudly on the dock at Cedar Lake, fishing rod in hand. Her father&#x27;s arm was around her shoulders. Her mother smiled from the background, setting a picnic on a checkered blanket.<br/><br/>&quot;Our happy girl,&quot; Margaret whispered. &quot;Before everything changed.&quot;<br/><br/>Tears welled in Camille&#x27;s eyes again, but different this time, not the desperate sobs of earlier, but something gentler. Sorrow for what was lost, for the innocence she&#x27;d never reclaim.<br/><br/>Victoria studied the photo over Camille&#x27;s shoulder. For once, her face softened. &quot;So that&#x27;s where it comes from,&quot; she murmured. &quot;That spark I saw in you the night we met. It was there all along.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille looked up, meeting Victoria&#x27;s gaze. &quot;You saw me when I couldn&#x27;t see myself.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I recognized you,&quot; Victoria corrected. &quot;Because I&#x27;d been you, in my own way. Broken but burning still.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s hand covered Camille&#x27;s. &quot;And now here we are. All of us.&quot;<br/><br/>An unlikely family, Camille thought, looking around the circle. The parents she was slowly rebuilding a relationship with. The mentor who had given her a second chance. The man who had loved her through her darkest days.<br/><br/>And somewhere beyond those double doors, fighting for his life, the man who had once betrayed her, then given everything to save her.<br/><br/>&quot;Do you remember what I told you when we first met?&quot; Victoria asked suddenly. &quot;About pain?&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded. &quot;That pain can destroy you, or transform you. It&#x27;s your choice.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Stefan made his choice today,&quot; Victoria said. &quot;Perhaps his first truly selfless one.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;He loved you, in his way,&quot; Richard added quietly. &quot;Even when he didn&#x27;t know how to show it.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille didn&#x27;t answer. Her feelings for Stefan were too complex to untangle now, the betrayal, the pain, but also the years of shared history, and now this final sacrifice.<br/><br/>The morning would come with its own challenges. Stefan&#x27;s uncertain fate. Rose&#x27;s prosecution. Victoria&#x27;s cancer battle. The continuing journey of reconciliation with her parents.<br/><br/>But for now, in this strange moment of calm between storms, Camille felt something she hadn&#x27;t expected: peace. Not the absence of pain, but something deeper, the knowledge that whatever came next, she wouldn&#x27;t face it alone.<br/><br/>The surgery doors swung open. The doctor appeared, his face solemn but no longer grim.<br/><br/>&quot;He&#x27;s asking for you,&quot; he said, looking directly at Camille. &quot;Just a few minutes. He&#x27;s still very weak.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille rose on shaky legs. Alexander squeezed her hand before letting go.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;ll be right here,&quot; he promised.<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s eyes met hers, conveying strength without words.<br/><br/>Margaret touched her arm. &quot;Take your time, honey.&quot;<br/><br/>Richard simply nodded, his support silent but clear.<br/><br/>Surrounded by this unlikely circle of love, Camille gathered her courage. Then, with a deep breath, she walked forward to face whatever came next.<br/></div>
