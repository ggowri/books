        <h1>Chapter 165-2</h1>
        <div><br/>For a split second, Camille saw the hurt child Rose had once been, the adopted girl who never felt secure in her place, who always thought she had to fight for love.<br/><br/>Then the moment passed, and Rose&#x27;s expression hardened again. &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter now. What matters is what comes next.&quot; She pointed to the screens. &quot;Victoria first, I think. The woman who replaced your mother. Who made you her heir while I was cast aside.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No,&quot; Camille whispered, the word torn from her throat. &quot;Please, Rose. She&#x27;s ill. She&#x27;s recovering from cancer.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I know,&quot; Rose said coldly. &quot;That makes her the perfect first target. So vulnerable in that isolated lake house. So trusting of her security team.&quot; She smiled over her shoulder at Camille. &quot;I&#x27;ve been studying the layout, the routines, the weaknesses in her protection. When the time comes, it will be so easy.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille lunged forward, the chair scraping against the wooden floor as she fought against her bonds. &quot;Stop it! Stop this now!&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Why should I?&quot; Rose turned, watching Camille&#x27;s struggles with mild interest. &quot;You took everything from me. My family. My place. My future. Now I&#x27;m taking everything from you.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I never took anything from you!&quot; Camille shouted, abandoning her attempt to stay calm. &quot;You tried to kill me! They found out the truth about you!&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;THE TRUTH?&quot; Rose&#x27;s sudden scream echoed through the cabin. &quot;The truth is that they never really wanted me. The truth is that I was never good enough. The truth is that from the moment they adopted me, I was just waiting to be thrown away.&quot;<br/><br/>Her chest heaved with emotion, hands clenched at her sides. &quot;Do you know what it&#x27;s like? To never feel secure? To always be afraid that one mistake will make them send you back? To watch them love their real daughter unconditionally while you have to earn every scrap of affection?&quot;<br/><br/>Despite everything, the fear, the danger, the threats to those she loved, Camille felt a flicker of pity for her sister. &quot;Rose, that wasn&#x27;t real. It was all in your mind. They loved you. We all did.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;STOP SAYING THAT!&quot; Rose grabbed a vase from a nearby table and hurled it against the wall. It shattered, pieces scattering across the floor like her fractured words. &quot;Stop lying to me! They threw me away. They abandoned me. They chose you.&quot;<br/><br/>For the first time, Camille saw clearly the depth of Rose&#x27;s delusion, the sickness that had warped her mind over years of perceived rejection. This wasn&#x27;t just jealousy or resentment. This was something deeper, more broken.<br/><br/>&quot;Rose,&quot; she said softly, &quot;you need help. This isn&#x27;t right. This isn&#x27;t you.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You don&#x27;t know me,&quot; Rose spat. &quot;You never did.&quot; She turned back to the laptop. &quot;And now it&#x27;s too late.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille watched helplessly as Rose studied the surveillance feeds, her finger tracing Victoria&#x27;s image on the screen. &quot;Tomorrow I start with Victoria. Such a shame her cancer treatment will take a sudden turn for the worse.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Please,&quot; Camille begged, all pride forgotten. &quot;Don&#x27;t hurt her. Hurt me instead. I&#x27;m the one you want to punish.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose looked up, something cold and calculating in her eyes. &quot;Oh, I am hurting you,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;More than if I used knives or fists. I&#x27;m taking away the people you love. One by one. Forcing you to watch. Unable to save them.&quot;<br/><br/>She closed the laptop. &quot;It&#x27;s already in motion, sister dear. My plan is set. Soon Victoria Kane will suffer a tragic setback. Such a shame, after she seemed to be improving so well.&quot;<br/><br/>Tears streamed down Camille&#x27;s face now, unchecked. &quot;Rose, please. It&#x27;s not too late to stop this.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It was too late months ago,&quot; Rose replied, standing up. &quot;Too late when they chose you over me. Too late when they abandoned me for trying to make things fair. Too late when Victoria Kane saved you from that parking garage and made you her heir while I lost everything.&quot; She smiled, a terrible empty expression. &quot;Now all I can do is make things even. Take from you what you took from me.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And then what?&quot; Camille asked, desperately trying to reach whatever humanity might remain in her sister. &quot;After you&#x27;ve killed everyone I love. After you&#x27;ve broken me. What then, Rose?&quot;<br/><br/>For a moment, Rose looked confused, as if she hadn&#x27;t thought beyond her revenge. &quot;Then... then we&#x27;re even.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And will that make you happy?&quot; Camille pressed. &quot;Will that fill the emptiness inside you? The hurt? The pain?&quot;<br/><br/>Rose turned away. &quot;Stop it.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Will killing Victoria bring back our family? Will hurting Alexander erase what happened? Will destroying me heal you?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;STOP IT!&quot; Rose whirled back, her face contorted with rage and something else, uncertainty. &quot;You don&#x27;t get to question me. You don&#x27;t get to judge me. Not after everything you&#x27;ve taken.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille saw it then, the hairline crack in Rose&#x27;s certainty. The moment of doubt. She pushed harder. &quot;I never took anything from you, Rose. You destroyed it yourself. And this revenge won&#x27;t give it back.&quot;<br/><br/>For a heartbeat, Rose seemed to waver. Then her face hardened again. &quot;Nice try, sister dear. But your psychological games won&#x27;t work on me. I&#x27;ve been planning this for too long. Waiting for this moment.&quot;<br/><br/>She moved to the door. &quot;I&#x27;m going to check with my men. When I come back, we will continue.&quot; She smiled, cold and empty. &quot;Won&#x27;t that be fun? A little sister&#x27;s reunion&quot;<br/><br/>The door closed behind her, leaving Camille alone with the knowledge that Victoria was in immediate danger, that Alexander would be next, that everyone she loved had a target on their back, and she was powerless to warn them.<br/><br/>But Rose&#x27;s moment of uncertainty lingered in her mind. The crack in her sister&#x27;s armor. Small, almost invisible, but real.<br/><br/>Camille looked around the cabin, searching for anything that might help her escape. The ropes were too tight, the knots too professional. But Rose had made one mistake.<br/><br/>She had left the laptop.<br/><br/>Closed, but still there on the table. If Camille could somehow get to it, somehow open it, maybe she could send a warning. Alert Alexander. Save Victoria.<br/><br/>Straining against her bonds, Camille worked to inch the heavy chair across the floor toward the table. Each movement was agony, the ropes digging into her wrists and ankles, but the thought of Victoria in danger drove her forward.<br/><br/>Outside, she heard voices, Rose speaking to someone. She had minutes at most.<br/><br/>Desperation gave her strength. The chair legs scraped across the wooden floor as she fought to reach the table, to somehow save the people she loved before Rose destroyed them one by one.<br/><br/>And as she struggled, one thought burned in her mind: this place, this cabin where they had once been sisters, would not become the site of Rose&#x27;s final victory. Whatever it took, whatever she had to endure, She would not let Rose win. Not this time. Not ever.<br/></div>
