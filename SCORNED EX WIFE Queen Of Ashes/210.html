        <h1>Chapter 138-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 138<br/><br/>Rain pounded against the windows of Pierce Tower as Alexander pored over security reports. Three days had passed since the Phoenix Grid attacks, and the constant worry had etched new lines around his eyes. His phone buzzed. Unknown number. He almost ignored it.<br/><br/>&quot;Pierce.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I need to see you.&quot; A male voice, quiet but urgent. &quot;It&#x27;s about Camille. And Rose.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander stiffened. &quot;Who is this?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Stefan Rodriguez.&quot;<br/><br/>The name sent a surge of anger through Alexander. His grip tightened on the phone. &quot;You have nothing I want to hear.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Please,&quot; Stefan&#x27;s voice cracked. &quot;Rose has contacted people, dangerous people. Camille is in danger.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander checked his watch. &quot;The Plaza Hotel. Thirty minutes. Come alone.&quot;<br/><br/>He ended the call, his thoughts churning. Stefan Rodriguez, the man who had broken Camille&#x27;s heart, who had chosen Rose over her. His instinct screamed to ignore him. But if there was even a tiny chance Camille was in danger...<br/><br/>Alexander made another call. &quot;Double security on Ms. Kane. And run a background check on any criminal associates of Rose Lewis.&quot;<br/><br/>The Plaza&#x27;s Oak Room was nearly empty at this hour. Alexander chose a corner booth with a clear view of all entrances. He ordered nothing, his body tense as he waited.<br/><br/>Stefan arrived five minutes early, soaked from the rain. His expensive suit hung poorly on his frame, as if he&#x27;d lost weight. Dark circles shadowed his eyes.<br/><br/>&quot;Thank you for...&quot; Stefan began.<br/><br/>&quot;Sit. Talk. Make it quick.&quot; Alexander cut him off, gesturing to the opposite seat.<br/><br/>Stefan sank into the chair, running a hand through his wet hair. &quot;Rose has reached out to Anton Bessonov.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander raised an eyebrow. &quot;The Russian?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes. He has ties to organized crime in Brighton Beach. I learned about it yesterday. One of my former shipping managers still has connections in the import business. He overheard something.&quot; Stefan leaned forward, lowering his voice. &quot;Rose asked about getting weapons. Serious ones.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And why would your manager tell you this?&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan&#x27;s eyes dropped to the table. &quot;Because he knows what I did to Camille. Everyone does now. He thought...&quot; His voice faltered. &quot;He thought I might want to make things right.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander studied the man before him, looking for signs of deception. &quot;You could have called the police with this information.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And tell them what? That my ex fiance might be talking to a Russian businessman with shady connections? I have no proof. Nothing they could act on.&quot; Stefan met Alexander&#x27;s gaze directly. &quot;But I know Rose. I know how she thinks. When the bombings didn&#x27;t work, she&#x27;d escalate. Make it personal.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Why come to me? Why not go to Camille directly?&quot;<br/><br/>Pain flashed across Stefan&#x27;s face. &quot;You think she&#x27;d believe anything I said? After what I did?&quot; He shook his head. &quot;No. But she trusts you.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander remained silent, processing. The information aligned with their security team&#x27;s assessment. Rose had disappeared after the bombings. Herod Preston hadn&#x27;t been seen either.<br/><br/>&quot;What do you want, Rodriguez?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;To help.&quot; Stefan straightened in his chair. &quot;I have connections of my own. People who owe me favors. I can get information you can&#x27;t access through regular channels.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Out of the goodness of your heart?&quot; Alexander&#x27;s tone dripped with skepticism.<br/><br/>Stefan flinched. &quot;I know you won&#x27;t believe this, but I care what happens to Camille. I always did, even when...&quot; He trailed off. &quot;I made terrible choices. I can&#x27;t undo them. But I can try to protect her now.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You had your chance to protect her. You chose Rose instead.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; The simple admission hung in the air between them. &quot;I did. I was blind, selfish, easily manipulated. I&#x27;ve lost everything because of those choices. My company. My reputation. My soul.&quot; His voice broke on the last word. &quot;I&#x27;m not asking for forgiveness. I&#x27;m asking for a chance to do one decent thing.&quot;<br/><br/>Rain hammered against the windows, filling the silence that followed. Alexander studied the broken man before him. His instinct was to throw him out, to protect Camille from even the memory of this man. But his practical side recognized the potential value of Stefan&#x27;s information.<br/><br/>&quot;If.... and it&#x27;s a big if..... we use your help, it would be on my terms,&quot; Alexander said finally. &quot;You don&#x27;t approach Camille. You don&#x27;t call her. Everything goes through me.&quot;<br/><br/>Relief flooded Stefan&#x27;s face. &quot;Agreed. Whatever you need.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ll need names. Contacts. Every detail you can get on Bessonov&#x27;s operation.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ll get it.&quot; Stefan produced a small flash drive from his pocket. &quot;This has everything I know so far. Security footage from one of Bessonov&#x27;s clubs showing Rose entering three days ago. Cell phone records showing calls between them.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander took the drive, surprised. &quot;How did you get this?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Like I said, people owe me favors. And money still opens doors, even when your name is mud.&quot; A ghost of Stefan&#x27;s former confidence flickered across his face.<br/><br/>&quot;If this checks out, I&#x27;ll be in touch.&quot; Alexander stood, signaling the end of the meeting.<br/><br/>&quot;Pierce,&quot; Stefan called as Alexander turned to leave. &quot;She deserves happiness. With you. I see that now.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander said nothing, pocketing the drive as he walked away.<br/><br/>*** ***<br/><br/>Two hours later, Alexander stood in Camille&#x27;s office at Kane Industries, the contents of Stefan&#x27;s drive displayed on her screen. She stared at the image of Rose entering Bessonov&#x27;s club, her face unnaturally still.<br/><br/>&quot;Where did you get this?&quot; she asked, her voice carefully controlled.<br/><br/>Alexander hesitated before answering. &quot;Stefan Rodriguez brought it to me.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille&#x27;s head snapped up, shock washing over her features. &quot;Stefan? Why would he....&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;He&#x27;s worried about you.&quot; Alexander moved closer, resting his hands lightly on her shoulders. &quot;He came to me because he didn&#x27;t think you&#x27;d believe him directly.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;He&#x27;s right about that.&quot; Bitterness edged her words. She turned back to the screen, studying Rose&#x27;s face. &quot;So she&#x27;s working with Bessonov now. After everything Victoria did to expose him.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;There&#x27;s more.&quot; Alexander swiped to the next file. &quot;Phone records showing multiple calls. And this...&quot; A document appeared, a transaction record. &quot;A withdrawal of half a million dollars from an offshore account linked to Rose, the day before she met with Bessonov.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;She&#x27;s buying something. Or someone.&quot; Camille&#x27;s fingers tightened on the edge of her desk. &quot;What did Stefan want in return for this information?&quot;</div>
