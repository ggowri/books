        <h1>Chapter 144</h1>
        <div><p>Chapter 144<br/><br/>Camille stood at the window of her office, a cup of coffee cooling in her hands as she watched the city below. The Phoenix Grid had fully recovered from the bombings, with the repairs finished ahead of schedule. In two days, Kane Industries would host its annual charity gala, celebrating both the Grid&#x27;s success and raising money for the children&#x27;s hospital. Everything was going according to plan.<br/><br/>Until Alexander Pierce walked in, his face grim.<br/><br/>&quot;We need to talk,&quot; he said, closing the door behind him.<br/><br/>Something in his voice made Camille&#x27;s stomach tighten. She set down her coffee cup. &quot;What happened?&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander loosened his tie, a gesture he only made when upset. &quot;Herod Preston was shot three times in a motel room yesterday. He&#x27;d called the FBI to turn himself in, but before they got there, someone tried to kill him.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Rose,&quot; Camille said immediately. It wasn&#x27;t a question.<br/><br/>Alexander nodded. &quot;The motel room was registered under her name. She escaped through the bathroom window. Police are still looking for her.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille sank into her chair, trying to process this news. &quot;Is Preston dead?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No. But it&#x27;s close. He&#x27;s in intensive care, heavily guarded.&quot; Alexander sat on the edge of her desk. &quot;The FBI thinks Rose shot him to keep him from talking. He was about to tell them everything.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;About her involvement in the bombings.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille stared at her hands, noticing they were perfectly steady despite the storm inside her. Three years ago, news of Rose&#x27;s latest violence would have shaken her. Now it just confirmed what she already knew, her sister was dangerous, desperate, and would stop at nothing.<br/><br/>&quot;So Rose is on the run,&quot; Camille said. &quot;With the FBI hunting her.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes. But that makes her more dangerous, not less.&quot; Alexander reached for Camille&#x27;s hand. &quot;She has nothing left to lose now.&quot;<br/><br/>Before Camille could respond, the door opened again. Victoria Kane swept in, her face pale but determined. Despite her recent surgery, she moved with purpose, though Camille noticed she leaned slightly on her cane.<br/><br/>&quot;You&#x27;ve told her?&quot; Victoria asked Alexander.<br/><br/>&quot;Just now,&quot; he confirmed.<br/><br/>Victoria turned to Camille. &quot;We need to postpone the charity gala.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What? No.&quot; Camille stood. &quot;Everything is ready. The donors are confirmed. The hospital is counting on us.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Rose is out there,&quot; Victoria said sharply. &quot;She&#x27;s armed. She&#x27;s desperate. And she wants to destroy you.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;She&#x27;s always wanted to destroy me,&quot; Camille replied, her voice steady. &quot;That hasn&#x27;t changed.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What&#x27;s changed is that she&#x27;s shot a man three times and is now running from the FBI,&quot; Victoria countered. &quot;She&#x27;s crossed a line, Camille. She&#x27;s proven she&#x27;s willing to kill.&quot;<br/><br/>The three of them fell silent, the weight of Victoria&#x27;s words hanging in the air. Camille moved back to the window, looking out at the city she&#x27;d helped rebuild after Rose&#x27;s attacks. Her city now.<br/><br/>&quot;I won&#x27;t hide,&quot; she said finally. &quot;I won&#x27;t cancel the gala because I&#x27;m afraid of Rose.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria sighed, the sound heavy with frustration. &quot;This isn&#x27;t about fear. It&#x27;s about common sense. Basic safety.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s about sending a message,&quot; Camille insisted, turning to face her mentor. &quot;If we cancel the gala, Rose wins. She&#x27;ll know she can disrupt our lives, make us run and hide, anytime she wants.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Better disrupted than dead,&quot; Victoria said bluntly.<br/><br/>Alexander watched them both, his face thoughtful. &quot;What if we went ahead with the gala, but with increased security? My team plus Kane Industries security. The FBI might even provide protection if we tell them Rose might appear.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria shook her head. &quot;Too risky. Rose knows this event is important to Camille. She&#x27;ll see it as the perfect opportunity to strike.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Good,&quot; Camille said, surprising them both. &quot;Let her come.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Camille...&quot; Victoria began, alarm clear in her voice.<br/><br/>&quot;No, listen.&quot; Camille moved closer, her mind racing ahead. &quot;Rose is unpredictable when she&#x27;s hiding, when she can plan her attacks in secret. But if she comes to the gala, we&#x27;ll be ready. We&#x27;ll know where she is, what she&#x27;s doing.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You want to use the gala as bait,&quot; Alexander realized, his expression torn between admiration and concern.<br/><br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; Camille&#x27;s eyes burned with determination. &quot;We find her before she finds us. End this once and for all.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria stared at her adopted daughter, seeing not the broken woman she&#x27;d rescued from a parking garage, but someone new. Someone who had been forged in fire and emerged stronger. Part of her felt proud. Another part felt afraid.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s too dangerous,&quot; Victoria insisted. &quot;Rose has already tried to kill Herod. She won&#x27;t hesitate to come after you.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m not Herod,&quot; Camille said quietly. &quot;I&#x27;ve never underestimated Rose. I know exactly what she&#x27;s capable of.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander stood, moving to Camille&#x27;s side. &quot;If we do this, we do it my way. Every guest checked and rechecked. Security at every entrance. Plainclothes guards throughout the event.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And you stay by my side the entire night,&quot; Camille added, taking his hand. &quot;No wandering off to charm donors on your own.&quot;<br/><br/>He smiled slightly. &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t dream of it.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria watched them, seeing their determination, their unity. She had taught Camille to face her enemies, to show strength instead of weakness. Now her student was putting those lessons into practice, despite Victoria&#x27;s own fears.<br/><br/>&quot;You&#x27;re both insane,&quot; Victoria said finally. &quot;But if you&#x27;re determined to do this, we&#x27;ll need a detailed security plan. One that assumes Rose will find a way in no matter what we do.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Already working on it,&quot; Alexander assured her. &quot;I&#x27;ll have a draft by this afternoon.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria nodded, then focused on Camille. &quot;You understand what you&#x27;re risking, yes? Rose isn&#x27;t just angry anymore. She&#x27;s cornered. Desperate. The most dangerous she&#x27;s ever been.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I understand,&quot; Camille said, her voice soft but firm. &quot;But I&#x27;m not the woman she tried to destroy in that parking garage. I&#x27;m not afraid of her anymore.&quot;<br/><br/>Something flickered across Victoria&#x27;s face, pride mixed with worry. &quot;Just remember that not being afraid doesn&#x27;t make you bulletproof.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s why we have security,&quot; Camille replied with a small smile.<br/><br/>Victoria didn&#x27;t return the smile. &quot;I&#x27;ll make some calls. Add my own resources to Pierce&#x27;s team.&quot; She turned to leave, then paused at the door. &quot;Camille, promise me one thing.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That you&#x27;ll listen to your security team. No heroics. No unnecessary risks. Rose isn&#x27;t worth dying for.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded solemnly. &quot;I promise.&quot;<br/><br/>After Victoria left, Alexander pulled Camille into his arms. &quot;Are you sure about this? Really sure?&quot;<br/><br/>She rested her head against his chest, listening to his heartbeat. &quot;Yes. I&#x27;m tired of waiting for Rose to attack. Tired of wondering where she&#x27;ll strike next.&quot; She looked up at him, her eyes clear. &quot;It&#x27;s time to end this. On my terms, not hers.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander brushed a strand of hair from her face. &quot;I&#x27;ll keep you safe. No matter what.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I know.&quot; Camille&#x27;s voice was firm, confident. &quot;That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not afraid. We face her together.&quot;<br/><br/>He kissed her gently. &quot;Together.&quot;<br/><br/>As Alexander left to begin working on the security plans, Camille returned to the window. The city stretched before her, glittering in the afternoon sun. From this height, the people below looked tiny, fragile. Once, she had felt that way, small and breakable in a world too big and harsh. Now she stood tall, unafraid.<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s voice came through on the intercom. &quot;Camille, can you come to my office? The security team is here.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;On my way,&quot; she replied.<br/><br/>Camille took one last look at the view from her window. She thought of how far she had come from that night in the parking garage. How much she had built from the ashes of her old life. The Phoenix Grid. Her position at Kane Industries. Her relationship with Alexander. Her reconciliation with her parents.<br/><br/>Rose had tried to take everything from her, again and again. But each time, Camille had emerged stronger.<br/><br/>&quot;Not this time, Rose,&quot; she whispered to herself. &quot;This time, I&#x27;m ready for you.&quot;<br/><br/>She straightened her shoulders and headed to Victoria&#x27;s office, where Alexander waited with the security team. They had a gala to prepare for. And this time, Camille would be the one setting the trap, not walking into one.<br/><br/>The door closed behind her with a soft click of finality.<br/><br/>The hunt was about to begin.</p></div>
