        <h1>Chapter 142-2</h1>
        <div><br/>Her expression hardened. &quot;I didn&#x27;t.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Stop lying,&quot; Herod said, surprising himself with how calm he felt. &quot;Just tell me the truth. Once. Was I ever anything to you besides a useful tool?&quot;<br/><br/>Something flickered in Rose&#x27;s eyes, hesitation, perhaps, or calculation. Then her face softened, and she sat beside him, taking his hand.<br/><br/>&quot;Of course you were,&quot; she said, her voice gentle. &quot;You still are. I care about you, Herod. That&#x27;s why I need you to come with me now. Before it&#x27;s too late.&quot;<br/><br/>The performance was flawless, the concerned lover, the devoted partner. If he hadn&#x27;t already seen behind her mask, he might have believed her.<br/><br/>&quot;You&#x27;re very good,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;I almost believe you.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s grip on his hand tightened painfully. &quot;We need to go. Now.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod pulled his hand away and stood. &quot;I&#x27;m done running, Rose. I&#x27;m done being your puppet.&quot;<br/><br/>Anger flashed across her face. &quot;If you turn yourself in, they&#x27;ll make you tell them everything. I&#x27;ll be implicated.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Isn&#x27;t that what you&#x27;re afraid of?&quot; Herod asked. &quot;That I&#x27;ll tell them the truth? That the bombings were your idea? That you planned everything?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;They&#x27;ll never believe you,&quot; Rose said, but uncertainty tinged her voice. &quot;You&#x27;re the one with the grudge against Victoria Kane. You&#x27;re the one with the fingerprints at the bomb sites. You&#x27;re the one with the plans in your apartment.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Plans you put there,&quot; Herod said. &quot;But you made one mistake.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What mistake?&quot; Rose demanded.<br/><br/>&quot;You got greedy. The fake journals, the blueprints, it was too much. Too perfect. It looks staged.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s face paled slightly. &quot;You&#x27;re delusional.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Am I?&quot; Herod walked to his jacket and pulled something from the pocket. A small digital recorder. &quot;I&#x27;ve been recording our conversations, Rose. For days now. Ever since I suspected you were setting me up.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose lunged for the recorder, but Herod held it out of reach. &quot;It&#x27;s too late. I&#x27;ve already made copies. Sent them to people who will know what to do with them if anything happens to me.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You&#x27;re lying,&quot; Rose hissed, but doubt showed in her eyes.<br/><br/>&quot;Maybe.&quot; Herod pocketed the recorder. &quot;But can you risk it?&quot;<br/><br/>They stood facing each other, the air thick with tension. In Rose&#x27;s eyes, Herod saw something he&#x27;d never seen before, fear. Real fear.<br/><br/>&quot;What are you going to do?&quot; she asked finally.<br/><br/>&quot;What Charles would have wanted me to do.&quot; Herod picked up his phone from the nightstand. &quot;Turn myself in. Tell them everything. Take responsibility for my part in this madness.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;They&#x27;ll lock you up forever,&quot; Rose warned, a hint of desperation in her voice.<br/><br/>&quot;Probably,&quot; Herod agreed. &quot;But at least I&#x27;ll be able to look at myself in the mirror again.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose watched him, her mind visibly racing. Then she smiled, that slow, confident smile that had once made his heart race. Now it just made him sad.<br/><br/>&quot;You won&#x27;t do it,&quot; she said. &quot;You&#x27;re too scared. Too weak. That&#x27;s why I had to plan everything. Why I had to push you to act.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod shook his head. &quot;You&#x27;re wrong. I was weak when I let you manipulate me. When I helped you hurt innocent people. I&#x27;m finding my strength now.&quot;<br/><br/>He dialed a number on his phone. Rose watched, her confidence faltering.<br/><br/>&quot;Who are you calling?&quot; she demanded.<br/><br/>&quot;The FBI.&quot; Herod held her gaze as he raised the phone to his ear. &quot;It&#x27;s time to end this.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose grabbed her bag and rushed to the door. &quot;You&#x27;re making a terrible mistake.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No,&quot; Herod said quietly. &quot;I already made my mistakes. Now I&#x27;m trying to fix them.&quot;<br/><br/>As Rose flung open the door, Herod spoke into the phone. &quot;My name is Herod Preston. I want to turn myself in. But first, I need to tell you about Rose Lewis.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose froze in the doorway, hatred burning in her eyes. &quot;You&#x27;ll regret this,&quot; she hissed.<br/><br/>&quot;I already regret so much,&quot; Herod said. &quot;But not this.&quot;<br/><br/>The door slammed behind her. Through the thin curtains, Herod watched Rose run across the parking lot, her figure growing smaller as she disappeared into the distance.<br/><br/>On the phone, a voice asked for his location. Herod gave it, then sat heavily on the bed.<br/><br/>&quot;Sir? Are you still there?&quot; the voice asked.<br/><br/>&quot;Yes,&quot; Herod said, a strange peace settling over him. &quot;I&#x27;m ready.&quot;<br/><br/>As he waited for them to arrive, Herod thought of his brother Charles. Of his gentle smile. His kindness. His integrity.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m sorry, Charles,&quot; he whispered to the empty room. &quot;For everything. But I&#x27;m trying to make it right.&quot;<br/><br/>Outside, sirens wailed in the distance, growing louder. Coming for him. Coming to end one chapter of his life and begin another, one of punishment, of atonement.<br/><br/>Herod closed his eyes, picturing his brother&#x27;s face. For the first time in years, he didn&#x27;t see disappointment there. Just the gentle understanding Charles had always shown him, even when he didn&#x27;t deserve it.<br/><br/>The sirens grew louder. Closer.<br/><br/>Herod opened his eyes and stood, straightening his shoulders.<br/><br/>It was time to face what he had done.<br/></div>
