        <h1>Chapter 114-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 114<br/><br/>The hospital café sat empty at 2 AM, its harsh fluorescent lights casting an unnatural glow across the plastic tables. Camille stared into her untouched coffee, watching ripples form each time she trembled. Outside, rain pattered against the windows, blurring the city lights into smears of color.<br/><br/>Alexander slid into the seat across from her, setting down two fresh cups. The scent of strong espresso cut through the antiseptic hospital smell.<br/><br/>&quot;You haven&#x27;t slept,&quot; he said. Not a question.<br/><br/>Camille shook her head. She hadn&#x27;t changed clothes either, still wearing the navy suit from her meeting with Victoria&#x27;s lawyer twelve hours ago. The folder of handwritten notes sat on the table between them, untouched. She couldn&#x27;t bring herself to read Victoria&#x27;s words yet.<br/><br/>&quot;They&#x27;re prepping her for surgery now,&quot; she said, her voice raw from hours of silence. &quot;Four hours, they said. Maybe five.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander nodded, watching her face. His own showed signs of fatigue, the shadows beneath his eyes, the slight stubble along his jaw, but he remained alert, steady. A port in the storm.<br/><br/>&quot;When I was seven,&quot; Camille said suddenly, &quot;I broke my arm falling from a tree. My father was away on business. My mother sat with me in the emergency room all night, holding my good hand. I remember feeling so safe, knowing she wouldn&#x27;t leave me.&quot;<br/><br/>She looked up from her coffee. &quot;When I told my parents about Rose and Stefan&#x27;s betrayal, my mother told me I was lying. She chose Rose. She always chose Rose.&quot;<br/><br/>The memory still stung, but distantly now, like an old wound that ached before rain.<br/><br/>&quot;Victoria chose me,&quot; she whispered. &quot;When no one else did.&quot;<br/><br/>The admission hung in the air between them. Camille had never voiced it before—the depth of what Victoria meant to her. Their relationship had always been defined by other terms: mentor and protégé, benefactor and recipient, teacher and student. Never mother and daughter. Not out loud.<br/><br/>Alexander reached across the table, his hand covering hers. &quot;She chose you for a reason, Camille. She saw something in you worth investing in, worth protecting. Worth loving.&quot;<br/><br/>Loving. The word struck Camille like a physical blow. Victoria Kane was not a woman who spoke of love. She spoke of excellence, of potential, of strength. But in her actions—taking in a battered woman with nothing to offer, reshaping her, defending her, and now naming her heir to everything she had built—wasn&#x27;t that its own language of love?<br/><br/>&quot;I can&#x27;t lose her,&quot; Camille said, the words breaking free after hours of containment. &quot;Not now. Not when I&#x27;ve just realized...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Realized what?&quot; Alexander asked gently.<br/><br/>Camille gripped her coffee cup so hard her knuckles whitened. &quot;That she&#x27;s my mother now. Not by blood, but by... by everything that matters.&quot;<br/><br/>Her voice cracked. &quot;My entire life, I wanted my parents to be proud of me. To see me. Really see me. They never did.&quot; She drew a shaky breath. &quot;Victoria saw me from the beginning. The real me, beneath the perfect daughter, beneath the devoted wife, beneath the victim. She saw who I could become.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s hand tightened on hers. &quot;Tell me what you&#x27;re afraid of.&quot;<br/><br/>The directness of his question broke something inside her. The careful wall she had constructed over the past two days crumbled.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m afraid the surgery won&#x27;t work,&quot; she whispered. &quot;I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll lose her. I&#x27;m afraid of walking into that boardroom as the controlling shareholder of Kane Industries and failing. I&#x27;m afraid Rose and Herod will win because I wasn&#x27;t strong enough.&quot;<br/><br/>She looked into Alexander&#x27;s eyes, her own burning with unshed tears. &quot;But mostly, I&#x27;m afraid she&#x27;ll never know. That I never told her what she means to me. That she gave me more than revenge, more than power. She gave me back myself.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander moved from his chair, kneeling beside her. The gesture—so unexpected from this powerful man—unlocked the tears she had been holding back. They spilled down her cheeks, hot and unstoppable.<br/><br/>&quot;Then tell her,&quot; he said simply. &quot;When she wakes up from surgery, tell her.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille shook her head. &quot;Victoria doesn&#x27;t want emotional displays. She values control, discipline.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s what she shows the world,&quot; Alexander countered. &quot;But she chose you, Camille. Not a business partner, not a protégé. She chose you, named you her daughter in every way that matters. That wasn&#x27;t a business decision.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille closed her eyes, remembering Victoria&#x27;s rare moments of vulnerability. The night she had taken Camille to Sophia&#x27;s grave. The day she had given Camille her daughter&#x27;s silver phoenix pendant. The quiet pride in her eyes when Camille had successfully navigated her first board meeting. Small cracks in the armor of the formidable Victoria Kane, glimpses of the woman beneath.<br/><br/>&quot;What if she doesn&#x27;t wake up?&quot; The question emerged as barely a whisper, giving voice to her deepest fear.<br/><br/>Alexander stood, pulling Camille to her feet and into his arms. She stiffened at first—physical comfort was not something she had allowed herself since her transformation began—then melted against him, burying her face in the solid warmth of his shoulder.</div>
