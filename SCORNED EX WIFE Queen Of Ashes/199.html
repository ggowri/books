        <h1>Chapter 131</h1>
        <div><p>Chapter 131<br/><br/>The Kane Industries tower gleamed like a diamond against the night sky, every window ablaze with light. Inside the grand ballroom on the fortieth floor, crystal chandeliers cast golden reflections across the sea of New York&#x27;s elite who had gathered for the gala celebrating the Phoenix Grid launch. Tomorrow, the city&#x27;s power system would change forever.<br/><br/>Camille stood at the entrance, her midnight blue gown catching the light with each breath. The dress hugged her curves before flaring at her knees in a subtle reminder of the phoenix that had become her symbol. At her side, Alexander looked equally striking in a perfectly tailored tuxedo, his hand resting lightly against the small of her back.<br/><br/>&quot;Ready?&quot; he murmured, his lips close to her ear.<br/><br/>She nodded, straightening her shoulders as they stepped into the room together. A hush fell over the crowd, followed by enthusiastic applause. Cameras flashed, capturing the moment for tomorrow&#x27;s society pages.<br/><br/>&quot;They love you,&quot; Alexander said as they moved through the crowd, accepting congratulations from every side.<br/><br/>&quot;They love what we represent,&quot; Camille corrected. &quot;Success. Power. The future.&quot;<br/><br/>The mayor approached, hand extended. &quot;Ms. Kane, Mr. Pierce, the guests of honor! New York can&#x27;t thank you enough for what you&#x27;ve accomplished with the Phoenix Grid.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Victoria Kane&#x27;s vision made it possible,&quot; Camille replied smoothly, the practiced response coming easily.<br/><br/>&quot;But you and Mr. Pierce made it reality,&quot; the mayor insisted. &quot;Everyone&#x27;s talking about you two, the power couple who revolutionized how this city runs. Your relationship has become a symbol of what partnerships can achieve!&quot;<br/><br/>More people crowded around them, eager to claim a moment with the night&#x27;s stars. Camille smiled and responded to their praise with gracious nods, while keeping track of the room&#x27;s key players. The governor by the east windows. The city council near the bar. International investors at the central tables. Everyone who mattered had come to witness history in the making.<br/><br/>Victoria appeared at their side, resplendent in silver that matched her hair. &quot;The governor wants to speak with you both,&quot; she said, skillfully extracting them from the admiring crowd.<br/><br/>As they crossed the room, Camille caught whispers following in their wake.<br/><br/>&quot;They make such a handsome couple...&quot;<br/>&quot;...their romance began during the Grid development...&quot;<br/>&quot;...transformed Kane Industries and pierce enterprises in less than few months.&quot;<br/><br/>The night continued in a whirl of significant conversations and strategic networking. Though champagne flowed freely, Camille sipped sparingly. Tomorrow required absolute clarity. Rose and Herod remained at large, their final move still unknown.<br/><br/>At midnight, Victoria tapped a crystal glass, bringing the room to attention. &quot;Tomorrow,&quot; she began, her voice carrying effortlessly, &quot;we change New York forever with the activation of the Phoenix Grid.&quot;<br/><br/>She gestured to Camille and Alexander, who moved forward to stand beside her. &quot;This revolutionary system exists because of the extraordinary partnership between Kane Industries and Pierce Enterprises, personified by my protégée, Camille Kane, and Alexander Pierce.&quot;<br/><br/>More applause, louder now as the crowd&#x27;s enthusiasm was fueled by hours of expensive champagne. Victoria waited for silence before continuing.<br/><br/>&quot;Their vision, determination, and brilliant collaboration has created something none thought possible, clean, efficient power for every home and business in this city.&quot; She raised her glass. &quot;To Camille and Alexander, New York&#x27;s most formidable team, in business and in life!&quot;<br/><br/>The crowd echoed the toast, glasses raised. Camille felt Alexander&#x27;s hand find hers, their fingers intertwining as hundreds of eyes focused on them. For this moment, they were the center of New York&#x27;s universe, celebrated and admired by those who controlled the city&#x27;s fate.<br/><br/>** **<br/><br/>Exactly four blocks away, in an empty office with a direct view of the Kane Industries tower, Rose pressed binoculars to her eyes. The gala&#x27;s glamour was visible even at this distance, the glittering crowd, the flashing cameras, the unmistakable figure of her sister accepting adulation that should have been hers.<br/><br/>&quot;Look at them,&quot; she hissed, jealousy burning like acid in her stomach. &quot;Celebrating as if they&#x27;ve already won.&quot;<br/><br/>Beside her, Herod studied the building through a high-powered scope. &quot;Security is even tighter than we anticipated. Armed guards at every entrance. ID checks. Metal detectors.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I don&#x27;t care,&quot; Rose snapped. &quot;We&#x27;re getting in tomorrow, no matter what it takes.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod lowered the scope, turning to look at her. In the dim light of the empty office, her face was transformed by hatred, her beauty hardened into something almost unrecognizable.<br/><br/>&quot;Our original plan won&#x27;t work,&quot; he said carefully. &quot;They&#x27;ve discovered Walsh. They&#x27;ve fixed the Grid vulnerabilities. We need to reconsider our approach.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose didn&#x27;t seem to hear him, the binoculars still pressed to her eyes. &quot;She&#x27;s wearing blue. Always trying to look regal, superior. And Pierce hasn&#x27;t left her side all night. The way everyone fawns over them as the perfect couple. It&#x27;s disgusting.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Rose.&quot; Herod&#x27;s voice sharpened. &quot;We need to focus. The ceremony starts at noon tomorrow. We have less than twelve hours to finalize our new plan.&quot;<br/><br/>She finally lowered the binoculars, but her gaze remained fixed on the distant tower. &quot;Everything she has should have been mine. The company. The fame. Victoria&#x27;s approval.&quot; Her fingers tightened around the binoculars until her knuckles turned white. &quot;I was the one who worked harder, who sacrificed more. I was the one who deserved it all.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And you&#x27;ll get your revenge,&quot; Herod assured her, trying to redirect her focus. &quot;But not with our original plan. We need to adapt.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose turned to the table where their equipment was spread out, floor plans of Kane Industries, security rotations, the ceremonial schedule for tomorrow&#x27;s launch. But her mind remained across those four blocks, in the ballroom where Camille basked in admiration that Rose believed rightfully belonged to her.<br/><br/>&quot;They think they&#x27;ve won,&quot; she said, her voice dropping to a whisper. &quot;They think they&#x27;ve outsmarted us.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;They have anticipated our moves,&quot; Herod admitted. &quot;But they don&#x27;t know everything. We still have options.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose picked up a photo of Camille, taken at a press conference announcing the Grid completion. &quot;Look at her. So confident. So secure in her perfect new life with her perfect new boyfriend.&quot; Her nail scraped across Camille&#x27;s face, leaving a thin scratch on the glossy surface. &quot;By this time tomorrow, she&#x27;ll have nothing. No Grid. No company. No future with Alexander Pierce.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod watched her with growing concern. Rose&#x27;s obsession had intensified beyond his control, beyond reason. What had begun as a strategic partnership to acquire Kane Industries had evolved into something more primal, more dangerous.<br/><br/>&quot;The best approach now is subtlety,&quot; he suggested, keeping his voice even. &quot;A targeted disruption during the ceremony. Something that causes chaos without revealing our presence.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s laugh held no humor. &quot;Subtlety? We&#x27;re past that, Herod. They&#x27;ve pushed us into a corner. Now they&#x27;ll discover what happens when we push back.&quot;<br/><br/>She moved to another bag, unzipping it to reveal a sophisticated electronic device Herod hadn&#x27;t seen before.<br/><br/>&quot;What is that?&quot; he asked.<br/><br/>&quot;Plan B,&quot; Rose replied calmly. &quot;A signal jammer powerful enough to disrupt the entire Grid activation ceremony. When Victoria tries to throw the switch tomorrow, nothing will happen. Their precious Grid will fail spectacularly in front of the entire world.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod studied the device. &quot;That won&#x27;t cause permanent damage to the Grid. It&#x27;s just a temporary embarrassment.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The damage to their reputations will be permanent,&quot; Rose countered. &quot;Kane Industries stock will plummet. The city will question whether the Grid is safe. Government contracts will be reconsidered.&quot; She smiled coldly. &quot;And while everyone is focused on the Grid&#x27;s failure, we&#x27;ll implement the rest of our plan.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Which is?&quot; Herod asked, suddenly wary of where her mind was going.<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s eyes gleamed in the darkness. &quot;Victoria Kane destroyed your family&#x27;s legacy. Tomorrow, we&#x27;ll destroy hers, not just the Grid, but her company, her reputation, and most importantly, her precious protégée.&quot;<br/><br/>Through the window, the Kane Industries tower continued to shine, the celebration inside reaching its peak. Herod looked from the distant building to Rose&#x27;s focused form, recognition dawning that he had allied himself with someone whose hatred ran deeper than he had ever understood.<br/><br/>&quot;This isn&#x27;t just about business for you anymore, is it?&quot; he asked quietly. &quot;It&#x27;s not even about revenge.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s about justice,&quot; Rose replied, her voice frighteningly calm. &quot;For years I watched Camille get everything while I got nothing. Tomorrow, the scales finally balance.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod felt a chill as he heard the utter conviction in her voice. &quot;Rose, what exactly are you planning beyond the signal jammer?&quot;<br/><br/>She looked up at him, her eyes reflecting the distant lights of the tower where her sister celebrated. &quot;Do you really want to know? Or would you prefer plausible deniability?&quot;<br/><br/>The question hung between them, weighted with implications. Across those four city blocks, champagne glasses clinked in celebration of tomorrow&#x27;s triumph. Here, in the shadows, Rose awaited his answer.<br/><br/>Herod stood at the crossroads, watching the point of no return approach with terrifying speed.</p></div>
