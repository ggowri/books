        <h1>Chapter 104-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 104<br/><br/>The basement level of Kane Industries glowed with harsh fluorescent light at two in the morning. While most of the building sat dark and empty, the engineering lab hummed with tense activity. Sheets of blueprints covered every surface. Monitors displayed complex circuit diagrams and safety protocols. The air smelled of coffee and stress.<br/><br/>Hannah Zhao stood at the center of it all, hair pulled back in a messy bun, dark circles under her eyes. She hadn&#x27;t gone home in thirty-six hours. Neither had the six engineers she&#x27;d personally selected for this shadow team, the only people besides Camille, Alexander, and Victoria who knew about the sabotage of the Phoenix Grid.<br/><br/>&quot;Li, what&#x27;s the status on the junction box rewiring?&quot; Hannah asked, not looking up from the circuit board she was examining through a magnifying glass.<br/><br/>Li, a thin man with wire-rimmed glasses, didn&#x27;t pause his typing. &quot;Schematics complete. I&#x27;ve isolated all fourteen tampered triggers and recalibrated them to the correct specs.&quot;<br/><br/>Hannah nodded, marking something on her tablet. &quot;Good. Park, how about the emergency shutdown protocol?&quot;<br/><br/>Across the room, a woman with short-cropped hair shook her head. &quot;It&#x27;s worse than we thought. They didn&#x27;t just modify the temperature sensors. They rigged the entire backup system to fail simultaneously instead of in sequence.&quot;<br/><br/>Hannah&#x27;s stomach tightened. The sabotage grew more alarming the deeper they dug. This wasn&#x27;t just an attempt to cause the Grid to fail, it was designed to make it fail catastrophically, with maximum damage and danger.<br/><br/>A voice spoke from the doorway. &quot;How bad is it?&quot;<br/><br/>Hannah turned to see Camille standing there. Despite the late hour, she looked perfectly put together in a tailored pantsuit, though exhaustion shadowed her eyes.<br/><br/>&quot;Ms. Kane.&quot; Hannah straightened. &quot;We didn&#x27;t expect you tonight.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I couldn&#x27;t sleep.&quot; Camille crossed to the main workstation. &quot;Show me what you&#x27;ve found.&quot;<br/><br/>Hannah pulled up the master diagram on the main screen. Red marks highlighted each sabotaged component, there were dozens, spread throughout the Grid&#x27;s main systems.<br/><br/>&quot;They were... thorough,&quot; Hannah said, trying to keep her voice steady. &quot;Every critical safety system has been compromised in some way. Temperature sensors set too high. Circuit breakers modified to allow power surges. Backup systems designed to fail.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille&#x27;s face remained composed, but Hannah saw her hands clench at her sides. &quot;And the result?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;If the Grid went online with these modifications...&quot; Hannah paused, the words sticking in her throat. &quot;The main junction boxes would overheat within seventy-two hours. The safety systems would report everything functioning normally even as temperatures reached dangerous levels. When the system finally failed, it would trigger a cascading power surge through the entire grid.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Explosions?&quot; Camille asked softly.<br/><br/>Hannah nodded. &quot;Multiple sites. Simultaneous. The downtown power grid would go down completely. And the public record would show that Kane Industries knowingly implemented a flawed system.&quot;<br/><br/>A muscle twitched in Camille&#x27;s jaw, the only sign of the anger she must be feeling.<br/><br/>&quot;But we&#x27;re fixing it,&quot; Hannah added quickly. &quot;We&#x27;ve already corrected the blueprint modifications. We&#x27;re now implementing physical changes to counteract any hardware that&#x27;s already been installed according to the sabotaged plans.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And no one outside this room knows what we&#x27;re doing?&quot; Camille surveyed the small team.<br/><br/>&quot;No one.&quot; Hannah lowered her voice. &quot;We&#x27;re logging all our work as routine pre-launch inspections. The construction teams think we&#x27;re just being extra thorough.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille&#x27;s gaze swept over the exhausted engineers. &quot;You&#x27;re all taking an enormous risk. Rose and her partner have already shown they&#x27;re willing to hurt people to get what they want.&quot;<br/><br/>The room fell silent. Until now, no one had openly acknowledged the danger they might be in.<br/><br/>&quot;We believe in the Phoenix Grid,&quot; Hannah said after a moment. &quot;And we believe in you, Ms. Kane.&quot;<br/><br/>Something flickered across Camille&#x27;s face, surprise, perhaps, or a deeper emotion Hannah couldn&#x27;t name. She turned away quickly, examining one of the circuit boards.<br/><br/>&quot;How soon can the corrections be completed?&quot; Camille asked.<br/><br/>Hannah checked her timeline. &quot;Three more nights, if we work straight through. We need to replace forty-three physical components that have already been installed.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And what about James Walsh?&quot; Camille asked, referring to the electrician they&#x27;d identified as Rose&#x27;s mole.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;re... handling him carefully.&quot; Hannah pulled up a security feed on her tablet, showing a middle-aged man with thinning ginger hair installing components at one of the secondary Grid sites. &quot;We&#x27;ve kept him assigned to non-critical systems. Everything he installs gets quietly removed and replaced after his shift ends.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded, satisfaction briefly crossing her features. &quot;Good. And he&#x27;s still reporting to Rose?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;According to Mr. Pierce&#x27;s surveillance, yes. Daily updates.&quot; Hannah hesitated, then added, &quot;He has no idea we&#x27;re onto him, or that we&#x27;re correcting the sabotage.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Keep it that way,&quot; Camille said. &quot;We need Rose and her partner to believe their plan is working.&quot;<br/><br/>**** **<br/><br/>James Walsh wiped sweat from his forehead as he finished installing the modified circuit board. His hands shook slightly, they always did now, ever since he&#x27;d gotten involved in this mess. The empty construction site felt eerie at night, lit only by temporary work lights that cast long shadows across the unfinished walls.<br/><br/>The job had seemed straightforward when he&#x27;d agreed to it. A man claiming to represent one of Kane Industries&#x27; competitors had approached him with an offer: make some small modifications to the Phoenix Grid components, get paid fifty thousand dollars. Enough to finally pay off his ex-wife&#x27;s medical bills, enough to maybe start seeing his kids again.<br/><br/>&quot;Just delay the project,&quot; the man had said. &quot;Nothing dangerous. Just enough problems to give our company time to catch up.&quot;<br/><br/>But as the modifications grew more extensive, Walsh had begun to suspect that wasn&#x27;t true. Still, he couldn&#x27;t back out. Not after the man&#x27;s subtle threats about his children. Not after accepting the first payment.<br/><br/>He closed the access panel and packed up his tools. One more component installed according to the modified blueprints. One step closer to being done with this nightmare.<br/><br/>His phone buzzed in his pocket. Walsh jumped, nearly dropping his toolbox. His heart hammered as he checked the caller ID: UNKNOWN.<br/><br/>With trembling fingers, he answered. &quot;Hello?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Progress report.&quot; The man&#x27;s voice was smooth, cultured, betraying no hint of emotion.<br/><br/>Walsh swallowed hard. &quot;Installed the J-14 connector tonight, just like the blueprints showed. That&#x27;s the last one in the east section.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And has anyone questioned your work?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No,&quot; Walsh said, the lie coming easily now after weeks of practice. &quot;The engineering team is focused on the main grid. No one&#x27;s double-checking the secondary systems.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Excellent.&quot; The man paused. &quot;Any unusual activity at the site? Security changes? Late-night work?&quot;<br/><br/>Walsh hesitated. He had noticed some of the day crew grumbling about equipment being moved overnight, but he&#x27;d assumed it was just another team working different hours.<br/><br/>&quot;No,&quot; he said finally. &quot;Everything&#x27;s normal.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Good. Continue as planned. Remember, Mr. Walsh, your children&#x27;s future depends on your discretion.&quot;<br/><br/>The line went dead. Walsh stared at the phone, bile rising in his throat. What had he gotten himself into?</div>
