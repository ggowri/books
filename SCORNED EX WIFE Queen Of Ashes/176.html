        <h1>Chapter 116-2</h1>
        <div><br/>His smile faded, replaced by something more vulnerable. &quot;Connection,&quot; he said simply. &quot;My whole life, I&#x27;ve been the outsider. The weird kid who was too smart for his own good. The black sheep of the family. The businessman who didn&#x27;t play by the rules.&quot;<br/><br/>He looked out over the water. &quot;All that success, all that power... it creates distance. Separation. Sometimes I stand in a room full of people who work for me, who respect me, who fear me... and I&#x27;ve never felt more alone.&quot;<br/><br/>The admission, so raw, so unexpectedly honest, struck Camille deeply. She recognized the loneliness he described. She had felt it herself, standing at Victoria&#x27;s side at countless events, powerful and feared, yet utterly separate from everyone around her.<br/><br/>&quot;Is that why you helped me?&quot; she asked softly. &quot;Because you recognized another outsider?&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander met her gaze. &quot;I helped you because you once helped me, though you didn&#x27;t remember it. I stayed because I saw in you something rare, someone who understood power not as an end, but as a means. Someone who could wield it without being consumed by it.&quot;<br/><br/>He reached out, his fingers lightly touching a strand of hair that had blown across her face, tucking it behind her ear. The gesture, so simple yet intimate, made Camille&#x27;s breath catch.<br/><br/>&quot;And because when I&#x27;m with you,&quot; he continued, his voice lower now, &quot;I don&#x27;t feel alone.&quot;<br/><br/>The admission hung between them, changing the air, making it thick with possibility. Camille found herself leaning toward him, drawn by a force as inexorable as gravity.<br/><br/>&quot;I thought I was dead inside,&quot; she whispered. &quot;After what Rose and Stefan did. After what I became to survive it. I thought that part of me, the part that could feel anything beyond anger or satisfaction at winning, was gone forever.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s hand cupped her cheek, his touch gentle as if she might break, or flee. &quot;And now?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Now I&#x27;m not so sure.&quot;<br/><br/>His eyes searched hers, looking for permission, for certainty. Camille closed the distance between them, pressing her lips to his, answering his unspoken question.<br/><br/>The kiss was tentative at first, exploring, questioning. Then something shifted, a dam breaking inside her. Camille&#x27;s arms wound around his neck, pulling him closer as the kiss deepened, awakening sensations she had thought forever lost to her.<br/><br/>When they finally broke apart, both breathing hard, Alexander rested his forehead against hers. &quot;I&#x27;ve wanted to do that since the night of the children&#x27;s benefit,&quot; he confessed. &quot;When you stood there with impossible dignity while Rose and Stefan begged for your help, not knowing who you really were.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille smiled, a genuine smile that reached her eyes. &quot;I&#x27;ve wanted you to do that since you put that ridiculous diamond necklace around my neck and scandalized Victoria.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander laughed, the sound rich and warm in the afternoon air. &quot;Worth every penny of that hundred million.&quot;<br/><br/>His hand found hers, fingers intertwining. &quot;We should eat. The chef prepared lunch before we left the marina.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Later,&quot; Camille murmured, pulling him back to her.<br/><br/>This time, there was no hesitation in their kiss, no question, only certainty. Camille felt something unfurling inside her, not just desire, but a kind of rebirth. The woman who had been broken, who had rebuilt herself into a weapon of revenge, was becoming something else entirely. Someone who could want things for herself, not just the destruction of her enemies.<br/><br/>They moved together below deck, to the master cabin with its wide bed and windows that framed the endless ocean. There, with sunlight streaming across tangled sheets, Camille let herself feel everything she had denied for so long, pleasure, tenderness, hunger, joy.<br/><br/>Afterward, they lay together, her head on Alexander&#x27;s chest, listening to the steady rhythm of his heartbeat. The yacht rocked gently beneath them, a lullaby of water against the hull.<br/><br/>&quot;I never expected this,&quot; Camille said quietly. &quot;You. This feeling. Any of it.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s fingers traced patterns along her bare shoulder. &quot;When we first properly met, not counting that hospital room years ago, what did you see?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;A powerful man who could help me destroy my enemies,&quot; she admitted. &quot;A useful ally. A means to an end.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And now?&quot;<br/><br/>Camille raised herself on one elbow, looking into his eyes. &quot;Someone who knows all my broken pieces and doesn&#x27;t try to fix them. Someone who sees the woman beneath the revenge, beneath the power. Someone who makes me wonder what might come after all this is over.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander smiled, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. &quot;And that terrifies you.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Completely,&quot; she agreed.<br/><br/>&quot;Good,&quot; he said, pulling her back down against him. &quot;Terror means it matters.&quot;<br/><br/>They stayed that way for a long time, the world beyond the yacht forgotten. Eventually, they dressed and made their way back to the deck, where lunch waited, seafood and fresh bread, fruit and cheese, simple pleasures that tasted better here, with the sky vast above them and the city nowhere in sight.<br/><br/>As the sun began its descent toward the horizon, Camille stood at the railing again, watching the light change from gold to amber across the water. Alexander stood behind her, arms encircling her waist, chin resting lightly on the top of her head.<br/><br/>&quot;We should head back soon,&quot; he said, though he made no move to release her.<br/><br/>Camille nodded, but remained where she was, memorizing the moment, the warmth of Alexander against her back, the salt spray on her lips, the endless possibility of the horizon.<br/><br/>For the first time since Victoria had found her in that parking garage eighteen months ago, Camille allowed herself to imagine a future defined not by what she was running from, but by what she was running toward. Not revenge, but creation. Not power, but purpose. Not isolation, but connection.<br/><br/>&quot;Four hours wasn&#x27;t enough,&quot; she said softly.<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s arms tightened around her. &quot;No,&quot; he agreed. &quot;But it&#x27;s a start.&quot;<br/><br/>As the yacht turned back toward Manhattan, the city skyline appearing once more in the distance, Camille felt something settling inside her,not an ending, but a beginning.<br/></div>
