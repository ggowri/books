        <h1>Chapter 56-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 56<br/><br/>Rain lashed against the penthouse windows, matching the storm brewing inside. Rose stared at Stefan across the living room, his posture rigid as he clutched his phone in a white-knuckled grip. The text message glowed on the screen between them, another buyer canceling their order, another financial blow to her already crumbling fashion empire.<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s the third cancellation today,&quot; Rose said, fighting to keep her voice steady. &quot;Bergdorf claims &#x27;brand association concerns.&#x27; As if they&#x27;ve suddenly developed a moral conscience.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan didn&#x27;t look up. &quot;Did you sleep with him too?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The Bergdorf buyer.&quot; His voice held a coldness she&#x27;d never heard before. &quot;Did you sleep with him like you did with Jonathan Hayes? Like you did with Lord Hartley? Like you apparently did with half of London while I was here, thinking about you every day?&quot;<br/><br/>Rose flinched as if he&#x27;d slapped her. &quot;That&#x27;s not fair.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Fair?&quot; Stefan finally looked up, eyes red-rimmed from lack of sleep. &quot;The photos are everywhere, Rose. The financial records linking you to Bessonov. The evidence keeps piling up, and every time I think I&#x27;ve seen the worst, something new emerges.&quot;<br/><br/>She moved to the bar, pouring herself a drink with hands that trembled slightly. Three weeks since the first scandal photos had emerged. Three weeks of constant new revelations, each one more damaging than the last. Three weeks of watching everything she&#x27;d built crumble beneath her.<br/><br/>&quot;Those photos are from years ago,&quot; she said, the defense sounding weak even to her own ears. &quot;Before us. Before...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Before us?&quot; Stefan laughed, a harsh sound devoid of humor. &quot;The timestamps, Rose. Did you think no one would notice the timestamps? You were on that yacht with Bessonov the same week you called me from &#x27;Paris&#x27; to say how much you missed me. The same month you told me you were focusing on your fashion education.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose drained her glass, the alcohol burning a path down her throat. Outside, lightning flashed, briefly illuminating the rain-drenched city below.<br/><br/>&quot;Everyone has a past,&quot; she tried again. &quot;Things they&#x27;re not proud of. Things they&#x27;d rather forget.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;A past is one thing. Lies are another.&quot; Stefan moved to the window, putting distance between them. &quot;I could have accepted mistakes, Rose. I could have understood poor choices. What I can&#x27;t accept is that everything, everything, you ever told me was manufactured. Calculated.&quot;<br/><br/>The truth of his words stung more than she wanted to admit. Her entire life had been a series of careful calculations, strategic moves to achieve the position, the power, the prestige she&#x27;d always craved.<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s not true,&quot; she said, voice smaller than intended. &quot;My feelings for you were real. Are real.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Were they?&quot; He turned to face her again. &quot;Or was I just part of your plan? A stepping stone to the life you wanted? The same way my company was a stepping stone for your fashion line&#x27;s shipping needs?&quot;<br/><br/>Rose set down her glass with more force than necessary. &quot;That&#x27;s not fair. My business success came from talent, from hard work, from...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;From sleeping with your mentor&#x27;s husband to steal design concepts?&quot; Stefan cut in. &quot;From using Bessonov&#x27;s money to fund your first collection? From manipulating fashion editors into featuring your work?&quot;<br/><br/>Each accusation landed like a physical blow. All the carefully hidden truths, all the meticulously buried secrets, exposed for everyone to see. For Stefan to see.<br/><br/>&quot;You don&#x27;t understand,&quot; she said, desperation creeping into her voice. &quot;I did what I had to do. Coming from nothing, having nothing... you can&#x27;t judge me for fighting my way up.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Coming from nothing?&quot; Stefan&#x27;s expression shifted from anger to confusion. &quot;Your parents are wealthy. You grew up with every advantage.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose froze, realizing her mistake too late. Another calculation error in a month filled with them. Another slip that revealed more than intended.<br/><br/>&quot;I meant... professionally,&quot; she backtracked quickly. &quot;In the fashion world, no one takes you seriously without the right connections. I had to make my own way.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan studied her, suspicion replacing confusion. &quot;You&#x27;ve never talked about your life before the Lewises adopted you. Not once in all the years I&#x27;ve known you.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Because it doesn&#x27;t matter.&quot; Rose turned away, reaching for the bottle again. &quot;That was a different life. A different person.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Was it?&quot; Stefan moved closer, his voice softening dangerously. &quot;Or is this just another story you&#x27;ve constructed? Another manipulation to get what you want?&quot;<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s hand tightened around her glass. &quot;You don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I think I&#x27;m finally starting to.&quot; He picked up his phone again, swiping through more headlines about her scandals. &quot;All these photos. All these stories. They&#x27;re not just about affairs or business dealings. They&#x27;re showing me who you really are, Rose. Who you&#x27;ve always been.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And who is that?&quot; she demanded, anger flaring to mask the fear beneath.<br/><br/>&quot;Someone who takes what she wants, regardless of who gets hurt.&quot; Stefan&#x27;s voice was steady now, his initial rage cooling into something more dangerous, clarity. &quot;Someone who sees people as stepping stones rather than human beings. Someone who&#x27;s been playing a role for so long she&#x27;s forgotten there was ever anything genuine underneath.&quot;<br/><br/>The assessment hit too close to truth. Rose switched tactics, moving toward him with practiced vulnerability, eyes softening in the way she knew had always worked on him before.<br/><br/>&quot;Stefan, please. This is all just a misunderstanding. A smear campaign by someone who wants to destroy me. Destroy us.&quot; She reached for his hand. &quot;We can get through this together. Save both our businesses. Show everyone they can&#x27;t tear us apart.&quot;<br/><br/>He pulled away from her touch. &quot;That&#x27;s just it, Rose. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s an &#x27;us&#x27; to save. I&#x27;m not sure there ever was.&quot;</div>
