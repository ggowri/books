        <h1>Chapter 169-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 169<br/><br/>Rain pelted the black waters of Cedar Lake as Alexander and Stefan crouched in the underbrush. The angry sky rumbled above them, lightning flashing in the distance. Through night-vision goggles, Alexander scanned the cabin that held Camille.<br/><br/>What had once been a rustic family retreat now resembled a fortress. Motion sensors dotted the tree line. Cameras swept the property in careful arcs. Two men with rifles patrolled the perimeter, their movements precise and military.<br/><br/>&quot;She&#x27;s turned it into a damn compound,&quot; Alexander whispered, his jaw tight with tension.<br/><br/>Stefan wiped rain from his face. &quot;Rose never does anything halfway.&quot;<br/><br/>They&#x27;d left the boats hidden behind the split pine tree Margaret had called the &quot;twin tree,&quot; the water team of six men now spread through the woods. The road team waited on the other side of the property, ready for Alexander&#x27;s signal.<br/><br/>&quot;Talk me through it again,&quot; Alexander said, his voice barely audible over the rain. &quot;Every entrance. Every weak point.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan closed his eyes, picturing the cabin he&#x27;d never visited but had heard described so many times.<br/><br/>&quot;Front door faces the road. Back door opens to the lake. There&#x27;s a cellar entrance on the east side, hidden under a fake rock garden.&quot; His hands shook as he pointed. &quot;Kitchen window has a broken lock, or it did when the Lewis family owned it. Margaret always complained about it letting in cold air.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander relayed the information through his earpiece to the teams. The rain grew heavier, a blessing that muffled their approach and blinded the cameras.<br/><br/>A guard passed just fifteen feet from their position. Alexander tensed, hand moving to his weapon, but the man continued his patrol, unaware of their presence.<br/><br/>&quot;Six minutes until the road team creates their distraction,&quot; Alexander murmured. &quot;Then we move.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan nodded, clutching the small fishing lure Margaret had given him. The wood felt rough against his palm, a connection to a time when Camille had been happy, before he and Rose had destroyed everything.<br/><br/>Thunder crashed overhead as lightning lit the sky. In the brief flash, Stefan saw Alexander&#x27;s face, not the controlled businessman he knew, but something primal and dangerous.<br/><br/>&quot;If anything happens to her...&quot; Alexander&#x27;s words trailed off.<br/><br/>&quot;It won&#x27;t,&quot; Stefan said, trying to believe it himself.<br/><br/>Alexander checked his watch. &quot;Two minutes. Jason, position report.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;East side secure,&quot; came the whispered reply through their earpieces. &quot;We&#x27;ve identified three motion sensors and a trip wire. All disabled.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;West team?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;In position. Guard approaching. Hold.&quot;<br/><br/>Tense seconds ticked by. Rain drummed against the leaves sheltering them.<br/><br/>&quot;Guard passed. West side ready.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander turned to Stefan. &quot;You stay behind me at all times. If I say run, you run. If I say hide, you hide. No heroics.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan wanted to argue, but the steel in Alexander&#x27;s eyes stopped him. This was a side of Alexander Pierce that few ever saw—the man beneath the tailored suits and boardroom smiles.<br/><br/>&quot;Thirty seconds,&quot; Alexander said.<br/><br/>Stefan tucked the lure safely in his pocket and checked his own equipment one last time. Unlike the others, he carried no weapon. Alexander had been clear about that.<br/><br/>&quot;Camille is being held in what appears to be a basement or lower level,&quot; Jason reported. &quot;Thermal imaging shows one guard at the exterior cellar entrance.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s our way in,&quot; Alexander said. &quot;Road team, begin distraction on my mark.&quot;<br/><br/>The seconds stretched like hours. Stefan&#x27;s heart hammered in his chest, a mixture of fear and determination driving his pulse skyward.<br/><br/>&quot;Mark.&quot;<br/><br/>In the distance, an explosion rocked the night. A moment later, a plume of fire rose above the treeline near the main road. The guards outside snapped to attention, their movements suddenly urgent.<br/><br/>&quot;Now.&quot; Alexander signaled, and they were moving through the rain.<br/><br/>They kept low to the ground, following a path Stefan had described from Camille&#x27;s stories, a narrow deer trail that led to the old stone garden. The fire burned bright in the distance, drawing the attention of the guards.<br/><br/>&quot;East side, report,&quot; Alexander whispered.<br/><br/>&quot;Both guards moving toward the road. Main house entrance clear.&quot;<br/><br/>They reached the stone garden, now overgrown but still recognizable. Stefan pointed to a large flat rock tucked against the foundation.<br/><br/>&quot;There.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander nodded to his security team. Two men stepped forward, shifting the heavy stone to reveal a set of concrete steps descending into darkness.<br/><br/>&quot;Single guard at the bottom of the stairs,&quot; reported Jason, checking a handheld thermal device. &quot;Sitting position. Likely armed.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander drew his weapon. &quot;I&#x27;ll take point. Stefan, you stay here until...&quot;<br/><br/>A crackle of static cut through their earpieces.<br/><br/>&quot;Road team under fire! Multiple armed tangos emerging from the woods!&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s face hardened. &quot;Rose has backup.&quot; He turned to Jason. &quot;We need to move. Now.&quot;<br/><br/>Everything accelerated. Alexander disappeared down the steps, followed by two of his men. Seconds later, a muffled thud echoed from below.<br/><br/>&quot;Clear,&quot; came Alexander&#x27;s voice. &quot;Stefan, get down here.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan scrambled down the steps into a dimly lit storage area. A guard lay unconscious on the floor, efficiently restrained.<br/><br/>Alexander pointed to a metal door across the room. &quot;Thermal shows two heat signatures behind that door. One seated, one moving.&quot;<br/><br/>The sound of gunfire echoed in the distance.<br/><br/>&quot;Road team falling back to secondary position,&quot; reported the team leader. &quot;We&#x27;ve got at least six armed men in pursuit.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander cursed under his breath. &quot;She was ready for us.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We still have surprise on this side,&quot; Jason reminded him. &quot;They&#x27;re focused on the road team.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander nodded. &quot;Stack up. Breach on three.&quot;<br/><br/>The team moved into position around the door. Stefan pressed himself against the wall, heart in his throat.<br/><br/>&quot;Wait,&quot; Jason whispered suddenly, ear pressed to the door. &quot;I hear movement. Someone&#x27;s talking.&quot;<br/><br/>They froze, listening. A female voice, Rose&#x27;s voice came through faintly.</div>
