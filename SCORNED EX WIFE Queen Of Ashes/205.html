        <h1>Chapter 135-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 135<br/><br/>A thunderous boom shook the early morning quiet. Orange flame shot into the dark sky as Substation 12 of the Phoenix Grid exploded. Pieces of metal and concrete flew in all directions. The night security guard, having stepped outside for a cigarette moments earlier, stared in shock from the parking lot.<br/><br/>Three blocks away, Rose watched from the passenger seat of a stolen van, her face lit by the distant flames. A small smile played on her lips as smoke rose into the night sky.<br/><br/>&quot;Beautiful,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Just like I planned.&quot;<br/><br/>Beside her, Herod gripped the steering wheel, his face tight. &quot;Drive now, admire later,&quot; he said, shifting the van into gear. &quot;Security cameras might have caught us.&quot;<br/><br/>As they sped away, emergency sirens began to wail in the distance. Fire trucks and police cars raced toward the burning substation.<br/><br/>&quot;Phase one complete,&quot; Rose said, her voice filled with satisfaction. &quot;Now we wait for phase two, the system collapse.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod kept his eyes on the road, his mind racing through escape routes, contingency plans. There was no going back now. They had crossed the final line.<br/><br/>*** **<br/><br/>Camille jolted awake to the sound of her phone ringing. She fumbled for it in the darkness, Alexander stirring beside her.<br/><br/>&quot;Camille Kane,&quot; she answered, voice still thick with sleep.<br/><br/>Her body tensed as she listened. &quot;How bad?&quot; she asked, already climbing out of bed. &quot;How many injured?&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander sat up, instantly alert at her tone.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ll be there in twenty minutes,&quot; Camille said, ending the call. She turned to Alexander, her face pale in the dim light. &quot;Someone bombed Substation 12. No one hurt, but the Grid is destabilizing.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Rose,&quot; Alexander said. It wasn&#x27;t a question.<br/><br/>&quot;Has to be.&quot; Camille pulled clothes from her closet with shaking hands. &quot;Hannah&#x27;s already at control headquarters. The backup systems are holding for now, but if we don&#x27;t reroute power soon, we could lose the whole eastern sector.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander was already dressing. &quot;I&#x27;ll drive you.&quot;<br/><br/>They raced through the pre-dawn streets, the city still quiet except for emergency vehicles heading toward the smoke rising in the distance. Camille clutched her phone, watching real-time alerts from the Grid&#x27;s monitoring system.<br/><br/>&quot;Junction 17 showing stress,&quot; she muttered. &quot;Power loads increasing on the northern relay.&quot;<br/><br/>Her phone rang again. Hannah&#x27;s voice came through, tight with panic.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s spreading faster than we predicted,&quot; she said without preamble. &quot;The safety protocols are shutting down relays to prevent overload, but that&#x27;s pushing too much power to the remaining stations.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Can you bypass the safety protocols manually?&quot; Camille asked.<br/><br/>&quot;Too risky. We&#x27;d burn out the whole system. We need to redirect the power flow from the damaged substation.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m almost there,&quot; Camille promised.<br/><br/>The Grid control center hummed with frantic activity when they arrived. Engineers rushed between workstations. Warning signals flashed on screens. Hannah stood in the center, issuing instructions, her usual calm replaced by tense urgency.<br/><br/>&quot;Camille!&quot; Relief washed over Hannah&#x27;s face. &quot;The situation&#x27;s getting worse.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille moved immediately to the main control panel. Displays showed the Phoenix Grid as an interconnected web of light. One section glowed angry red—Substation 12 and its connecting relays. Yellow warning indicators spread outward like a disease, showing stress points throughout the system.<br/><br/>&quot;Where will it fail next?&quot; she asked, eyes scanning the data.<br/><br/>Hannah pointed to three junctions. &quot;Any of these could go. When one does, it will trigger a cascade.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander studied the schematics over Camille&#x27;s shoulder. &quot;Can you isolate Substation 12 completely?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;If we do, we lose power to eight city blocks,&quot; Hannah replied.<br/><br/>&quot;Better than losing the whole eastern sector,&quot; Camille decided. &quot;Do it.&quot;<br/><br/>Hannah typed commands into the system. On the main display, the connections to Substation 12 went dark. Warning lights across the board flashed as the Grid adjusted to the sudden change.<br/><br/>&quot;Power load redistributing,&quot; Hannah reported. &quot;Junction 24 now at ninety-five percent capacity. That&#x27;s too high.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille leaned forward, fingers flying across the keyboard. &quot;Rerouting through the western sector backup. System should balance in three... two... one...&quot;<br/><br/>The warning lights for Junction 24 shifted from red to yellow, then green.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s holding,&quot; Hannah said, not quite believing it.<br/><br/>&quot;For now,&quot; Camille cautioned. &quot;But we&#x27;ve lost redundancy. If there&#x27;s another failure—&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s phone rang. He stepped away to answer, his expression growing darker as he listened.<br/><br/>&quot;Police found evidence of explosives at the substation,&quot; he reported when he returned. &quot;Professional job. They&#x27;re checking security footage now.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille&#x27;s fists clenched. &quot;She&#x27;s escalated. This isn&#x27;t just sabotage anymore.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The press is already at the scene,&quot; Alexander added. &quot;They&#x27;re calling it a terrorist attack on the Grid.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille felt sick. After all their work, all their success, Rose had managed to cast a shadow over the Grid&#x27;s triumph. If public confidence in the system fell, everything they&#x27;d built could collapse.</div>
