        <h1>Chapter 116-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 116<br/><br/>The yacht cut through the water, leaving a trail of white foam in its wake. Camille stood at the railing, wind whipping her hair across her face as the Manhattan skyline receded behind them. For the first time in weeks, the constant hum of tension in her shoulders began to ease.<br/><br/>Three days had passed since Victoria&#x27;s surgery. Three days of Camille dividing her time between the hospital and the office, maintaining the fiction that Victoria was simply recovering from exhaustion while privately overseeing her medical care. The doctors reported steady improvement, Victoria Kane fighting her way back to health with the same determination she applied to everything else in her life.<br/><br/>&quot;Penny for your thoughts?&quot;<br/><br/>Camille turned to find Alexander approaching, two glasses of wine in hand. He had changed from his usual impeccable suit into jeans and a simple white linen shirt that billowed slightly in the breeze. The casual attire transformed him from corporate titan to something else entirely, just a man on a boat, enjoying the afternoon sun.<br/><br/>&quot;I was wondering how you convinced me to leave my phone behind,&quot; she said, accepting the glass he offered.<br/><br/>Alexander smiled. &quot;I can be persuasive when necessary.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Four hours,&quot; she reminded him. &quot;That&#x27;s all I can spare.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Four hours of no calls, no emails, no crisis management,&quot; he agreed. &quot;Just you, me, and the Atlantic Ocean.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille took a sip of wine, letting the rich taste linger on her tongue. Beyond the bow of the yacht, the water stretched endlessly, sunlight dancing across the surface like scattered diamonds.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s beautiful,&quot; she admitted.<br/><br/>&quot;Come see the rest,&quot; Alexander said, holding out his hand.<br/><br/>She hesitated only briefly before taking it, allowing him to lead her across the polished deck. The yacht—*Solitude*, Alexander had called it, was smaller than she&#x27;d expected, designed for intimate gatherings rather than ostentatious displays of wealth. Its gleaming surfaces and elegant lines spoke of quiet luxury rather than excess.<br/><br/>He guided her through the main cabin with its panoramic windows, past a dining area where a table had been set for two, and out onto a smaller deck at the stern. Here, away from the wind, the afternoon sun warmed Camille&#x27;s skin. Cushioned loungers invited relaxation, something she had almost forgotten how to do.<br/><br/>&quot;You bought this after your company went public,&quot; Camille said, recalling a detail Alexander had once mentioned.<br/><br/>He nodded. &quot;My one indulgence. Everyone expected me to buy a mansion or a fleet of cars. Instead, I wanted something that could take me away from everything, even if just for a few hours.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille settled onto one of the loungers, tucking her legs beneath her. &quot;Is that what we&#x27;re doing today? Running away?&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander sat across from her, his eyes reflecting the blue of the ocean. &quot;Not running away. Running toward.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Toward what?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That,&quot; he said, gesturing toward the horizon, &quot;is the question I brought you here to explore.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille raised an eyebrow. &quot;I thought you brought me here because Victoria ordered you to keep me from working myself into exhaustion.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander laughed. &quot;That too. She called from her hospital bed specifically to instruct me to &#x27;get Camille off-premises before she terrorizes the entire staff.&#x27;&quot;<br/><br/>The thought of Victoria issuing commands while recovering from major surgery made Camille smile. &quot;She knows me too well.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;She knows you need to breathe,&quot; Alexander corrected gently. &quot;Just for a moment. To remember there&#x27;s a world beyond Kane Industries and the war with Rose and Herod.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille looked away, her gaze finding the distant horizon where sea met sky in a seamless blue line. &quot;Sometimes I can&#x27;t remember what that world looks like anymore.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander leaned forward. &quot;What did you want? Before all of this. Before Stefan and Rose&#x27;s betrayal, before Victoria, before revenge became your north star.&quot;<br/><br/>The question caught her off guard. Camille took another sip of wine, buying time as memories surfaced, dreams and ambitions she had buried so deeply she&#x27;d almost forgotten their existence.<br/><br/>&quot;I wanted to write,&quot; she said finally. &quot;Not novels or poetry. Journalism. Stories that mattered. I was good at it, too. In college, I won awards for investigative pieces.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What happened?&quot;<br/><br/>Camille&#x27;s fingers tightened around the stem of her glass. &quot;I met Stefan. He was charming, ambitious, from a &#x27;good family.&#x27; My parents approved. His career became the priority. Mine became... supporting his.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And now?&quot; Alexander prompted. &quot;When this is over, when Rose and Herod are defeated, when Victoria recovers and retakes her place, what will Camille Kane want then?&quot;<br/><br/>The question hung in the air between them. What did she want beyond survival, beyond revenge, beyond proving herself worthy of Victoria&#x27;s faith in her?<br/><br/>&quot;I don&#x27;t know,&quot; she admitted, the words emerging with unexpected honesty. &quot;For so long, it&#x27;s been about destruction, dismantling what Rose and Stefan built, exposing their lies, making them pay. I haven&#x27;t thought much about... creation.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander set his glass aside and moved to sit beside her, close enough that she could feel the warmth of him, yet not touching.<br/><br/>&quot;The Phoenix Grid,&quot; he suggested. &quot;That&#x27;s creation, not destruction.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded slowly. &quot;Yes. The first thing I&#x27;ve built rather than torn down. It felt... different. Better.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What else would you build, if you could build anything?&quot;<br/><br/>The question opened something inside her, a door to possibilities she hadn&#x27;t allowed herself to imagine. &quot;A foundation, maybe. Something to help women who&#x27;ve been betrayed, abandoned, abused. Not just with money, but with the tools to rebuild themselves. To find their power.&quot;<br/><br/>The words spilled out, gaining momentum as she spoke. &quot;Something that combines what I wanted before, telling stories that matter, with what I know now about survival and transformation.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander watched her face, a smile playing at the corners of his mouth. &quot;I can see it in your eyes. The spark. It&#x27;s been missing.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What about you?&quot; Camille asked, turning the question back on him. &quot;The great Alexander Pierce, with his empire of ships and tech companies and clean energy initiatives. What do you want beyond more zeroes in your bank account?&quot;</div>
