        <h1>Chapter 117</h1>
        <div><p>Chapter 117<br/><br/>The Kane Industries conference center buzzed with tension as stockholders filed into the auditorium. Camille watched from the wings, studying the anxious faces of investors and board members gathering for the emergency meeting.<br/><br/>Hannah Zhao approached with a tablet. &quot;Everything&#x27;s running perfectly. All Grid systems nominal.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And the independent assessment?&quot; Camille asked.<br/><br/>&quot;Just arrived.&quot; Hannah handed her a sealed envelope. &quot;The Grid exceeds every safety parameter by significant margins.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded, scanning the room again. &quot;Is Herod here?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Fifth row center, moving toward the front.&quot;<br/><br/>She spotted him, confident and poised as he greeted several board members. The stage manager appeared, signaling they were ready.<br/><br/>Camille straightened Victoria&#x27;s midnight blue jacket, tailored to fit her perfectly. Wearing it felt like carrying a piece of Victoria&#x27;s strength.<br/><br/>&quot;He wants you to lose your temper,&quot; Hannah reminded her. &quot;To appear emotional, unstable.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I know exactly what he wants,&quot; Camille replied. &quot;And he won&#x27;t get it.&quot;<br/><br/>She stepped onto the stage, heels clicking against the polished floor as she moved to the podium.<br/><br/>&quot;Good morning,&quot; she began, her voice steady. &quot;Thank you for attending this emergency meeting. As interim CEO during Victoria Kane&#x27;s recovery, I felt it necessary to address certain rumors regarding the Phoenix Grid project.&quot;<br/><br/>She paused, finding Herod&#x27;s face in the crowd. &quot;Before we begin, Ms. Kane&#x27;s doctors report excellent progress in her recovery from exhaustion. She expects to return to full duties within two weeks.&quot;<br/><br/>A murmur ran through the audience. Victoria&#x27;s collapse had already affected their stock price, dropping it three percent.<br/><br/>&quot;The Phoenix Grid represents Kane Industries&#x27; commitment to revolutionizing urban power distribution,&quot; Camille continued, displaying performance metrics. &quot;Power efficiency has exceeded projections by twelve percent. Maintenance costs are trending seventeen percent below budget. And most importantly, zero safety incidents since inception.&quot;<br/><br/>As she presented more data, she noticed Herod rising from his seat.<br/><br/>&quot;Ms. Kane,&quot; he called out. &quot;If I might address the gathering?&quot;<br/><br/>The room fell silent, all eyes shifting between them.<br/><br/>&quot;Mr. Preston,&quot; she acknowledged, tone neutral. &quot;I wasn&#x27;t aware you were a Kane Industries shareholder.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod smiled, the expression not reaching his eyes. &quot;A recent acquisition. My company now holds five percent of Kane Industries stock.&quot;<br/><br/>Louder murmurs spread through the audience. Five percent was significant, not enough for control, but enough to demand attention.<br/><br/>&quot;In that case,&quot; Camille said smoothly, &quot;you&#x27;re certainly entitled to speak. Please join me.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod climbed the steps with unhurried confidence, stopping at a distance that might appear respectful to observers but felt intrusive to Camille.<br/><br/>&quot;As a significant shareholder, I feel compelled to express concerns about the Phoenix Grid that have recently come to my attention,&quot; he began, withdrawing a folder. &quot;I&#x27;ve received technical analyses from several independent engineers who believe the Grid&#x27;s current configuration poses serious safety risks.&quot;<br/><br/>He displayed diagrams showing theoretical failure points. &quot;These experts flag three critical issues: relay overheating during peak demand, insufficient circuit breaker redundancy, and potentially catastrophic failure scenarios during power surges. Under certain conditions, sections of the Grid could experience cascading failures leading to explosions and fires.&quot;<br/><br/>The audience shifted uncomfortably. A board member scribbled furious notes.<br/><br/>&quot;I bring these concerns forward not as an attack,&quot; Herod continued with false sincerity, &quot;but out of genuine concern for public safety and shareholder value. If these issues prove valid, the liability alone could bankrupt the company.&quot;<br/><br/>He turned to Camille. &quot;Perhaps Ms. Kane could address these technical concerns? Although, with her background in, what was it before Victoria Kane adopted you? Fashion marketing? she might want to defer to actual engineers.&quot;<br/><br/>The deliberate slight hung in the air. Camille felt anger flash but contained it, studying the diagrams with calm consideration.<br/><br/>&quot;Thank you for your concern, Mr. Preston,&quot; she said coolly. &quot;May I ask about the source of these analyses?&quot;<br/><br/>Herod shrugged. &quot;The engineers prefer to remain anonymous, fearing professional repercussions.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I understand completely,&quot; Camille replied. &quot;Dr. Zhao, would you join us please?&quot;<br/><br/>Hannah crossed to the podium. Camille introduced her: &quot;Dr. Hannah Zhao, chief engineer of the Phoenix Grid project. MIT doctorate in electrical engineering, former lead designer for the European Union&#x27;s sustainable energy initiative.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille turned back to Herod. &quot;Before addressing your anonymous concerns, I&#x27;d like to present some attribution-friendly data.&quot;<br/><br/>Hannah uploaded new diagrams. &quot;These are the actual schematics of the Phoenix Grid as currently implemented, not the theoretical models Mr. Preston presented.&quot;<br/><br/>With methodical clarity, Camille walked the audience through each system. &quot;The Grid employs quadruple, not triple, relay protection systems. Each junction includes three independent circuit breakers with automatic cut-off protocols.&quot;<br/><br/>She pulled the sealed envelope from her portfolio. &quot;This morning, we received the final report from Blackwood Engineering, the industry&#x27;s most respected independent safety assessment firm. Their conclusion: the Phoenix Grid exceeds federal safety standards by 327 percent.&quot;<br/><br/>She displayed the report with Blackwood&#x27;s certification clearly visible.<br/><br/>&quot;As for power surges, the Grid includes surge protectors at every connection point. We&#x27;ve tested the system against surges five times stronger than anything recorded in New York&#x27;s history.&quot;<br/><br/>She turned to face Herod directly. &quot;Interestingly, the diagrams Mr. Preston presented appear to be based on outdated blueprints, blueprints that were altered during a recent attempted sabotage of our systems.&quot;<br/><br/>A shocked silence fell over the room.<br/><br/>&quot;Kane Industries discovered this sabotage attempt three weeks ago. The FBI has been investigating quietly to avoid market panic. We have reason to believe the modified blueprints were created specifically to make the Grid appear unsafe.&quot;<br/><br/>She paused, letting her gaze move from Herod to Martin Greene, who had gone pale in his seat. &quot;We&#x27;ve identified the internal source of the leak and have terminated their employment as of this morning.&quot;<br/><br/>Security personnel moved discreetly toward Martin, who stood abruptly, knocking over his coffee in his haste to reach the exit.<br/><br/>Herod maintained his composure, though a muscle twitched in his jaw. &quot;These are serious allegations. I merely presented concerns brought to my attention as a responsible shareholder.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Of course,&quot; Camille agreed pleasantly. &quot;Which is why I&#x27;ve prepared copies of Dr. Zhao&#x27;s full technical report for all shareholders, along with the Blackwood certification and contact information for their engineers, who are happy to answer questions about their findings.&quot;<br/><br/>Assistants distributed folders to the audience.<br/><br/>&quot;To further demonstrate our confidence in the Phoenix Grid,&quot; Camille continued, &quot;Kane Industries&#x27; global headquarters will be the first building to transition entirely to Grid power next week, three months ahead of schedule. Victoria Kane and I will personally be working from those offices during the transition. We believe in the safety of our technology enough to bet our lives on it.&quot;<br/><br/>The audience erupted in applause. Camille saw Herod reassessing as his ambush transformed into a victory for Kane Industries.<br/><br/>When the applause died down, Camille asked, &quot;Are there any other questions about the Grid&#x27;s specifications or safety features?&quot;<br/><br/>Leonard Ackerman, their largest investor, stood. &quot;I think Ms. Kane has addressed the concerns comprehensively. I&#x27;m satisfied with the safety protocols and impressed with the leadership displayed today.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;In that case,&quot; she said, &quot;I suggest we adjourn the emergency portion of this meeting.&quot;<br/><br/>As the meeting transitioned, Herod leaned close while her microphone was off. &quot;Impressive performance. Victoria trained you well.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Not well enough,&quot; Camille replied quietly. &quot;I still haven&#x27;t figured out why you&#x27;re targeting us specifically.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Perhaps I simply enjoy the game,&quot; he suggested.<br/><br/>&quot;No. This is personal for you. Just as it&#x27;s personal for Rose.&quot;<br/><br/>Something flickered in his eyes, surprise that she had made the connection. &quot;You think you&#x27;ve won today,&quot; he said, his voice hardening. &quot;But you&#x27;ve merely delayed the inevitable.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Have I?&quot;<br/><br/>Herod smiled thinly. &quot;Kane Industries was built by Victoria. Without her, it&#x27;s nothing but an empty shell waiting to collapse.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Then why do you look so disappointed?&quot; Camille asked.<br/><br/>Before he could respond, she turned away. When she looked back, Herod was already walking down the steps, phone pressed to his ear.<br/><br/>The rest of the meeting proceeded smoothly. Stock prices began recovering as news spread through financial networks. By conclusion, Kane Industries shares had regained most of their recent losses.<br/><br/>In Victoria&#x27;s office afterward, Camille finally allowed herself to exhale. Hannah joined her, bringing coffee.<br/><br/>&quot;You destroyed him out there,&quot; Hannah said admiringly. &quot;You reminded me of Victoria.&quot;<br/><br/>The comparison warmed Camille more than she cared to admit. &quot;Speaking of whom, I should call her with an update.&quot;<br/><br/>After Hannah left, Camille looked out over the city where sections of the Phoenix Grid now powered thousands of homes and businesses. Somewhere, Rose and Herod were regrouping.<br/><br/>She replayed Herod&#x27;s words: *Kane Industries was built by Victoria. Without her, it&#x27;s nothing but an empty shell waiting to collapse.*<br/><br/>Not true, she told herself. Yet she wondered, was she truly leading, or merely following Victoria&#x27;s instructions? Had she proven herself today, or simply executed someone else&#x27;s plan?<br/><br/>Her phone rang, Alexander.<br/><br/>&quot;I heard what happened,&quot; he said. &quot;Congratulations. The stock is up seven points since the meeting ended.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Herod miscalculated,&quot; Camille replied. &quot;He thought I wouldn&#x27;t be able to respond to technical challenges.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;He underestimated you. A mistake I suspect he won&#x27;t make again.&quot;<br/><br/>After they disconnected, Camille remained at the window. Today she had protected Victoria&#x27;s company, defended her vision. It should have felt like a triumph.<br/><br/>Instead, she found herself wondering, when would she stop fighting Victoria&#x27;s battles and start defining her own? When would Camille Kane become more than Victoria Kane&#x27;s chosen weapon?</p><p></p></div>
