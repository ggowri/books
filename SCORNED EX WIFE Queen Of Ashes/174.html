        <h1>Chapter 115-2</h1>
        <div><br/>&quot;Camille,&quot; she murmured, her voice rough and faint.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m here,&quot; Camille repeated, squeezing her hand gently. &quot;The surgery was successful. They got the entire tumor.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s gaze drifted around the room, taking in her surroundings with growing awareness. &quot;How long?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Just over four hours,&quot; Camille told her. &quot;Dr. Lin said there was less spread than they feared. Your prognosis is excellent.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria nodded slightly, the movement clearly requiring effort. &quot;The company?&quot;<br/><br/>Even now, even here, Victoria&#x27;s thoughts turned to Kane Industries. Camille almost smiled.<br/><br/>&quot;Everything is under control,&quot; she assured her. &quot;Section B of the Grid is fully operational. The stock price is stable. I&#x27;ve updated the board that your procedure was successful and you&#x27;re resting.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Good,&quot; Victoria whispered. Her eyelids drooped, the medication still heavy in her system.<br/><br/>Camille leaned closer. &quot;Victoria,&quot; she said softly. &quot;I read your notes.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s eyes opened again, fixing on Camille&#x27;s face with surprising clarity.<br/><br/>&quot;I need to tell you something,&quot; Camille continued, her voice catching. &quot;Something I should have said before.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria waited, a rare patience in her gaze.<br/><br/>&quot;You saved me,&quot; Camille said simply. &quot;Not just from Rose and Stefan. Not just from being destroyed. You saved me from becoming like them, someone who only takes, who only ruins what others build.&quot;<br/><br/>She paused, gathering courage for the words that mattered most. &quot;When my own mother chose Rose over me, you chose me. You saw me when no one else did. You became...&quot;<br/><br/>Camille&#x27;s voice faltered, tears threatening again. &quot;You became my mother. Not by blood, but by everything that matters.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s fingers tightened around hers with unexpected strength. For a moment, Camille feared she had gone too far, crossed a boundary that Victoria would never permit. But when she met Victoria&#x27;s eyes, she saw something she had never witnessed before—tears gathering at the corners, making the gray irises shine in the dim light.<br/><br/>&quot;I know,&quot; Victoria whispered.<br/><br/>Just those two words, but they held everything Camille needed to hear. Victoria knew. She understood. She accepted the bond between them, not mentor and student, not benefactor and recipient, but mother and daughter in the ways that truly mattered.<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s eyes began to close again, the medication pulling her back toward sleep. &quot;Stay,&quot; she murmured, her grip on Camille&#x27;s hand loosening as consciousness slipped away.<br/><br/>&quot;I will,&quot; Camille promised. &quot;As long as you need me.&quot;<br/><br/>She sat with Victoria as her breathing deepened into sleep, watching the steady rise and fall of her chest. Through the window, sunlight had begun to break through the clouds, casting a warm glow across the bed.<br/><br/>After some time, Camille wasn&#x27;t sure how long, a quiet knock sounded at the door. Alexander entered, carrying two cups of fresh coffee.<br/><br/>&quot;How is she?&quot; he asked, handing Camille one of the cups.<br/><br/>&quot;Sleeping now,&quot; Camille replied. &quot;But she woke briefly. She knew me. Asked about the company, of course.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander smiled. &quot;Some things never change.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Did you tell her?&quot; he asked after a moment.<br/><br/>Camille nodded, her eyes still on Victoria&#x27;s sleeping face. &quot;Yes. And she...&quot; She paused, remembering the shine of tears in Victoria&#x27;s eyes, the simple acknowledgment that had meant everything. &quot;She already knew.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander pulled a chair beside Camille&#x27;s, sitting close enough that their shoulders touched. &quot;What happens now?&quot;<br/><br/>Camille took a sip of her coffee, organizing her thoughts. &quot;Victoria will need time to recover, then begin immunotherapy. We keep running Kane Industries according to her directives. And we prepare for whatever Rose and Herod are planning.&quot;<br/><br/>She turned to him, a new fire lighting her eyes. &quot;But we don&#x27;t just defend anymore. We attack.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander studied her face. &quot;You&#x27;re different today.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Am I?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; He gestured toward Victoria. &quot;Yesterday, you were terrified of losing her. Of being left to face everything alone. Today...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Today I know she&#x27;ll live,&quot; Camille finished. &quot;And that changes everything.&quot;<br/><br/>She stood, moving to the window to look out at the city sprawled below them. Somewhere out there, Rose and Herod were plotting, believing Victoria Kane was simply suffering from exhaustion, unaware that Camille now stood ready to protect everything Victoria had built.<br/><br/>&quot;We need to identify their next move,&quot; she said. &quot;The stock purchases, the technical probes, those are just the beginning. Herod wants Kane Industries. Rose wants to destroy me. They won&#x27;t stop until they get what they want.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Or until we stop them,&quot; Alexander added, coming to stand beside her.<br/><br/>Camille nodded, her reflection in the glass showing a woman transformed, no longer just Victoria&#x27;s creation, but something new. Someone who had found her own strength, her own purpose.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ll need your help,&quot; she said quietly.<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s hand found hers, their fingers intertwining. &quot;You have it. Always.&quot;<br/><br/>Behind them, Victoria slept on, her breathing deep and regular, each rise and fall of her chest a silent victory. The machines beeped steadily, marking the rhythm of her survival.<br/><br/>Camille turned back to look at her, the woman who had become her mother in every way that mattered. For twenty five months, Camille had followed Victoria&#x27;s lead, learning from her, becoming what Victoria shaped her to be. Now, for the first time, their roles would reverse. Camille would protect Victoria, would guard her secret, would fight her battles while she healed.<br/><br/>The thought no longer terrified her. Instead, it filled her with a fierce determination that burned brighter than any desire for revenge ever had.<br/><br/>&quot;We should go,&quot; she said softly. &quot;There&#x27;s work to do.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander nodded, understanding in his eyes. As they moved toward the door, Camille paused for one last look at Victoria. In sleep, the formidable CEO of Kane Industries looked almost peaceful, the lines of command and control softened by vulnerable humanity.<br/><br/>&quot;Rest,&quot; Camille whispered. &quot;Recover your strength. I&#x27;ll handle everything until you return.&quot;<br/><br/>She closed the door quietly behind them, her mind already racing with plans and strategies. Victoria Kane had survived. Now it was Camille&#x27;s turn to ensure that everything Victoria valued survived as well, her company, her legacy, and most importantly, her vision for the future they would build together.<br/><br/>Mother and daughter, not by blood, but by choice. By strength. By love.<br/></div>
