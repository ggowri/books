        <h1>Chapter 62-2</h1>
        <div><br/>Rebecca materialized at Camille&#x27;s side. &quot;Ms. Kane, Mr. Harrington is asking about your bid on the Wyeth painting. He seems quite determined to outbid you.&quot;<br/><br/>A perfect exit. Camille turned to her parents with her practiced smile. &quot;Duty calls. It was a pleasure meeting you both.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The pleasure was ours,&quot; Richard replied automatically, already scanning the room.<br/><br/>But Margaret caught Camille&#x27;s arm lightly. The unexpected contact sent a shock through Camille&#x27;s system......How many times had her mother reached for her exactly this way?<br/><br/>&quot;I hope we&#x27;ll have a chance to speak again,&quot; Margaret said quietly. &quot;Perhaps at the Metropolitan Museum gala next month? I believe Kane Industries usually sponsors a table.&quot;<br/><br/>Not social politeness but a deliberate attempt to establish another meeting. Another opportunity to solve the puzzle Camille represented.<br/><br/>&quot;Perhaps,&quot; she managed, withdrawing her arm. &quot;Though my schedule stays rather unpredictable.&quot;<br/><br/>Margaret nodded, apparently satisfied. &quot;Until next time, then.&quot;<br/><br/>As Camille walked away, she felt her mother&#x27;s gaze following her. Rebecca kept pace beside her, murmuring low.<br/><br/>&quot;That was dangerous. Victoria would not have approved.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Victoria isn&#x27;t here,&quot; Camille repeated, though her earlier confidence had faltered. &quot;And sometimes risks yield valuable information.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What information did you gain besides confirming they don&#x27;t recognize you?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;My mother senses something. Not recognition, exactly. More like... familiarity she can&#x27;t place.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;All the more reason to avoid further contact,&quot; Rebecca pointed out. &quot;If she begins asking questions...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;She already has questions,&quot; Camille interrupted. &quot;The question is what she&#x27;ll do with them.&quot;<br/><br/>The evening continued, Camille performing her role flawlessly, bidding on auction items, making small talk with business contacts, donating an additional fifty thousand dollars. Throughout it all, she maintained awareness of her parents, careful to keep adequate distance.<br/><br/>They left early, her father checking his watch with familiar impatience. As they made their way toward the exit, Camille saw her mother pause, turning to scan the room one last time. Their eyes met briefly across the crowd.<br/><br/>Margaret offered a small, puzzled smile before allowing her husband to guide her out. That smile, so familiar, so maternal despite the absence of recognition, sent unexpected pain through Camille&#x27;s chest.<br/><br/>&quot;Are you alright?&quot; Rebecca asked, noticing the momentary slip in Camille&#x27;s expression.<br/><br/>&quot;Fine,&quot; Camille replied automatically. &quot;Just tired.&quot;<br/><br/>Later, in her private car, Camille finally allowed herself to process the emotions she&#x27;d carefully contained. Seeing her parents up close. Hearing their voices. Speaking with them as a stranger while memories of a shared lifetime echoed in her mind.<br/><br/>It should have felt triumphant, standing before them as Camille Kane, wealthy and powerful. They hadn&#x27;t recognized the daughter they&#x27;d sacrificed for Rose&#x27;s happiness. Hadn&#x27;t seen past the surgical alterations to the woman who had once been their younger child.<br/><br/>Instead, she felt hollow. Empty in a way that Victoria&#x27;s coaching hadn&#x27;t prepared her for.<br/><br/>Her phone buzzed with a text from Alexander: *I heard the Lewis family attended tonight. Are you okay?*<br/><br/>How did he always know? How did he always sense exactly what was happening beneath her controlled exterior?<br/><br/>*Fine,* she texted back, the lie automatic. Then, surprising herself: *No. Not really.*<br/><br/>His response came immediately: *Sometimes the most painful wounds are the ones that don&#x27;t bleed. I&#x27;m here if you need to talk.*<br/><br/>Camille stared at the message, throat tight with emotions she&#x27;d thought safely buried. Her parents hadn&#x27;t recognized her. Had spoken with her, and seen only Camille Kane, Victoria&#x27;s mysterious daughter, a business connection worth cultivating. Not the child they&#x27;d raised.<br/><br/>It should have hurt less than Stefan&#x27;s destruction or Rose&#x27;s betrayal. They were her parents, but they&#x27;d made their choice long ago, chosen the daughter who played their social games perfectly over the one who never quite fit their expectations.<br/><br/>So why did this cut so deeply? Why did her mother&#x27;s puzzled almost-recognition hurt more than if she&#x27;d shown no interest at all?<br/><br/>The car approached Victoria&#x27;s mansion, security lights illuminating the manicured grounds. Inside the massive entry hall, silence greeted her. Victoria was in Tokyo. The house staff had retired. For the first time in months, Camille found herself truly alone with her thoughts.<br/><br/>She moved to the study, pouring herself a measure of expensive scotch. The familiar burn helped steady her nerves as she sank into a leather chair, kicking off her heels with relief.<br/><br/>Victoria would be furious about tonight&#x27;s interaction. Would see it as an unnecessary risk to their carefully constructed narrative. To the revenge plan they&#x27;d executed with precision.<br/><br/>But something about seeing her parents about her mother&#x27;s puzzled scrutiny had awakened questions Camille had buried. What was she really achieving with this elaborate revenge? Was destroying Stefan&#x27;s company and Rose&#x27;s reputation truly healing the wounds they&#x27;d inflicted? Or was she simply creating new scars to layer over the old ones?<br/><br/>Her phone buzzed again. Alexander: *Sometimes returning to who we were means facing those who knew us then. It doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re weak. It means you&#x27;re human.*<br/><br/>Camille set down her glass, his words touching something raw inside her. Victoria had trained her to be perfect, untouchable, a weapon of precise destruction. Alexander seemed to see the human beneath, the woman still capable of being wounded by a mother&#x27;s puzzled gaze.<br/><br/>She scrolled through her phone to the secret album she rarely viewed. Photos from before, Camille Lewis smiling with highschool friends. Camille Lewis on her wedding day. Camille Lewis with her parents at her highschool graduation, their arms around her shoulders, pride evident in their expressions.<br/><br/>A family that no longer existed. Parents who now chatted politely with the stranger their daughter had become.<br/><br/>Margaret&#x27;s words echoed: &quot;You remind me of someone. I can&#x27;t quite place who.&quot;<br/><br/>What would happen if her mother did place it? If she looked at Camille Kane one day and suddenly saw Camille Lewis beneath the surgical alterations? Would there be joy at discovering her daughter lived? Hurt at the deception?<br/><br/>Camille closed the photo album. Tonight had opened doors better left shut, awakened questions she wasn&#x27;t ready to answer. Victoria would say she was losing focus, allowing sentiment to cloud their revenge strategy.<br/><br/>Perhaps she was right.<br/><br/>But as Camille moved through the silent mansion toward her suite, she couldn&#x27;t shake the image of her mother&#x27;s puzzled expression. The feeling that somewhere, buried beneath years of manipulation and favoritism, some essential connection remained, some maternal instinct that recognized something familiar in a stranger&#x27;s face.<br/><br/>In her bathroom, Camille removed her makeup, studying her transformed features in the mirror. Dr. Torres had done masterful work, the changes subtle enough to appear natural while significant enough to create a new identity.<br/><br/>And yet...<br/><br/>As she removed the last traces of mascara, Camille could almost see Camille Lewis peering through Camille Kane&#x27;s eyes. The woman she&#x27;d been still lived somewhere inside the woman she&#x27;d become.<br/><br/>She pulled out her phone again, staring at Alexander&#x27;s message. He alone seemed to understand the war raging beneath her carefully maintained façade.<br/><br/>*You were right,* she texted finally. *Facing the past is harder than I expected.*<br/><br/>His response came immediately: *The phoenix rises from ashes, but first it must acknowledge what burned. Sleep well, Camille. Tomorrow brings new choices.*<br/><br/>As she slipped into bed, Camille wondered what choices tomorrow might bring. Whether the glimpse of her parents would strengthen her resolve for revenge or weaken it. Whether her mother&#x27;s puzzled recognition would deepen into true understanding.<br/><br/>And what she would do if Margaret Lewis looked at her someday and said the words that would shatter everything: &quot;Camille? Is it really you?&quot;<br/><br/>Sleep claimed her before she found an answer, dreams filling with her mother&#x27;s searching eyes and the whispered question that followed her into darkness: &quot;Why do I know you?&quot;<br/></div>
