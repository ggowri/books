        <h1>Chapter 181-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 181<br/><br/>The penthouse was quiet when Camille arrived home. Only the kitchen light glowed, spilling onto the polished floor. She found Alexander at the island counter, papers spread before him, a glass of whiskey at his elbow. The amber liquid caught the light as he raised it, not looking up when she entered.<br/><br/>&quot;Long day?&quot; he asked, still scanning the document in front of him.<br/><br/>Camille set her bag down, her heart beating faster. The weight of Eleanor Pierce&#x27;s visit pressed on her shoulders. &quot;You could say that.&quot;<br/><br/>She moved to the refrigerator, buying time as she pulled out a bottle of water. Her mind raced, searching for the right words. How do you tell someone their estranged mother showed up after seven years of silence?<br/><br/>&quot;Someone came to see me today,&quot; she said, her voice quieter than she intended.<br/><br/>Alexander made a noncommittal sound, still absorbed in his work.<br/><br/>&quot;At the office.&quot; Camille twisted the cap off her water. &quot;Your mother.&quot;<br/><br/>The stillness that followed was absolute. Alexander&#x27;s hand froze mid-turn of a page. His shoulders stiffened under his dress shirt. When he finally looked up, his eyes had turned to ice.<br/><br/>&quot;My mother,&quot; he repeated, his voice flat. &quot;Eleanor Pierce came to your office.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes. This afternoon.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander set his glass down with careful precision. &quot;And what did my mother want after seven years of silence?&quot;<br/><br/>The coldness in his voice sent a chill through Camille. This was a side of Alexander she rarely saw, the hard edge beneath his usual warmth.<br/><br/>&quot;She wants to see you. To talk.&quot; Camille moved closer, resting her hands on the counter. &quot;She says she and your father need to apologize.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander laughed, a sharp sound with no humor in it. &quot;Apologize. That&#x27;s rich.&quot; He stood abruptly, the stool scraping against the floor. &quot;Did she tell you why they might need to apologize? Did she share that particular story?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Some of it,&quot; Camille said carefully. &quot;About the accident. About James.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;About how they chose to believe my brother instead of me?&quot; Alexander&#x27;s voice rose slightly. &quot;About how they visited him daily while I was learning to walk again? About how they helped him avoid charges while I went through three surgeries alone?&quot;<br/><br/>He turned away, moving to the window. Outside, the city sparkled in the darkness, a thousand lights against the night sky.<br/><br/>&quot;Alexander...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No.&quot; His voice cut through the room. &quot;Whatever else she told you, whatever she asked, the answer is no. I&#x27;m not interested.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille took a slow breath. &quot;She mentioned James&#x27;s death. Your father&#x27;s stroke.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s reflection in the window showed no reaction, but his knuckles whitened where he gripped the sill.<br/><br/>&quot;She said they tried to reach you. That they came to your apartment after James&#x27;s funeral.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;They did,&quot; Alexander said coldly. &quot;With his confession letter in hand. Four years too late.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You knew about the letter?&quot; Camille asked, surprised.<br/><br/>&quot;Of course I knew,&quot; Alexander said, turning to face her. &quot;They sent it by courier after I refused to see them. I sent it back unopened.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille moved toward him, stopping when he took a step back. &quot;She brought a photo. Of you as a child. Winning a sailing competition.&quot;<br/><br/>Something flickered across his face, pain, quickly masked by anger. &quot;She kept my baby pictures. How touching.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Alexander, please...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Please what, Camille?&quot; His voice was dangerously calm now. &quot;Please meet with the people who abandoned me when I needed them most? Please give them absolution so they can sleep better at night? I already refused when my father had his stroke last month. What makes you think I&#x27;ve changed my mind?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You knew about your father&#x27;s stroke?&quot; Camille asked.<br/><br/>&quot;Their lawyer contacted me. Said my father had collapsed after seeing our engagement announcement. That he was asking for me.&quot; Alexander&#x27;s expression hardened. &quot;I told him my father made his choice seven years ago. I was simply honoring it.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No.&quot; Camille held his gaze steadily. &quot;Please listen. Just listen to what I have to say.&quot;<br/><br/>For a moment, she thought he would refuse. Then he gave a curt nod, moving back to the counter and his abandoned whiskey.<br/><br/>&quot;Your mother came alone. She didn&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d see her. She didn&#x27;t demand anything.&quot; Camille chose her words with care. &quot;She said they failed you. Those were her words, that they failed you when you needed them most.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander stared into his glass, saying nothing.<br/><br/>&quot;She said forgiveness would be too much to ask. She just wants a chance to apologize in person. To acknowledge the truth.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Why now?&quot; The question came quietly, some of the ice melting from his voice. &quot;Why keep trying after all these years? After I&#x27;ve made it abundantly clear I want nothing to do with them?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;She said they were afraid. Ashamed.&quot; Camille took a step closer, relieved when he didn&#x27;t pull away. &quot;Your father struggled to accept what they&#x27;d done, that they&#x27;d chosen to believe lies.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander drained his glass, setting it down with a sharp click. &quot;My father, struggling with his precious pride. That sounds about right.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;But they&#x27;re here now,&quot; Camille said. &quot;Still trying to make amends.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No.&quot; Alexander shook his head. &quot;They&#x27;re here now because they&#x27;re getting older. Because James is gone and they&#x27;re facing their own mortality. They want absolution before it&#x27;s too late.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Maybe,&quot; Camille conceded. &quot;Does that make their regret less real?&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander pushed away from the counter, pacing the length of the kitchen. His movements reminded Camille of a caged animal, powerful and restless.<br/><br/>&quot;You don&#x27;t understand what it was like,&quot; he said finally. &quot;James was always their golden child. The star athlete, the popular one, the son who could do no wrong. When the accident happened...&quot; His voice caught. &quot;I kept telling them he&#x27;d been drinking. That he&#x27;d insisted on driving even though I offered to call a cab. That he&#x27;d laughed when I asked him to slow down.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille stayed silent, letting him speak.<br/><br/>&quot;They looked me in the eye.... their son, in a hospital bed with pins in my leg.... and told me I must be confused. That James said I had wanted to drive but he stopped me because I&#x27;d had too much to drink.&quot; Alexander&#x27;s laugh was bitter. &quot;James, the responsible one. James, who would never lie.&quot;<br/><br/>He stopped at the refrigerator, pulling out the whiskey bottle and refilling his glass. &quot;Did she tell you that part? How they chose to believe I was lying rather than face the truth about their precious firstborn?&quot;</div>
