        <h1>Chapter 168</h1>
        <div><p>Chapter 168<br/><br/>Stefan paced the length of the makeshift command center, running his hands through his hair for the hundredth time. The room buzzed with activity, Alexander&#x27;s security team, FBI agents, police liaisons, all working frantically to find Camille. Twenty-six hours had passed since her abduction. Twenty-six hours of dead ends and false leads.<br/><br/>&quot;This isn&#x27;t working,&quot; Stefan muttered, stopping at the map where pins marked locations they&#x27;d already searched. &quot;We&#x27;re missing something. Rose wouldn&#x27;t just take her anywhere.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander looked up from a table covered with files, dark circles under his eyes. &quot;Every property connected to Rose or her aliases has been searched. Twice.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s not about property records,&quot; Stefan said, something nagging at the back of his mind. &quot;It&#x27;s about meaning. Rose does everything with purpose. She&#x27;d want somewhere that... that connects to their past.&quot;<br/><br/>He closed his eyes, trying to focus. Images flashed through his mind: Camille showing him old family photos, telling stories of her childhood. Stories from before Rose came into their lives.<br/><br/>&quot;Wait,&quot; Stefan said suddenly, the memory sharpening. &quot;The Lewis summer cabin. Cedar Lake.&quot;<br/><br/>The room fell silent.<br/><br/>&quot;What cabin?&quot; Alexander asked, standing up straight.<br/><br/>Stefan grabbed his phone, dialing with shaking fingers. &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Lewis might know. They had a vacation property when Camille was young.&quot;<br/><br/>Within twenty minutes, Richard and Margaret Lewis rushed into the command center, their faces lined with worry. Margaret clutched a photo album to her chest like a shield.<br/><br/>&quot;Cedar Lake,&quot; Richard confirmed, his voice rough with emotion. &quot;We had a cabin there for years. Sold it to the Hendersons when Rose turned sixteen. She never quite fit in there, it was Camille&#x27;s special place first.&quot;<br/><br/>Margaret opened the album with trembling hands, revealing photos of a young Camille standing proudly on a wooden dock, fishing rod in hand. &quot;We taught her to swim in that lake. Richard would sit on the dock for hours with her, fishing.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And the cabin itself?&quot; Alexander pressed, leaning forward intensely.<br/><br/>&quot;Two bedrooms, stone fireplace,&quot; Margaret said, flipping to another photo that showed the cabin&#x27;s rustic interior. &quot;Camille carved her initials in the mantel when she was eight. I was so angry at the time.&quot; Her voice broke. &quot;Now I&#x27;d give anything to see those marks again.&quot;<br/><br/>Richard pointed to the fireplace in the photo. &quot;That stone was brought from a local quarry. The builder told us it would &#x27;last through anything.&#x27; Outlast us all, he said.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Rose was obsessed with the place,&quot; Margaret added, her eyes distant with memory. &quot;After we sold it, she kept asking to go back. Said it was the only place she felt like a real part of the family.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander snapped his fingers at his head of security. &quot;Check property records for Cedar Lake. Focus on recent transactions involving the Henderson family.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We checked all Lewis family properties,&quot; an FBI agent said, frowning.<br/><br/>&quot;Not if it changed hands recently,&quot; Stefan countered. &quot;Rose plans for everything. She could have purchased it from whoever owns it now.&quot;<br/><br/>Hands flew over keyboards. Minutes ticked by. Stefan resumed his pacing, while Margaret continued turning pages in the photo album, tears silently tracking down her face.<br/><br/>&quot;Were there any distinctive features?&quot; Alexander asked. &quot;Anything that would help us identify it if Rose has modified it?&quot;<br/><br/>Richard nodded slowly. &quot;There was a boathouse, painted blue. And a cluster of three pine trees right at the water&#x27;s edge. Lightning struck one, split it right down the middle, but it kept growing. Camille called it the &#x27;twin tree.&#x27;&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Got something,&quot; called a woman at a computer terminal. &quot;Cedar Lake property, previously owned by the Henderson family, sold one month ago to Phoenix Rising LLC.&quot; She looked up, her expression grim. &quot;Registered agent is R. Thornton.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Thornton,&quot; Margaret gasped. &quot;That was Rose&#x27;s last name in the foster system, before we adopted her.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;One month ago,&quot; Alexander repeated, his voice tight. &quot;She&#x27;s been planning this for weeks.&quot;<br/><br/>The analyst continued, &quot;Cash transaction. Sale price well above market value, suggesting urgency.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander leaned over the screen. &quot;Send me those coordinates. What&#x27;s the satellite view show?&quot;<br/><br/>The image appeared on the main display screen: a cabin nestled in dense woods, a narrow dirt road leading to it, a small dock extending into the lake behind it. And at the water&#x27;s edge, the unmistakable silhouette of three tall pines, one with a distinctive split trunk.<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s it,&quot; Richard said, his voice thick with emotion. &quot;That&#x27;s our cabin.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria, who had been sitting quietly in the corner, conserving her strength during her cancer recovery, leaned forward. &quot;What&#x27;s the satellite thermal imaging show?&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s security chief stepped forward. &quot;Heat signatures show at least three people inside. One hasn&#x27;t moved from this room in hours.&quot;<br/><br/>A cold weight settled in Stefan&#x27;s stomach. &quot;Camille.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And this figure here moves between rooms. Likely Rose.&quot; The security chief pointed to another blip on the thermal imaging. &quot;Third signature stays mostly by the entrance. Probably a guard.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander turned to his team, his face set in hard lines. &quot;I want schematics, approach routes, extraction plans. We move tonight.&quot;<br/><br/>The room erupted into focused activity.<br/><br/>Stefan watched as Alexander pored over maps with his head of security, marking entry points and escape routes. He felt useless, an outsider in this operation of professionals.<br/><br/>&quot;I never truly saw her, you know,&quot; Stefan said quietly when Alexander paused near him. &quot;Not until it was too late.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s eyes were cold. &quot;Which one?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Either of them. Camille was... good. Genuinely good. I didn&#x27;t value that.&quot; Stefan swallowed hard. &quot;And Rose.... I never saw the darkness in her. The obsession.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Save your confession for later,&quot; Alexander said, turning back to the maps. &quot;The only thing that matters now is getting Camille out alive.&quot;<br/><br/>An hour passed as they refined the plan. The property sat isolated, three miles from the nearest neighbor. Satellite images showed minimal security, Rose had relied on secrecy rather than force for protection.<br/><br/>&quot;We have a problem,&quot; the security chief announced after a call. &quot;Storm front moving in. Helicopter approach impossible in these conditions. We&#x27;ll need to go in by ground, and the only road is likely watched.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What about by water?&quot; Stefan asked, studying the map. &quot;The lake touches the property line here.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;There&#x27;s a hidden inlet,&quot; Richard added, pointing to the satellite image. &quot;Behind those trees. You can barely see it from the cabin. We used to keep a rowboat there.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander considered it. &quot;Small boats. Silent approach. Two teams, one from the road as a distraction, one from the water for extraction.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria pushed herself to her feet, her face pale but determined. &quot;I&#x27;m coming with you.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Absolutely not,&quot; Alexander said firmly. &quot;You&#x27;re still recovering.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I wasn&#x27;t asking permission.&quot; Victoria&#x27;s voice held the steel that had built her empire. &quot;I&#x27;ll stay in the support vehicle. But I will be there when you bring her out.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander looked as if he might argue, then nodded once. &quot;Stefan stays with you.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No,&quot; Stefan protested. &quot;I need to help. I know the cabin. Camille described it to me in detail.&quot;<br/><br/>A tense silence filled the room. Finally, Alexander spoke. &quot;Fine. You go in with the water team. But you follow orders precisely, or I&#x27;ll have you removed. Understood?&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan nodded, relief and fear battling within him.<br/><br/>Margaret approached Stefan, pressing something into his hand. It was a small wooden fishing lure, weathered with age. &quot;Camille made this at the cabin when she was ten,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Give it to her. Tell her we&#x27;re waiting for her to come home.&quot;<br/><br/>The next two hours passed in a blur of preparation. Tactical gear was distributed. Communications tested. Weapons checked and loaded.<br/><br/>&quot;Remember,&quot; Alexander told the assembled team, &quot;Rose is mentally unstable but extremely intelligent. She&#x27;ll have contingency plans. Our priority is Camille&#x27;s extraction. Rose&#x27;s capture is secondary.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And if she resists?&quot; asked one of the tactical officers.<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s expression darkened. &quot;Then you do what&#x27;s necessary to protect Camille.&quot;<br/><br/>As the teams prepared to move out, Stefan found himself standing next to Victoria. The formidable woman who had helped Camille transform from victim to phoenix looked unexpectedly fragile, but her eyes burned with fierce determination.<br/><br/>&quot;I failed her,&quot; Stefan said quietly.<br/><br/>Victoria didn&#x27;t look at him. &quot;Yes. You did.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I won&#x27;t fail her again.&quot;<br/><br/>Now Victoria turned, studying his face. &quot;Do you know why she chose you in the first place, before Rose&#x27;s manipulation?&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan shook his head.<br/><br/>&quot;Because she saw something in you worth loving. Something beyond the surface.&quot; Victoria&#x27;s voice was cold but not cruel. &quot;Prove her right. For once.&quot;<br/><br/>The loading bay doors opened. Outside, rain had begun to fall, the droplets catching in the harsh light of the security floodlights.<br/><br/>Alexander stood at the threshold, checking his tactical vest one last time. His face no longer showed the polished businessman Camille had come to love, but a hunter focused only on his prey.<br/><br/>&quot;Vehicles move out in five minutes,&quot; he announced. &quot;Water team, thirty minutes to launch point. Road team, we&#x27;ll position at the perimeter in forty-five minutes and wait for the signal.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria touched Alexander&#x27;s arm. &quot;Bring her home.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I will.&quot; He glanced at the storm clouds gathering overhead. &quot;Whatever it takes.&quot;<br/><br/>As they moved toward the waiting vehicles, Stefan felt a strange calm settle over him. For the first time since his betrayal of Camille, he knew exactly what he had to do. Not for forgiveness, he&#x27;d long stopped hoping for that but for redemption.</p><p></p></div>
