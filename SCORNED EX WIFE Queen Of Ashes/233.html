        <h1>Chapter 150-2</h1>
        <div><br/>Without hesitation, Alexander tapped his earpiece. &quot;Jason, potential explosives in the building. Lock down all service areas immediately. Full sweep, starting with support columns and infrastructure.&quot; He turned back to Stefan. &quot;Where exactly did you see this?&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan described the location, watching as Alexander relayed the information to his security team. Within moments, dark-suited men were discreetly moving toward service doors around the ballroom perimeter.<br/><br/>&quot;We need to evacuate,&quot; Stefan said.<br/><br/>Alexander shook his head. &quot;Not yet. If we cause a panic, Rose wins. We need to find the devices first, confirm they&#x27;re real.&quot; He checked his watch. &quot;Camille is about to give her keynote speech. Keep this quiet until we know more.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And if they are real?&quot; Stefan pressed.<br/><br/>&quot;Then we have evacuation protocols ready.&quot; Alexander&#x27;s expression was grim. &quot;Thank you for the alert. Stay close in case you recognize anyone else suspicious.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander moved back into the crowd, his posture casual but his movements purposeful. Stefan watched him gather his security team leaders for quiet instructions, all while maintaining the appearance that nothing was wrong.<br/><br/>On the stage, the master of ceremonies approached the microphone.<br/><br/>&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome back to the stage the Executive Director of the Phoenix Foundation, Ms. Camille Kane, who will deliver tonight&#x27;s keynote address.&quot;<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Rose and Mikhail met in the basement corridor as planned. His face showed satisfaction, he had placed all three devices successfully.<br/><br/>&quot;Any problems?&quot; Rose asked.<br/><br/>&quot;None.&quot; His thick accent wrapped around the word. &quot;All set for big boom.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose checked her watch. &quot;Thirty-four minutes until detonation. We need to be well clear by then.&quot; She handed him the security guard&#x27;s radio. &quot;Keep this. We&#x27;ll know if they discover the devices.&quot;<br/><br/>As they turned toward the service exit, the radio crackled to life. &quot;All security personnel, Code Bravo. Repeat, Code Bravo. Immediate sweep of all service areas. Potential suspicious packages.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose and Mikhail exchanged alarmed looks. Someone had spotted them.<br/><br/>&quot;We go now,&quot; Mikhail said urgently. &quot;Different exits.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose nodded. &quot;Meet at the backup location in one hour.&quot; She could hear footsteps coming from multiple directions now. Security would have every exit covered soon.<br/><br/>&quot;What about devices?&quot; Mikhail asked. &quot;They will find.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose smiled, cold and confident despite her racing heart. &quot;That&#x27;s why we had backups planted yesterday. They&#x27;re hidden too well to be found in time.&quot;<br/><br/>Even if security found these six devices, they wouldn&#x27;t find the others. The ones already in place. The ones set to detonate during Camille&#x27;s speech.<br/><br/>&quot;Go,&quot; she ordered Mikhail, turning in the opposite direction. As she ran, Rose imagined the scene above, Camille taking the stage, smiling at the adoring crowd, completely unaware that her moment of triumph was about to become her greatest tragedy.<br/><br/>Thirty-two minutes until the foundation she had built crumbled around her.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Camille approached the podium, smiling as applause filled the ballroom. From her elevated position, she could see nearly all eight hundred guests, the flash of expensive jewelry under crystal chandeliers, the expectant faces turned toward her.<br/><br/>She could also see Alexander moving around the perimeter of the room, speaking urgently into his earpiece. Something was wrong. But the microphone was already live, her speech about to begin.<br/><br/>Victoria sat at the head table, looking pale but proud. Whatever was happening, Camille couldn&#x27;t show alarm. Couldn&#x27;t let the crowd sense any danger. She had learned that much from Victoria, appearances mattered, especially in crisis.<br/><br/>She took a deep breath and began.<br/><br/>&quot;Distinguished guests, generous donors, dear friends. Tonight represents not just the launch of the Phoenix Foundation, but the beginning of a new chapter for survivors of abuse across this country.&quot;<br/><br/>As she spoke, Camille noticed more security personnel entering the ballroom, moving with controlled urgency toward service doors and exits. Stefan stood near Alexander now, both men looking grim.<br/><br/>Still, she continued, keeping her voice steady despite the growing knot of fear in her stomach.<br/><br/>&quot;The phoenix rises from ashes, transformed by fire into something stronger, more beautiful. That transformation is what we offer to women who have lost everything, their safety, their confidence, their hope.&quot;<br/><br/>Through the bright lights, Camille could see Alexander receiving information through his earpiece, his expression darkening. Security teams were fanning out across the ballroom now, some kneeling to check under tables, others examining the walls and support columns.<br/><br/>They were looking for something. Something dangerous.<br/><br/>Rose. It had to be Rose.<br/><br/>Despite the realization, Camille&#x27;s voice remained strong, her words clear. She wouldn&#x27;t give Rose the satisfaction of seeing her falter.<br/><br/>&quot;Tonight, as we gather in celebration, I&#x27;m reminded of my own journey. Of the moments when I thought I couldn&#x27;t go on. When the pain and betrayal seemed too much to bear.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille locked eyes with Victoria, drawing strength from the woman who had saved her, who had taught her to transform pain into power. Victoria nodded slightly, a signal to continue despite whatever was happening behind the scenes.<br/><br/>&quot;But I did go on. We all do. And with your help, countless women will find the strength to rise from their own ashes, to rebuild their lives brick by brick, to discover the power that has always existed within them.&quot;<br/><br/>The ballroom erupted in applause, but Camille barely heard it. Her focus remained split between her speech and the increasingly frantic movements of security personnel. Something was very wrong. She could feel it in the air, thick with tension that only she and a few others seemed to notice.<br/><br/></div>
