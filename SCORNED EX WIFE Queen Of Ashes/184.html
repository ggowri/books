        <h1>Chapter 121-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 121<br/><br/>Rose hurled the crystal glass across the penthouse. It shattered against the wall in a spray of liquid and glittering shards. On the television screen, Camille and Alexander stood side by side at their press conference, hands joined, faces composed, turning what should have been their greatest humiliation into a triumph.<br/><br/>&quot;How?&quot; Rose screamed at the screen. &quot;How is this happening?&quot;<br/><br/>She grabbed the remote, increasing the volume to hear her sister&#x27;s voice, calm, dignified, unashamed: *&quot;Yes, Alexander Pierce and I are in a relationship. It began recently, but it is genuine and important to both of us.&quot;*<br/><br/>Genuine. Important. The words burned in Rose&#x27;s ears like acid. This was not how it was supposed to go. Camille should have been destroyed by this exposure, her reputation in tatters, her position at Kane Industries compromised. Instead, she stood there with perfect poise, Alexander at her side, accepting no blame, showing no weakness.<br/><br/>Rose grabbed another glass, ready to send it flying, when the penthouse door opened. Herod entered, his face a thundercloud of barely contained rage. He tossed his phone onto the coffee table, where it displayed the Kane Industries stock ticker, up eight points and climbing.<br/><br/>&quot;They&#x27;ve turned it around completely,&quot; he said, his voice dangerously quiet. &quot;The market is responding positively to their announcement. The financial documents we planted are being questioned by every major outlet.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I can see that,&quot; Rose snapped, gesturing to the television where financial analysts were now discussing the &quot;Kane-Pierce power alliance&quot; with enthusiasm. &quot;They&#x27;re practically celebrating them!&quot;<br/><br/>Herod loosened his tie with sharp, angry movements. &quot;Victoria. This has her fingerprints all over it. Only she would have the audacity to turn a scandal into a strategic announcement.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose paced across the penthouse, unable to contain the energy coursing through her. &quot;I planned this perfectly,&quot; she hissed. &quot;The photos, the timing, the fake emails, it should have destroyed them both!&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yet here we are,&quot; Herod said, pouring himself a drink from the bar. He didn&#x27;t offer Rose one, knowing she was beyond such niceties now. &quot;Our strategy has not only failed but backfired spectacularly.&quot;<br/><br/>On the screen, the camera showed Camille and Alexander leaving the press conference together. The commentator&#x27;s voice gushed: *&quot;In an age of spin and denial, the directness of Kane and Pierce&#x27;s approach has resonated deeply with the public. Social media is overwhelmingly supportive, with many praising their honesty and courage in the face of what appears to be a targeted attack.&quot;*<br/><br/>&quot;Turn it off,&quot; Rose demanded, her voice shaking with fury. &quot;Turn it off now.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod obliged, the screen going black, leaving only their reflections staring back at them, Rose with her hair disheveled from running her hands through it repeatedly, Herod still outwardly composed but with rage simmering beneath the surface.<br/><br/>&quot;This was your strategy,&quot; he reminded her, a dangerous edge to his voice. &quot;Your expertise in social manipulation. Your certainty that exposing their relationship would destroy them.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose whirled on him. &quot;Don&#x27;t you dare blame this all on me! You approved every step. You provided the resources, the connections to get those photos, to plant those documents.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Which we&#x27;ve now wasted,&quot; Herod replied coldly. &quot;Hundreds of thousands of dollars for what? To make your sister and Pierce more popular than ever? To strengthen Kane Industries&#x27; stock position?&quot;<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s hands curled into fists, nails digging into her palms hard enough to leave half-moon marks. &quot;It should have worked,&quot; she insisted. &quot;No one recovers from a scandal like this. No one.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Apparently, they do.&quot; Herod drained his glass. &quot;The question is, what now? Our opening move has failed. We&#x27;ve lost the element of surprise. They&#x27;ll be watching for our next attack.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose walked to the floor-to-ceiling windows, staring out at the city lights. Somewhere out there, Camille was probably celebrating her victory, laughing with Alexander about how they had turned Rose&#x27;s attack against her. The thought made her stomach twist with hatred.<br/><br/>&quot;We need something bigger,&quot; she said, her breath fogging the glass. &quot;Something they can&#x27;t spin into a positive.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Such as?&quot; Herod asked, his reflection appearing behind her in the window.<br/><br/>Rose turned to face him. &quot;Victoria. She&#x27;s their weak point. Remove her from the equation, and Camille loses her guide, her mentor, her backup plan.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Victoria Kane is untouchable,&quot; Herod said dismissively. &quot;We&#x27;ve been through this.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No one is untouchable,&quot; Rose insisted, a new fire burning in her eyes. &quot;Everyone has secrets. Everyone has vulnerabilities. We just haven&#x27;t found hers yet.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod studied her for a long moment. &quot;You truly hate her, don&#x27;t you? Your sister.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;She&#x27;s not my sister,&quot; Rose snapped automatically. &quot;And hate doesn&#x27;t begin to describe what I feel for her.&quot;<br/><br/>She moved closer to Herod, energy radiating from her in waves. &quot;Camille took everything from me. My reputation, my business, my future. She exposed me to the world as a fraud, a cheat, a villain. And now she gets to stand there with her Trillionaire boyfriend and her perfect new life while I&#x27;m the one hiding in shadows?&quot;<br/><br/>Her voice rose with each word, trembling with rage, with injustice, with the bitter taste of defeat. &quot;I will not accept this. I will not let her win. Not after everything I&#x27;ve sacrificed, everything I&#x27;ve endured.&quot;</div>
