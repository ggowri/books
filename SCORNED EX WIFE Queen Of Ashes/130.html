        <h1>Chapter 90-2</h1>
        <div><br/>The room erupted again as reporters shouted questions.<br/><br/>Margaret raised her hand for quiet. &quot;We have one final statement. To our daughter, Camille.&quot; She looked directly into the camera. &quot;We failed you. We chose Rose over you. We didn&#x27;t believe you when you needed us most. There aren&#x27;t enough words to express our regret.&quot;<br/><br/>Richard joined her. &quot;We love you, Camille. We understand if you can never forgive us, but know that we are proud of the woman you&#x27;ve become, with or without our help.&quot;<br/><br/>In Victoria&#x27;s office, Camille covered her mouth to stifle a sob.<br/><br/>Victoria silently offered a handkerchief, her expression uncharacteristically soft.<br/><br/>&quot;Turn it off,&quot; Camille said suddenly.<br/><br/>Victoria muted the television but left the images running. &quot;This changes everything. The narrative is shifting already.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille stared at the silent footage. &quot;Why? After everything, why would they do this?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;For the same reason most people do anything,&quot; Victoria replied. &quot;Because they realized what they stood to lose.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille shook her head. &quot;No. They&#x27;ve already lost me.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Perhaps. Or perhaps they finally understand that some things matter more than pride.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille&#x27;s phone began buzzing incessantly. Victoria switched channels to the business network where an anchor was reporting: &quot;...extraordinary reversal as Kane Industries stock surges following the Lewis family press conference...&quot;<br/><br/>The office door flew open as Victoria&#x27;s assistant rushed in. &quot;The Phoenix Grid partners are calling to reaffirm their commitment! And the board members who voted against Camille are requesting an emergency meeting!&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria smiled. &quot;Tell them I&#x27;ll consider their request after our stock fully recovers.&quot;<br/><br/>The assistant nodded and retreated. Victoria turned to Camille, whose attention remained fixed on her parents leaving the podium.<br/><br/>&quot;What are you thinking?&quot; Victoria asked softly.<br/><br/>&quot;I don&#x27;t know what to feel,&quot; Camille admitted. &quot;Grateful? Angry? It doesn&#x27;t erase what they did.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No,&quot; Victoria agreed. &quot;But it does complicate your neat categories of ally and enemy.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander checked his phone. &quot;The market&#x27;s already responding positively.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;How did my parents get all that evidence against Rose?&quot; Camille asked.<br/><br/>&quot;I may have had my team compile some files,&quot; Alexander admitted. &quot;Your father was surprisingly receptive.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille&#x27;s phone rang, her mother&#x27;s number flashing on the screen. She stared at it, frozen.<br/><br/>&quot;You don&#x27;t have to answer,&quot; Victoria said.<br/><br/>&quot;If I do, everything changes again.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We stick to the plan. Rose and Herod destroyed. Clean. Final.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes,&quot; Victoria repeated. &quot;But plans can evolve.&quot;<br/><br/>The ringing stopped. The call went to voicemail.<br/><br/>Camille opened her eyes. &quot;They stood up for me.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;They did.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;After everything Rose did, they finally chose me.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria nodded. &quot;The question is: does it matter?&quot;<br/><br/>Camille looked at the television where analysts were predicting Kane Industries&#x27; full recovery. Her parents&#x27; actions had saved more than her reputation, they&#x27;d protected everything she and Victoria had built.<br/><br/>&quot;I don&#x27;t know yet,&quot; she answered honestly.<br/><br/>Her phone chimed with a voicemail notification. Victoria rose from her desk. &quot;I&#x27;ll give you privacy. There are decisions only you can make.&quot;<br/><br/>As Victoria left, Camille sat alone with her phone. Outside, she could hear the office buzzing with activity. Kane Industries would survive. The Phoenix Grid would proceed.<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s plan had failed.<br/><br/>But the greater question remained as Camille stared at her mother&#x27;s name on the screen. After years of pain, after rebuilding herself, after finding a new mother in Victoria, could she open the door to her past?<br/><br/>Her finger hovered over the voicemail icon.<br/><br/>On the television, Rose&#x27;s face appeared briefly, shocked and furious as reporters surrounded her, shouting questions about the accusations.<br/><br/>The sight strengthened something in Camille. She pressed the voicemail button and raised the phone to her ear.<br/><br/>&quot;Camille,&quot; Margaret began, her voice breaking. &quot;We&#x27;ve said what needed saying publicly. But there&#x27;s so much more I need to tell you privately. If you&#x27;re willing to listen.&quot;<br/><br/>The message ended with a soft, &quot;We love you. We always have. Even when we failed to show it.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille lowered the phone, her chest tight with emotion she couldn&#x27;t name. Not forgiveness, not yet. But perhaps something like possibility.<br/><br/>Outside Victoria&#x27;s office, the world was reshaping itself. Rose exposed. Camille vindicated. Kane Industries recovering.<br/><br/>But inside, in the quiet space between heartbeats, Camille faced the most difficult question: Who did she want to be when the dust settled? The woman who got her revenge, or the woman who built something new from the ashes?<br/><br/>She looked at her phone, then at Rose surrounded by reporters, and finally at her own reflection in Victoria&#x27;s darkened screen.<br/><br/>Three versions of herself, three possible futures.<br/><br/>The choice was hers alone.<br/></div>
