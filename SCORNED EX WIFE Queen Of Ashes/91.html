        <h1>Chapter 67-2</h1>
        <div><br/>&quot;ROSE LEWIS SCANDAL DEEPENS: FORMER CLASSMATE PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF DESIGN THEFT&quot;<br/><br/>Accompanying the headline was a photo of Rose from her fashion school days, standing proudly beside what had been her breakthrough design, a design that, according to the article, had been stolen from a fellow student who never received credit.<br/><br/>Stefan scrolled through the story, a strange numbness spreading through him. Every new revelation about Rose should have shocked him, but instead, each one simply confirmed what he now understood. The woman he had believed himself in love with, the woman he had been prepared to marry, had never actually existed. She had been a character played by a skilled manipulator who saw people as stepping stones to what she wanted.<br/><br/>And what was most disturbing wasn&#x27;t how thoroughly she had fooled him, but how easily he had allowed himself to be fooled.<br/><br/>When had he become this man? This gullible, shallow person who had discarded a genuine wife for the flashier, more calculated attention of her sister? When had ambition and appearance begun to matter more than substance and truth?<br/><br/>The questions burned through the alcohol haze, demanding answers he wasn&#x27;t ready to face.<br/><br/>Stefan signaled for another drink, needing to dull the sharp edges of his self-recrimination. The bartender hesitated, clearly weighing his professional responsibility against the desperation in Stefan&#x27;s eyes.<br/><br/>&quot;Last one,&quot; he said firmly, pouring a smaller measure than before. &quot;Then I&#x27;m calling you a car.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan didn&#x27;t argue. He had lost the right to make good decisions for himself somewhere between signing divorce papers on his anniversary and watching Kane Industries systematically dismantle his family company.<br/><br/>Kane Industries. The name triggered something in his foggy mind. A connection he had been trying to make for days now. Victoria Kane had no history in shipping, no previous interest in Rodriguez Shipping assets. Yet her company had moved with surgical precision to acquire their debt, seize their assets, and block every attempt at recovery.<br/><br/>Why? What had prompted such targeted destruction?<br/><br/>And more puzzling was her daughter, Camille Kane. The mysterious heiress who had appeared less than two years ago, with no background information beyond vague references to a European education. The woman whose dark eyes had seemed almost familiar when they had briefly met at that charity function months ago.<br/><br/>There was something there, some connection he couldn&#x27;t quite grasp through the whiskey fog. Some explanation for why Kane Industries had singled out Rodriguez Shipping for such complete destruction.<br/><br/>&quot;Time to go, Mr. Rodriguez.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan looked up, surprised to find the bartender standing before him with his coat. The bar was empty now, the couple in the corner long gone, the night pressing dark against the windows.<br/><br/>&quot;What time is it?&quot; Stefan asked, voice rough from whiskey and silence.<br/><br/>&quot;Nearly two. And you&#x27;ve had enough.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan nodded, not trusting himself to stand without assistance. The bartender&#x27;s steady hand helped him to his feet, guided him into his coat, and steered him toward the door.<br/><br/>&quot;Your car&#x27;s outside. Already paid for.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Thanks,&quot; Stefan managed, fumbling in his pocket for his wallet. &quot;Let me....&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s covered.&quot; The bartender waved away his attempt to pay. &quot;Someone called. Said to put it on their account.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan frowned, confused. &quot;Who?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Didn&#x27;t say. Just that you shouldn&#x27;t be driving.&quot;<br/><br/>The mystery benefactor was probably his father, still monitoring him despite being ignored all evening. The thought should have annoyed him, but instead, it simply added to the weight of failure pressing down on his shoulders. Even now, Eduardo Rodriguez was taking care of problems his son couldn&#x27;t handle alone.<br/><br/>Outside, rain fell steadily, turning the city streets into rivers of reflected light. A black town car waited at the curb, driver standing patiently beside the open rear door. Not his father&#x27;s usual service, Stefan noted distantly. Something more expensive. More discreet.<br/><br/>&quot;Mr. Rodriguez,&quot; the driver said with a slight nod. &quot;Where can I take you tonight?&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan hesitated. Not back to the empty penthouse he had shared with Rose, still filled with her things despite her hasty departure days ago. Not to the family estate that now belonged to Kane Industries. Not to the Seattle offices where his presence would only remind everyone of how far the mighty Rodriguez Shipping had fallen.<br/><br/>&quot;Just... drive,&quot; he said finally, sliding into the car&#x27;s leather interior. &quot;Anywhere.&quot;<br/><br/>The driver nodded again, closing the door and returning to the wheel without further questions. The car pulled smoothly into the rain-slicked street, wipers creating a hypnotic rhythm against the windshield.<br/><br/>Stefan leaned back against the seat, letting exhaustion and alcohol pull him toward unconsciousness. The car moved smoothly through nearly empty streets, wipers still keeping their steady beat. Stefan felt consciousness slipping away despite his attempt to understand the strange events of recent weeks.<br/><br/>As sleep finally claimed him, his mind still wrestled with unanswered questions. Why had Kane Industries targeted him so precisely? What had triggered such a thorough destruction of everything he valued? And why did he still feel there was something important he was missing, some connection just beyond his grasp?<br/><br/>The car continued its journey through the rain-washed city, carrying its unconscious passenger toward a destination neither of them yet knew.<br/></div>
