        <h1>Chapter 102-2</h1>
        <div><br/>&quot;Now I find myself thinking about you. Not just about our plan. About you.&quot; His fingers lingered at her jawline. &quot;About your mind. Your determination. Your willingness to do whatever it takes to get what you want.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose had manipulated men all her life. Stefan had been easy—weak, easily swayed by flattery and attention. But Herod was different. Sharper. More dangerous.<br/><br/>And infinitely more interesting.<br/><br/>&quot;Those aren&#x27;t exactly romantic qualities,&quot; she said.<br/><br/>&quot;Aren&#x27;t they?&quot; The corner of his mouth lifted. &quot;I don&#x27;t want some fragile flower, Rose. I want an equal. Someone who understands that power is never given, it must be taken.&quot;<br/><br/>The words resonated deep within her. No one had ever seen her so clearly before. Not her adoptive parents, certainly not Stefan, and especially not Camille. They&#x27;d all wanted her to be something else, grateful, loving, supportive. None of them had valued the hunger that drove her.<br/><br/>But Herod did. He saw it, understood it, admired it.<br/><br/>&quot;And if I don&#x27;t want a partnership?&quot; she asked, testing him.<br/><br/>His eyes hardened slightly. &quot;Then we finish our plan. Destroy Kane Industries. Get our revenge. And part ways as... what? Successful co-conspirators?&quot;<br/><br/>The thought of walking away after it was done, of never seeing Herod again left an unexpected hollow feeling in Rose&#x27;s chest. She reached up, covering his hand with hers where it rested against her face.<br/><br/>&quot;And if I do want it?&quot; she asked softly.<br/><br/>Something flared in his eyes, triumph, desire, relief? Rose couldn&#x27;t tell. Before she could analyze it further, Herod leaned forward and pressed his lips to hers.<br/><br/>The kiss was nothing like she expected. Not calculated or controlling or cold. It was hungry, almost desperate, as if he&#x27;d been holding himself back for weeks. His hands slid into her hair, cradling her head as the kiss deepened.<br/><br/>Rose found herself responding with equal intensity, her fingers gripping the lapels of his expensive suit. For so long, she&#x27;d channeled all her passion into hatred, into destroying Camille. This new outlet for her emotions felt dangerously liberating.<br/><br/>When they finally broke apart, both breathing heavily, the storm outside had intensified. Rain lashed against the windows, and thunder rumbled through the sky.<br/><br/>&quot;Well,&quot; Herod said, his voice rougher than usual. &quot;I suppose that answers the question.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose laughed, a real laugh, without the bitterness that usually colored her humor. &quot;I&#x27;m not that easy to read.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No,&quot; he agreed, tucking her hair behind her ear. &quot;You&#x27;re not. That&#x27;s part of what fascinates me.&quot;<br/><br/>He led her to the black leather sofa facing the wall of windows. They sat close, the electricity between them almost as palpable as the lightning outside.<br/><br/>&quot;You know,&quot; Rose said, curling her legs beneath her, &quot;this complicates things.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;How so?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;When we started this, it was purely business. Revenge. Clean and simple.&quot; She traced a pattern on the leather between them. &quot;Now it&#x27;s...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Personal,&quot; he finished for her.<br/><br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; She looked up at him. &quot;Is that wise?&quot;<br/><br/>Herod considered her question, his fingers playing with a strand of her hair. &quot;Probably not,&quot; he admitted. &quot;But wisdom is overrated.&quot;<br/><br/>Their second kiss was slower, more deliberate, but no less intense. Rose found herself melting into it, into him, all thoughts of Camille and Victoria temporarily pushed aside. This wasn&#x27;t part of the plan, but maybe, just maybe, it could be part of something better.<br/><br/>Later, much later, they lay tangled together on Herod&#x27;s massive bed, watching the storm gradually subside through the bedroom windows. Rose&#x27;s head rested on his chest, his heartbeat steady beneath her ear.<br/><br/>&quot;What happens if something goes wrong?&quot; she asked suddenly. &quot;With the Grid, I mean.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod&#x27;s hand, which had been stroking her back, paused. &quot;Nothing will go wrong. The modifications are perfect.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;But if they find them somehow? If Camille or that engineer discovers what we&#x27;ve done?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;They won&#x27;t.&quot; His voice held absolute confidence. &quot;The changes are too subtle to catch unless someone knows exactly what to look for. And by the time anyone realizes something&#x27;s wrong, it will be too late.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose wanted to believe him. But she&#x27;d underestimated Camille before. Her sister had a way of surviving, of turning disaster into opportunity. Just as she had transformed from the broken woman signing divorce papers into Victoria Kane&#x27;s powerful heir.<br/><br/>&quot;We should have a backup plan,&quot; Rose insisted, propping herself up to look at him. &quot;Something else in motion, just in case.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod studied her face, then nodded slowly. &quot;You&#x27;re right. It&#x27;s good strategy.&quot;<br/><br/>He sat up, reaching for his robe on the bedside chair. &quot;Actually, I may already have something in mind. A contingency I&#x27;ve been developing.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Tell me,&quot; Rose said, wrapping the sheet around herself as she watched him move to the desk across the room.<br/><br/>Herod returned with a tablet, sitting beside her on the bed. He pulled up a file labeled &quot;Phoenix Gala&quot; and handed it to her.<br/><br/>&quot;What&#x27;s this?&quot; she asked, scrolling through what appeared to be security details and floor plans.<br/><br/>&quot;Kane Industries is planning a charity gala to celebrate the Phoenix Grid going live.&quot; His finger tapped the screen. &quot;All their key people will be there. Camille. Victoria. Alexander Pierce. The engineers. The board members.&quot;<br/><br/>Understanding dawned on Rose. &quot;The perfect target.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod nodded, a slow smile spreading across his face. &quot;If the Grid fails, wonderful. But if not...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We bring the disaster to them directly,&quot; Rose finished, a thrill running through her.<br/><br/>&quot;Exactly.&quot; He took the tablet back, setting it aside before pulling her close again. &quot;See? This is why we make such good partners. You anticipate. You prepare for all contingencies.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose smiled, settling against him. For the first time in longer than she could remember, she felt truly understood. Truly valued.<br/><br/>&quot;Partners,&quot; she repeated, liking how the word felt on her tongue.<br/><br/>Outside, the storm had passed. The city lights twinkled through the clearing sky, millions of people going about their lives, unaware of the destruction being planned in this high-rise sanctuary.<br/><br/>Rose closed her eyes, contentment washing over her. Soon Camille would lose everything. Victoria would watch her empire crumble. And Rose, Rose would finally win.<br/><br/>But now, she realized, victory would taste even sweeter. Because she wouldn&#x27;t be celebrating alone.<br/></div>
