        <h1>Chapter 137-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 137<br/><br/>Camille stared at the wall of screens in Kane Industries&#x27; crisis management room. Each one showed a different news channel, all broadcasting the same images: smoke pouring from the damaged substations, firefighters battling flames, and worried faces of New York citizens wondering if their power would fail next. Three hours had passed since the second explosion. The sun would rise soon, bringing with it questions they needed answers for.<br/><br/>&quot;The press is gathering downstairs,&quot; Hannah said, placing a tablet in front of Camille. &quot;Over forty reporters. All major networks.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded, her eyes never leaving the screens. The headline crawling across the bottom of Channel 7&#x27;s broadcast made her stomach clench: &quot;PHOENIX GRID FAILURE? KANE INDUSTRIES FACES QUESTIONS AFTER TWIN EXPLOSIONS.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Stock futures are dropping,&quot; Alexander added quietly from behind her. &quot;Down twelve percent already.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria, still pale from her recent surgery but standing straight-backed and defiant, turned to Camille. &quot;You need to address them. Now. Before the market opens.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille felt the weight of all eyes in the room. The engineering team. The security personnel. Victoria. Alexander. All waiting for her to fix this nightmare.<br/><br/>&quot;What do we know for certain?&quot; Camille asked, her voice steadier than she felt.<br/><br/>Hannah stepped forward. &quot;The Grid didn&#x27;t fail. Our safety systems worked exactly as designed. Despite two major attacks, ninety-three percent of the network remains operational.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And the power supply?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Stable. We&#x27;ve rerouted through secondary pathways. No service disruptions to critical infrastructure.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille stood, smoothing her blouse with trembling hands. &quot;I need five minutes to prepare. Then I&#x27;ll speak to them.&quot;<br/><br/>In the small bathroom off the crisis room, Camille splashed cold water on her face and stared at her reflection. Dark circles shadowed her eyes. Her skin looked pale under the harsh fluorescent light. Fear gnawed at her insides.<br/><br/>&quot;You can do this,&quot; she whispered to herself. &quot;You&#x27;ve faced worse than reporters.&quot;<br/><br/>But had she? Facing Rose&#x27;s betrayal, Stefan&#x27;s cruelty—those were personal wounds. This was different. The Phoenix Grid wasn&#x27;t just a business project. It represented everything she&#x27;d become since Victoria had rescued her. It was her rebirth, her transformation from victim to creator.<br/><br/>And now Rose was trying to destroy that too.<br/><br/>A soft knock interrupted her thoughts. Alexander stood in the doorway, his tie loose, his face tired but determined.<br/><br/>&quot;I thought you might need this,&quot; he said, handing her a small velvet box.<br/><br/>Inside lay her phoenix pendant, the one Victoria had given her at the beginning of her transformation. Camille touched it, feeling its weight, the smooth metal cool against her fingers.<br/><br/>&quot;I can&#x27;t fix this,&quot; she whispered, the admission tearing from her throat. &quot;Everything we built...&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander stepped closer, his hands gentle on her shoulders. &quot;You&#x27;re not fixing anything because nothing is broken. The Grid worked. The safety systems worked. We&#x27;re still standing.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;But the public perception...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Can be shaped.&quot; His eyes held hers. &quot;Remember who you are, Camille. You&#x27;ve survived worse than this.&quot;<br/><br/>She clasped the pendant around her neck, drawing strength from its familiar weight. The woman who had worn it when Victoria first gave it to her had been broken, desperate for revenge. The woman wearing it now had built something. Created something. And she wouldn&#x27;t let it be destroyed.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m ready,&quot; she said.<br/><br/>The press room buzzed with tension. Camera flashes exploded as Camille walked to the podium, her steps measured, her back straight. Dozens of reporters shouted questions, their voices blending into a wall of noise. Camille raised her hand, and gradually, silence fell.<br/><br/>&quot;Good morning,&quot; she began, her voice clear and unwavering. &quot;Last night, Kane Industries&#x27; Phoenix Grid substations were attacked in what authorities are investigating as acts of terrorism. I want to be clear: these were not accidents. These were not system failures. These were deliberate attacks designed to destroy what we have built.&quot;<br/><br/>She paused, scanning the room, meeting the gaze of several reporters directly.<br/><br/>&quot;They failed.&quot;<br/><br/>The simple statement hung in the air. A reporter from the Wall Street Journal broke the silence.<br/><br/>&quot;Ms. Kane, how can you claim they failed when two substations are completely destroyed?&quot;</div>
