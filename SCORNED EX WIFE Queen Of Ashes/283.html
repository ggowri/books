        <h1>Chapter 180-2</h1>
        <div><br/>&quot;What about his father?&quot; Camille asked.<br/><br/>&quot;Edward is a broken man. James&#x27;s death shattered him. Alexander&#x27;s refusal to acknowledge us destroyed what was left.&quot; Her voice hardened. &quot;Four years ago, Edward drove to Alexander&#x27;s building every day for three weeks. Just sat in his car, hoping for a glimpse.&quot;<br/><br/>She took a deep breath. &quot;Last month, when Edward saw your engagement announcement, he collapsed. Had a minor stroke. The doctor said it was stress, but I know it was grief. The realization that Alexander had built a new life we&#x27;d never be part of.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Please,&quot; Eleanor whispered, the word raw with desperation. &quot;I know we don&#x27;t deserve another chance. But Alexander deserves the truth. He deserves to hear us say he was right all along.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille walked to the window, giving Eleanor a moment. The rain was letting up, patches of evening sky visible between clouds.<br/><br/>&quot;After James died,&quot; she asked, &quot;did Alexander know he&#x27;d confessed? Did you tell him?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We tried,&quot; Eleanor said, her voice hollow. &quot;We went to his apartment the day after the funeral. Edward was in shock. I remember standing there, James&#x27;s letter in my hand, knocking until my knuckles bruised.&quot;<br/><br/>She closed her eyes. &quot;We sent James&#x27;s letter by courier the next day. It came back unopened. We tried his company, we tried through mutual friends, Alexander had made it clear he wanted nothing to do with us.&quot;<br/><br/>Eleanor looked down at her hands. &quot;The last time we actually spoke to him was at the hospital, during his final surgery. He looked at us with such emptiness. He said, &#x27;You&#x27;ve chosen. So have I.&#x27; He hasn&#x27;t spoken to us since. Seven years of silence.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And what would you say to him now? If I somehow convinced him to see you?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That I&#x27;m sorry. That I was wrong. That I&#x27;ve lived with that wrong choice every day.&quot; Eleanor&#x27;s voice strengthened with conviction. &quot;That a mother is supposed to protect her child, and I failed at the most fundamental duty. That I&#x27;ve missed him with a pain so physical I sometimes can&#x27;t breathe with it.&quot;<br/><br/>Her eyes met Camille&#x27;s, red-rimmed but steady. &quot;That I&#x27;m proud of the man he&#x27;s become, despite us, not because of us. That I understand if he can never forgive us, but I needed him to know that we finally faced the truth. That we know James lied. That Alexander was right.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And his father?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Edward can barely speak about Alexander without breaking down,&quot; Eleanor said quietly. &quot;He keeps a file of every news article. He follows all of Alexander&#x27;s companies, buys stock in each one.&quot; She gave a broken laugh. &quot;He has this absurd idea that somehow, if Alexander ever checked his shareholder records, he&#x27;d see his father&#x27;s name and know we still care.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Your engagement,&quot; Eleanor continued, &quot;it gave us hope. That perhaps Alexander could forgive, could rebuild after betrayal. The way you did with your parents.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille stiffened. &quot;You&#x27;ve been researching me.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Obsessively,&quot; Eleanor admitted without shame. &quot;You&#x27;re the woman our son loves. Of course we&#x27;ve learned everything about you we could.&quot; Her face softened. &quot;And what we learned gave us hope. You&#x27;ve overcome betrayal. You&#x27;ve reconciled with those who hurt you. You understand the possibility of redemption.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille thought of her own journey, of Victoria who had taught her the power of strategic thinking but was only now learning the strength in vulnerability. Of her own parents, who had asked for a second chance.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ll help you,&quot; she said finally. &quot;Not because you deserve it, but because Alexander deserves the choice. To hear you out or to send you away again, that should be his decision, made with all the facts.&quot;<br/><br/>Relief flooded Eleanor&#x27;s face. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she whispered.<br/><br/>&quot;But understand this,&quot; Camille continued, her voice firm. &quot;If he doesn&#x27;t want to see you, that&#x27;s the end of it. I won&#x27;t push him. And if you hurt him again in any way....&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I understand,&quot; Eleanor said. &quot;You&#x27;re protecting him as I failed to do. As you should.&quot;<br/><br/>She removed a small, worn photograph from her bag, placing it on the desk.<br/><br/>&quot;This is Alexander at eight,&quot; she said. &quot;The sailing competition he won that summer.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille looked down at the image of a grinning boy with windswept hair, holding a small trophy. His smile was uninhibited in a way she&#x27;d rarely seen on the adult Alexander.<br/><br/>&quot;He used to laugh all the time,&quot; Eleanor said, her voice thick with memory. &quot;The sound would fill the whole house. After the accident, after what we did...&quot; Her voice caught. &quot;I&#x27;ve never heard that laugh again. Except in that photo with you.&quot;<br/><br/>Eleanor rose to leave, her movements weighted with grief. &quot;Leave your contact details with my assistant,&quot; Camille said. &quot;I&#x27;ll speak with Alexander tonight.&quot;<br/><br/>Eleanor paused at the door. &quot;We named him after Alexander the Great,&quot; she said softly. &quot;Edward wanted a conqueror&#x27;s name. But all I ever wanted was for him to be happy.&quot; Her eyes, so like her son&#x27;s, met Camille&#x27;s one last time. &quot;Thank you for giving him that, at least. For helping him find joy again, even if it&#x27;s a joy we&#x27;ll never share.&quot;<br/><br/>After she left, Camille remained at the window, watching the city lights blink on as darkness fell completely. She thought of the conversation ahead with Alexander, of the rage it might unleash. Of wounds reopened and possibly, just possibly, finally beginning to heal.<br/><br/>She had promised to help Eleanor Pierce. Now she had to find the wisdom to help Alexander too, whatever path he chose to take. Her fingers traced the edge of the childhood photograph, this evidence of happiness before pain. She wondered if such uncomplicated joy could ever truly be reclaimed, or if the best any of them could hope for was to build something new from the broken pieces.<br/></div>
