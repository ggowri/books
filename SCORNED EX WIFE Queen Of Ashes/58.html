        <h1>Chapter 48-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 48<br/><br/>Rose point of view<br/><br/>The showroom that had once been my pride now felt like a tomb. Silent. Empty. Abandoned. I moved between the clothing racks, touching fabrics that represented thousands of hours of work. My spring collection,  the one fashion critics had called &quot;boundary-pushing&quot; and &quot;career-defining&quot; just weeks ago, hung untouched, unsold, unwanted.<br/><br/>My phone buzzed for the twentieth time that morning. Another cancellation, no doubt. Another buyer pulling orders. Another door slamming shut.<br/><br/>I ignored it, continuing my lonely tour through what remained of my empire. The front desk sat vacant, I&#x27;d had to let Jessica go yesterday, along with three other staff members. The remaining team worked from home now, making desperate calls to salvage what business they could.<br/><br/>The quiet made the memories louder. The launch party for this collection just two months ago. Champagne flowing. Music pulsing. Fashion editors praising my &quot;visionary aesthetic.&quot; Buyers from luxury stores around the world competing for exclusive pieces.<br/><br/>All gone.<br/><br/>In the back office, financial reports covered my desk in a sea of red numbers. The phone rang again, my lawyer&#x27;s name flashing on the screen. I answered this time, bracing for more bad news.<br/><br/>&quot;Rose,&quot; Mark&#x27;s voice carried the careful tone people use with the terminally ill. &quot;Neiman Marcus just pulled their entire order.&quot;<br/><br/>My fingers tightened on the phone. Neiman had been my biggest supporter from the beginning. Their spring order represented nearly a million dollars in revenue.<br/><br/>&quot;They can&#x27;t do that,&quot; I said, struggling to keep my voice steady. &quot;We have a contract.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;They&#x27;re invoking the morality clause. Paragraph sixteen, section B. The same one Saks used yesterday.&quot;<br/><br/>Another blow. Another cut. I sank into my chair, legs suddenly unable to support my weight.<br/><br/>&quot;What about Bergdorf?&quot; I asked, though I already knew the answer from his silence.<br/><br/>&quot;Their email came five minutes ago. I was about to call you.&quot;<br/><br/>Three major department stores in twenty-four hours. Each one citing the same &quot;reputational concerns&quot; after the photos of me with Anton Bessonov had spread through every fashion publication.<br/><br/>&quot;What about the spring production run?&quot; I asked, mind racing to find some path forward. &quot;We&#x27;ve already started manufacturing.&quot;<br/><br/>Mark hesitated. &quot;That&#x27;s the other thing. Stellar Fabrics called this morning. They&#x27;re canceling delivery of the materials.&quot;<br/><br/>The room tilted sideways. Stellar was our main supplier. Without their specialized fabrics, we couldn&#x27;t produce anything, not the spring collection, not even basic pieces to keep cash flowing.<br/><br/>&quot;They can&#x27;t back out!&quot; My voice rose despite my efforts to remain calm. &quot;We prepaid half the order!&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;They&#x27;re refunding the deposit, but the contract has the same morality clause as the others. Rose, someone went through your agreements very carefully. Every major partner has the same exit provision.&quot;<br/><br/>Ice spread through my veins. This wasn&#x27;t bad luck or coincidence. This was planned. Executed with precision by someone who wanted to destroy me completely.<br/><br/>&quot;Who would do this, Mark? Who wants to ruin me?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It could be any competitor in the industry. Fashion is....&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No,&quot; I cut him off. &quot;This feels personal. The timing of the photo leaks. The coordination of the contract cancellations. Someone is orchestrating this.&quot;<br/><br/>Mark sighed. &quot;I&#x27;ve reached out to my contacts at the other fashion houses. No one seems to know where the photos originated. They just appeared simultaneously on multiple blogs, like they were seeded deliberately.&quot;<br/><br/>My mind raced through possibilities. Jealous designers? Industry rivals? Former lovers with grudges? The list of people I&#x27;d stepped on to reach the top wasn&#x27;t short.<br/><br/>&quot;Has anyone unusual been asking questions about me? Anyone new in the industry who might have something against me?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Not that I know of. But Rose, we need to focus on saving what&#x27;s left of the business. If we can secure bridge financing...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;There won&#x27;t be a business left to save if we don&#x27;t identify who&#x27;s attacking us!&quot; I slammed my hand on the desk, sending financial reports fluttering to the floor. &quot;Someone didn&#x27;t just happen to find those photos. Someone went looking for them. Someone who knew exactly where to search.&quot;<br/><br/>As if responding to my outburst, the office door opened. My assistant Michael stood there, face pale.<br/><br/>&quot;What now?&quot; I demanded, already knowing from his expression it wasn&#x27;t good.<br/><br/>&quot;Vogue just pulled your feature.&quot; His voice trembled slightly. &quot;And Harper&#x27;s Bazaar is asking for comment about... about the Russian money laundering allegations.&quot;<br/><br/>The room spun around me. The Vogue feature had been scheduled for months, a six-page spread celebrating my &quot;authentic creative vision.&quot; Now gone. And money laundering? The accusation felt like a physical blow.<br/><br/>&quot;What allegations?&quot; Mark asked sharply.<br/><br/>Michael handed me his tablet. On screen, a financial blog I&#x27;d never heard of detailed suspicious transactions between Anton Bessonov&#x27;s accounts and my early business funding. Transactions I&#x27;d thought were buried, hidden, forgotten.<br/><br/>&quot;This is insane,&quot; I whispered, scanning the article. &quot;These records were private. How did anyone get access?&quot;<br/><br/>But I already knew the answer. Someone with resources. Someone with connections. Someone determined to ruin me.</div>
