        <h1>Chapter 118-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 118<br/><br/>Rose stared at the laptop screen, a smile spreading across her face as she scrolled through the photographs. The yacht had been easy to find once Herod&#x27;s investigators had traced Alexander&#x27;s movements. Getting someone with a telephoto lens onto a nearby boat had been even easier.<br/><br/>&quot;Perfect,&quot; she whispered, zooming in on a particularly intimate image of Camille and Alexander on the deck of his yacht. Her sister, not that she deserved that title anymore, locked in an embrace with the billionaire, their kiss leaving nothing to the imagination.<br/><br/>The penthouse suite Herod had secured for her sparkled with morning light, illuminating dozens of photos and documents spread across the glass table. Three empty coffee cups testified to her sleepless night of preparation.<br/><br/>Her phone buzzed. Herod.<br/><br/>&quot;Are you watching the financial news?&quot; he asked without preamble.<br/><br/>&quot;No,&quot; Rose replied, still scrolling through the photos. &quot;I&#x27;ve been busy with our little project.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Kane Industries stock jumped twelve points after yesterday&#x27;s meeting,&quot; Herod said, frustration sharpening his voice. &quot;Your sister completely dismantled my safety concerns. Made me look like a fool.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose switched to speaker phone and set it down. &quot;She&#x27;s not my sister. And don&#x27;t worry about yesterday. By this afternoon, no one will be talking about the Phoenix Grid anymore.&quot;<br/><br/>She selected nine photos, each more damning than the last. Camille and Alexander kissing. Camille in his arms at the railing. The two of them disappearing below deck, then emerging later with unmistakable signs of what they&#x27;d been doing.<br/><br/>&quot;The photos are ready?&quot; Herod asked.<br/><br/>&quot;Better than we hoped.&quot; Rose moved them to a separate folder. &quot;The lighting is perfect. No question about who they are. No possibility of claiming they&#x27;re doctored.&quot;<br/><br/>She heard Herod&#x27;s approving chuckle. &quot;And the other material?&quot;<br/><br/>Rose clicked to another folder containing documents, emails, and financial records, some real, most fabricated by the expert Herod had hired.<br/><br/>&quot;All prepared,&quot; she confirmed. &quot;The story writes itself. Alexander Pierce, using Camille Kane to gain control of Victoria&#x27;s company through the bedroom rather than the boardroom.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Which outlets are you sending them to?&quot;<br/><br/>Rose picked up a handwritten list. &quot;New York Spectator gets the exclusive on the photos. They&#x27;ll reach the widest audience fastest. The financial documents go to the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg simultaneously, more credible sources for that angle.&quot;<br/><br/>She checked her watch. &quot;The Spectator will run the photos online at noon. The financial pieces will hit the wire services an hour later, just as everyone is talking about the scandal.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Excellent.&quot; Herod&#x27;s voice carried grudging admiration. &quot;I underestimated your media instincts.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I lived with these people for seven years,&quot; Rose reminded him. &quot;I know exactly how to manipulate public perception. It was my specialty, remember?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Don&#x27;t get too confident,&quot; Herod warned. &quot;Your sister has proven remarkably resilient.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;She won&#x27;t recover from this,&quot; Rose said, certainty hardening her voice. &quot;Victoria Kane values control above all else. The suggestion that Camille is compromised by a relationship with a business rival, letting emotions cloud her judgment, that strikes at the heart of everything Victoria believes in.&quot;<br/><br/>She clicked through the photos again, savoring each one. &quot;Victoria may have accepted Camille as her heir, but she&#x27;ll never tolerate this kind of vulnerability. Not with Alexander Pierce of all people.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Why does that name matter specifically?&quot; Herod asked.<br/><br/>Rose smiled, pleased to know something Herod didn&#x27;t. &quot;Victoria and Alexander have history. Years ago, Pierce Industries tried to acquire a shipping company Victoria wanted. He outmaneuvered her, and Victoria never forgives anyone who beats her.&quot;<br/><br/>She pulled up another document, an old news clipping showing Victoria Kane looking coldly at Alexander across a conference table. &quot;Victoria sees him as a threat. Always has.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;All the better for our purposes,&quot; Herod said thoughtfully.<br/><br/>Rose stood and stretched, moving to the floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Central Park. &quot;How much more do you need to buy?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;With what I already have secretly through shell companies, another fifteen percent would give me effective control,&quot; Herod replied. &quot;The remaining shareholders are scattered, disorganized. They&#x27;ll follow whoever holds the largest block.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose nodded, watching a jogger far below. &quot;And when you control Kane Industries?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We dismantle it,&quot; Herod said simply. &quot;Sell off the profitable divisions, shut down the rest. Including the Phoenix Grid.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And Camille?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Publicly humiliated. Professionally destroyed. Exactly what you wanted.&quot;</div>
