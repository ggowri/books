        <h1>Chapter 68-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 68<br/><br/>The executive boardroom of Kane Industries buzzed with restrained energy as financial analysts and legal experts gathered around the massive oak table. All eyes focused on the presentation screen where Fabio Moretti&#x27;s company logo, Moretti Global Logistics, dominated the display.<br/><br/>Victoria Kane sat at the head of the table, silver hair swept into her signature severe bun. To her right, Camille Kane studied the financial projections, occasionally making notes on her tablet.<br/><br/>&quot;Mr. Howard, please begin,&quot; Victoria said, nodding to the head of acquisitions.<br/><br/>Daniel Howard cleared his throat. &quot;Moretti Global Logistics is the primary shipping partner for Rose Lewis Designs, or what remains of it. They handle eighty-seven percent of the brand&#x27;s global transportation needs, plus warehousing and fulfillment.&quot;<br/><br/>He clicked to the next slide showing a world map dotted with distribution centers. &quot;Moretti has built impressive infrastructure across twenty-three countries, specializing in high-end fashion logistics. Their client list includes Chanel, Versace, and numerous luxury brands.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And their financial situation?&quot; Victoria prompted.<br/><br/>&quot;Overleveraged,&quot; Howard replied, advancing to a declining profit graph. &quot;They expanded aggressively last year, taking on significant debt. With Lewis Designs&#x27; collapse, they&#x27;ve lost thirty percent of expected revenue. Their stock has dropped eighteen percent in the past week alone.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria turned to legal. &quot;Ms. Chen, the ownership structure?&quot;<br/><br/>Eleanor Chen opened her folder. &quot;Fifty-one percent owned by Fabio Moretti himself. Twenty-two percent public shareholders. The remaining twenty-seven percent held by various private investors, including a fifteen percent stake belonging to Rose Lewis, who joined their board last year.&quot;<br/><br/>A murmur ran through the room. Victoria silenced it with a glance before turning to her daughter.<br/><br/>&quot;Camille, your assessment?&quot;<br/><br/>All eyes shifted to the younger Kane, who set down her tablet with deliberate care.<br/><br/>&quot;Moretti Global represents a strategic opportunity on multiple levels,&quot; Camille began coolly. &quot;First, their infrastructure complements our existing holdings. Second, their client relationships give us immediate entry into luxury fashion shipping. Third, their vulnerability makes this the optimal moment to acquire them below market value.&quot;<br/><br/>She paused, meeting her mother&#x27;s gaze. &quot;And fourth, Fabio Moretti is Rose Lewis&#x27;s godfather and most loyal business ally. The last person still standing beside her.&quot;<br/><br/>The significance settled over the room. Everyone understood this wasn&#x27;t purely business. This was personal, another calculated move in the systematic dismantling of Rose Lewis&#x27;s world.<br/><br/>&quot;Thank you, Camille,&quot; Victoria said. &quot;Mr. Howard, the takeover strategy?&quot;<br/><br/>Howard clicked to a flowchart. &quot;We&#x27;ve prepared a two-pronged approach. First, quietly acquire available public shares through subsidiaries. Simultaneously, approach private investors, excluding Ms. Lewis, with offers fifteen percent above current value.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And Moretti himself?&quot; Victoria asked.<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s where we&#x27;ll face resistance,&quot; Howard admitted. &quot;He&#x27;s known for loyalty. His connection to the Lewis family goes back decades. He&#x27;s unlikely to sell willingly.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria turned to research. &quot;Dr. Patel, what vulnerabilities have you identified?&quot;<br/><br/>Dr. Patel touched her tablet, bringing new information to the screen.<br/><br/>&quot;Fabio Moretti has three pressure points. First, his son Marco&#x27;s struggling startup has been kept afloat through his father&#x27;s cash infusions. Second, Moretti Global&#x27;s expansion into South America encountered regulatory issues that could be reopened. Third, his youngest daughter is launching a fashion brand next season and needs manufacturing and distribution partners.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Excellent,&quot; Victoria said. &quot;Leverage without anything too aggressive.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Implementation timeline?&quot; she asked Howard.<br/><br/>&quot;We could have controlling interest within thirty days.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria shook her head. &quot;Too slow. Rose Lewis resigned yesterday. The embezzlement evidence becomes public tomorrow. Moretti will be preparing contingency plans. We need to move faster.&quot;<br/><br/>She turned to Chen. &quot;Legal implications of an immediate tender offer?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;d pay a premium and telegraph our intentions, but there&#x27;s no legal obstacle.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria nodded. &quot;Prepare the offer at twenty percent above current value, contingent on acceptance within forty-eight hours.&quot;<br/><br/>She looked around the table. &quot;Any other considerations?&quot;<br/><br/>Camille spoke. &quot;Fabio Moretti has been a second father figure to Rose since childhood. Taking his company will hit her differently than other business losses. This is personal for her.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria studied her daughter. &quot;Does that concern you?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No,&quot; Camille replied steadily. &quot;Just an observation. We should prepare for a more emotional response than her previous losses triggered.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria stood. &quot;I want the tender offer ready by market close. And ensure Ms. Lewis&#x27;s stake is completely isolated in the new structure. I want her investment rendered worthless.&quot;<br/><br/>The executives filed out, leaving Victoria and Camille alone.<br/><br/>&quot;You&#x27;re quiet,&quot; Victoria observed. &quot;Having second thoughts?&quot;<br/><br/>Camille shook her head. &quot;No. Just appreciating the precision of it all. How each piece fits so perfectly into the larger strategy.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria smiled slightly. &quot;Like chess. The key is thinking multiple moves ahead while your opponent is still reacting to your last action.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And Rose Lewis is definitely reacting now,&quot; Camille said with satisfaction. &quot;Her public statement yesterday was a disaster. All that talk about &#x27;industry norms&#x27; made her sound completely unrepentant.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;As expected,&quot; Victoria replied. &quot;Rose Lewis has never taken responsibility for anything in her life.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille gazed out at the city. &quot;After Moretti Global, what&#x27;s left? What else does she have to lose?&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria joined her at the window. &quot;Her penthouse. Her investments. The remaining shreds of her social standing. But those are merely material losses. The real victory comes when she finally understands.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Understands what?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That someone deliberately orchestrated her destruction. That it wasn&#x27;t bad luck or media bias. That someone with patience, resources, and intimate knowledge of her weaknesses methodically took everything she valued.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And when will we reveal that someone was us?&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria smiled with genuine pleasure. &quot;When it will hurt the most. When she has nothing left but questions about who destroyed her and why.&quot;<br/><br/>The intercom buzzed. &quot;Ms. Kane, Mr. Moretti is on line one. He&#x27;s asking about unusual trading activity in his company&#x27;s stock.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria and Camille exchanged glances, showing slight surprise.<br/><br/>&quot;Tell him I&#x27;ll speak with him shortly,&quot; Victoria replied.<br/><br/>&quot;He suspects already,&quot; Camille observed. &quot;That complicates things.&quot;</div>
