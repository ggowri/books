        <h1>Chapter 181-2</h1>
        <div><br/>&quot;No,&quot; Camille said softly. &quot;She just said they made a terrible mistake.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;A mistake.&quot; Alexander&#x27;s voice dripped with disdain. &quot;Is that what we&#x27;re calling it?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What would you call it?&quot; Camille asked.<br/><br/>The question hung in the air between them. Alexander stared into his glass as if it held answers.<br/><br/>&quot;Betrayal,&quot; he said finally. &quot;The kind you don&#x27;t come back from.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille moved slowly toward him, closing the distance until she stood just a step away. &quot;I thought the same thing once. About my parents.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander looked up sharply. &quot;That&#x27;s different. Your parents were manipulated by Rose. They didn&#x27;t choose to believe her over you out of preference.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Didn&#x27;t they?&quot; Camille held his gaze. &quot;They wanted to believe her version because it was easier. Because facing what she&#x27;d done, what they&#x27;d allowed, was too painful.&quot;<br/><br/>She reached for his hand, relieved when he didn&#x27;t pull away. &quot;I&#x27;m not saying you should forgive them. I&#x27;m not saying what they did wasn&#x27;t horrible. I&#x27;m just asking you to listen to them. Once. Then decide.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s fingers tightened around hers. &quot;Why are you pushing this? After I&#x27;ve already refused them multiple times?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Because I know what it&#x27;s like to think a door is closed forever,&quot; Camille said quietly. &quot;To believe some wounds can never heal. And to discover I was wrong.&quot;<br/><br/>She thought of her parents, of the slow rebuilding of trust between them. Of the unexpected joy that had come with letting go of old pain.<br/><br/>&quot;If you meet with them and decide nothing has changed, that they haven&#x27;t earned a second chance.... I&#x27;ll support that.&quot; She squeezed his hand. &quot;But don&#x27;t make that decision without hearing them out.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander pulled away, moving back to the window. For a long moment, he stared out at the city, his body rigid with tension.<br/><br/>&quot;She asked if you still have nightmares,&quot; Camille said softly. &quot;Before important events.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s head snapped around, surprise breaking through his anger. &quot;She remembered that?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; Camille watched as something shifted in his expression. &quot;It was the last thing she asked. If you were sleeping well.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander turned back to the window, but not before Camille caught the flash of vulnerability in his eyes.<br/><br/>&quot;I told her you have me now,&quot; she continued. &quot;That you don&#x27;t face things alone anymore.&quot;<br/><br/>The minutes stretched between them, filled only with the distant sounds of the city below. Finally, Alexander&#x27;s shoulders sagged slightly.<br/><br/>&quot;One meeting,&quot; he said, his voice low. &quot;In a public place. And I make no promises about what happens afterward.&quot;<br/><br/>Relief washed through Camille. &quot;That&#x27;s all I&#x27;m asking.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No, it isn&#x27;t.&quot; Alexander turned to face her, his expression softened but serious. &quot;You&#x27;re asking me to reopen wounds that took years to heal. To face people who chose someone else over me when I needed them most. People I&#x27;ve already turned away multiple times.&quot;<br/><br/>He crossed the room to her, taking her hands in his. &quot;But you&#x27;re right about one thing. I don&#x27;t face things alone anymore.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ll be with you,&quot; Camille promised. &quot;Whatever you decide.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander nodded, pressing his forehead against hers. &quot;Set it up, then. Someplace neutral. Someplace I can leave easily if I need to.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Thank you,&quot; Camille whispered.<br/><br/>&quot;Don&#x27;t thank me yet,&quot; Alexander said, pulling back to look at her. &quot;This could go very badly.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Or it could be the start of healing something you thought was broken forever.&quot; Camille touched his face gently. &quot;Either way, you&#x27;ll know you tried.&quot;<br/><br/>Later, as they lay in bed, Alexander spoke into the darkness. &quot;I saw James, you know. Before he died.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille turned to face him, though she could barely make out his features in the dark room. &quot;You never told me that.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;He came to my office. Looked terrible, drinking too much, his life falling apart.&quot; Alexander&#x27;s voice was distant with memory. &quot;Said he had to tell me something important. That he couldn&#x27;t live with the lie anymore.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What did you do?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I told him it was too late. That nothing he could say would change what happened.&quot; Alexander&#x27;s fingers found hers beneath the covers. &quot;Two weeks later, I heard he was dead. Drunk driving, they said.&quot;<br/><br/>The pain in his voice wrapped around Camille&#x27;s heart. &quot;You couldn&#x27;t have known.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No,&quot; he agreed. &quot;But I&#x27;ve wondered since then... if I&#x27;d listened, if I&#x27;d let him confess, would he still be alive? Or did the guilt kill him as surely as the drunk driving?&quot;<br/><br/>Camille had no answer for that. She simply held him closer, feeling the steady beat of his heart against her palm.<br/><br/>&quot;When they came after the funeral, I couldn&#x27;t bear to see them,&quot; Alexander continued quietly. &quot;Couldn&#x27;t bear to watch them grieve for James when they&#x27;d abandoned me. And when my father had his stroke last year...&quot; He trailed off. &quot;I told myself they&#x27;d made their bed. That they didn&#x27;t deserve my sympathy.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And now?&quot; Camille asked gently.<br/><br/>&quot;Now I don&#x27;t know.&quot; His voice was barely audible. &quot;Part of me still wants to refuse. To make them feel a fraction of what I felt. But another part...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Is tired of carrying the weight,&quot; Camille finished for him when he didn&#x27;t continue.<br/><br/>&quot;Yes,&quot; he admitted. &quot;Tired of wondering what they might say. If they truly regret what they did, or if they&#x27;re just lonely now that James is gone.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ll meet them,&quot; Alexander said after a long silence. &quot;But I&#x27;m doing it for me, not for them. I need to know if there&#x27;s anything worth saving. Or if it&#x27;s truly too late.&quot;<br/><br/>As his breathing deepened into sleep, Camille remained awake, thinking of Eleanor Pierce and her sad eyes. Of second chances and roads not taken. Of the healing power of truth, even when it comes years too late.<br/><br/>She had persuaded Alexander to meet his parents. Now she could only hope she hadn&#x27;t made a terrible mistake.<br/></div>
