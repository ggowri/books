        <h1>Chapter 124-2</h1>
        <div><br/>&quot;This isn&#x27;t working,&quot; he said bluntly. &quot;We&#x27;re dancing around everything that matters.&quot;<br/><br/>Margaret looked alarmed. &quot;Richard, please...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No, it&#x27;s time for honesty.&quot; He turned to Camille, his eyes meeting hers directly. &quot;We were wrong. Not just about Rose and Stefan, but about everything. About who you were, what you needed from us, the support we failed to give you.&quot;<br/><br/>He glanced at Victoria, something like grudging respect in his expression. &quot;Ms. Kane has done what we should have done, stood by you, believed in you, helped you become the remarkable woman you now are.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria inclined her head slightly, accepting the acknowledgment without comment.<br/><br/>&quot;When you disappeared,&quot; Richard continued, &quot;when we thought you were dead, the grief nearly destroyed us. Not just grief for your loss, but for all the ways we had failed you while you were with us.&quot;<br/><br/>Margaret reached for her husband&#x27;s hand. &quot;We don&#x27;t expect forgiveness, Camille. We haven&#x27;t earned it. But we want you to know that our door is always open to you. On whatever terms you set.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille felt tears threatening and fought them back. This was what she had wanted for so long, acknowledgment, apology, the possibility of healing. Yet now that it was offered, she found herself uncertain how to respond.<br/><br/>&quot;I don&#x27;t know what to say,&quot; she admitted. &quot;Part of me wants to forgive you instantly and pretend none of it happened. Another part isn&#x27;t ready to trust again.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Then don&#x27;t decide now,&quot; Victoria said, surprising everyone. &quot;Healing doesn&#x27;t happen in a single dinner. It takes time. Consistent effort. Proof.&quot;<br/><br/>Richard nodded slowly. &quot;That&#x27;s fair. More than fair.&quot;<br/><br/>Harrison entered with barely a sound. &quot;Mr. Pierce has arrived, sir.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Send him in,&quot; Richard instructed, though tension showed in his eyes.<br/><br/>Alexander entered the dining room moments later, looking impeccable as always, though surprise flickered across his face at finding Victoria present.<br/><br/>&quot;Alexander,&quot; Victoria greeted him with a small nod. &quot;Perfect timing. We&#x27;ve just finished dinner.&quot;<br/><br/>He recovered quickly, professional mask sliding into place. &quot;I hope I&#x27;m not interrupting.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Not at all,&quot; Margaret assured him. &quot;Would you like some dessert?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Thank you, but we should probably get going,&quot; Alexander replied, sensing the charged atmosphere. &quot;Camille has an early meeting tomorrow.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille stood, grateful for the escape route. &quot;Yes, the final Grid inspection before next week&#x27;s full activation.&quot;<br/><br/>Margaret&#x27;s face fell slightly, but she nodded. &quot;Of course. Your work is important.&quot;<br/><br/>An awkward silence fell as they gathered in the entrance hall. Harrison held Camille&#x27;s coat while a maid retrieved Victoria&#x27;s wrap.<br/><br/>&quot;Thank you for dinner,&quot; Camille said finally. &quot;It was... good to see you both.&quot;<br/><br/>Her father stepped forward, hesitating before asking, &quot;May I hug you?&quot;<br/><br/>The question, so tentative, so unlike the confident father she had known growing up, broke something inside Camille. She nodded, allowing him to embrace her briefly. His arms felt both familiar and strange, the scent of his aftershave triggering memories of childhood.<br/><br/>Margaret moved forward next, her eyes asking the same silent question. Camille permitted another quick embrace, more formal than the one with her father.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;re proud of you,&quot; her mother whispered. &quot;So proud of who you&#x27;ve become.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria watched the exchanges with an unreadable expression before extending her hand to Richard. &quot;Thank you for your hospitality, Mr. Lewis. Mrs. Lewis.&quot;<br/><br/>The formality of the gesture underscored the vast gulf between Camille&#x27;s old life and her new one. Victoria, elegant, powerful, unyielding, stood in stark contrast to the wealthy but flawed parents who had raised her.<br/><br/>As they stepped outside, Alexander&#x27;s hand found the small of her back. &quot;Are you alright?&quot; he asked quietly.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m not sure,&quot; she answered honestly.<br/><br/>Victoria moved ahead of them. &quot;Take her home, Alexander,&quot; she instructed as she reached the car. &quot;She&#x27;s had quite enough family drama for one evening.&quot;<br/><br/>As they settled into the car, Alexander took Camille&#x27;s hand, his fingers intertwining with hers in silent support.<br/><br/>The car pulled away, carrying her from her past toward her future. In the backseat, Camille sat between o two pillars of her new life, Victoria on one side, Alexander on the other. Behind them, the mansion of her childhood grew smaller in the distance, neither fully reconciled nor fully abandoned.<br/><br/>Progress and wounds. Beginnings and endings. The evening had offered both, leaving Camille suspended between what had been and what might yet be.<br/></div>
