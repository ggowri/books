        <h1>Chapter 137-2</h1>
        <div><br/>Camille nodded at the question. &quot;Because destruction was not their only goal. Whoever did this wanted to prove the Phoenix Grid was vulnerable—that our promise of reliable, safe power for New York was empty.&quot; She gestured to the large screen behind her, which flickered to life showing a real-time map of the city&#x27;s power grid. &quot;As you can see, power remains stable across all five boroughs. Hospital systems, emergency services, public transportation—all operating normally.&quot;<br/><br/>Another reporter raised her hand. &quot;But what about the safety concerns raised last week? Could those vulnerabilities have been exploited in these attacks?&quot;<br/><br/>Camille felt a flash of rage at the mention of the fabricated safety concerns Rose and Herod had planted. She pushed it down, keeping her expression professional.<br/><br/>&quot;Those concerns were based on falsified documents, as we demonstrated at our stockholder meeting. In fact, it was our advanced safety systems that prevented these attacks from having their intended effect. The Phoenix Grid was designed with multiple layers of protection precisely because we understood the critical nature of the infrastructure we were building.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What about the cost of repairs?&quot; shouted a man from the back. &quot;Will Kane Industries stock take a hit?&quot;<br/><br/>Camille allowed herself a small smile. &quot;The Phoenix Grid was named for a reason. The mythical phoenix burns and is reborn stronger. By this afternoon, our repair teams will have restored the damaged sections to eighty percent capacity. By this time tomorrow, we expect full restoration.&quot;<br/><br/>She leaned forward slightly, her voice dropping so the reporters had to lean in to hear her. &quot;Whoever attacked us clearly doesn&#x27;t understand what we built. The Phoenix Grid isn&#x27;t just infrastructure, it&#x27;s a new way of thinking about power. Distributed, resilient, self-healing. You can knock down parts, but the whole remains strong.&quot;<br/><br/>The questions continued for twenty minutes. With each answer, Camille felt the mood in the room shifting. The initial skepticism gave way to something else, a grudging respect, even admiration. She answered everything directly, never dodging difficult questions, never making promises she couldn&#x27;t keep.<br/><br/>When she sensed the moment was right, she played her final card.<br/><br/>&quot;Before I take my last question, I want to share something with you.&quot; She nodded to Hannah, who tapped her tablet.<br/><br/>The large screen behind Camille changed to show the Kane Industries building. &quot;As of four a.m. this morning, this building, our headquarters is running entirely on Phoenix Grid power. Not backup generators. Not the city grid. Our grid.&quot;<br/><br/>A murmur ran through the assembled reporters.<br/><br/>&quot;The lights you&#x27;re sitting under, the microphones you&#x27;re speaking into, the cameras recording this, all powered by the same system that was attacked last night.&quot; Camille spread her hands. &quot;We&#x27;re not just talking about our confidence in this technology. We&#x27;re demonstrating it. Because that&#x27;s what Kane Industries does. We don&#x27;t just tell you that something works, we show you.&quot;<br/><br/>The press conference ended with a barrage of camera flashes. As Camille walked from the podium, she caught sight of Victoria standing in the back of the room, a rare smile on her normally stern face.<br/><br/>Back in the crisis room, the mood had transformed. The engineering team was cheering as they watched the first positive headlines appear on the screens.<br/><br/>&quot;PHOENIX RISES: KANE GRID WITHSTANDS TERRORIST ATTACK&quot;<br/>&quot;KANE INDUSTRIES DEMONSTRATES GRID RESILIENCE AFTER BOMBING&quot;<br/>&quot;CAMILLE KANE TURNS CRISIS INTO TRIUMPH&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander wrapped his arm around Camille&#x27;s waist. &quot;Masterful,&quot; he whispered in her ear.<br/><br/>Victoria approached, her expression solemn despite the celebration around them. &quot;Well done,&quot; she said simply, but Camille could see the pride in her eyes. &quot;The market&#x27;s responding. Stock&#x27;s now down only three percent.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;ll recover,&quot; Camille said.<br/><br/>&quot;Yes,&quot; Victoria agreed. &quot;But this isn&#x27;t over.&quot; She lowered her voice so only Camille and Alexander could hear. &quot;Rose and Herod are desperate now. They failed twice. They won&#x27;t stop.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I know,&quot; Camille said, her hand going to the phoenix pendant at her throat. &quot;But neither will we.&quot;<br/><br/>Hannah rushed over, her face flushed with excitement. &quot;The repairs at Substation 12 are ahead of schedule,&quot; she said, holding up her tablet. &quot;And look at these numbers.&quot;<br/><br/>The screen showed power distribution figures across the city. Despite the damage, the system had maintained stability.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;re getting calls from three major tech companies,&quot; Hannah continued. &quot;They want to license the safety protocols we designed. The attack actually proved how effective our systems are.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria nodded, a hint of satisfaction breaking through her exhaustion. &quot;Crisis becomes opportunity.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;re not out of danger yet,&quot; Alexander cautioned, his voice low. &quot;The security team found this.&quot;<br/><br/>He handed Camille a tablet showing surveillance footage from the damaged substation. In the corner of the frame, barely visible in the smoke and confusion after the explosion, was a familiar figure watching from a distance.<br/><br/>&quot;Rose,&quot; Camille whispered, her fingers unconsciously touching the phoenix pendant at her throat.<br/><br/>Victoria leaned closer to study the image. &quot;She was there. Watching her handiwork.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;She won&#x27;t stop,&quot; Camille said, her voice hardening. &quot;Two substations down, but the Grid remains functional. She&#x27;ll try again.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander nodded grimly. &quot;Security at all remaining substations has been tripled, and I&#x27;ve brought in my own team to protect the main control center.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s not just the Grid she wants to destroy,&quot; Camille said quietly. &quot;It&#x27;s me. Everything I&#x27;ve built. Everything I am.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria placed a hand on Camille&#x27;s shoulder, a rare gesture of physical support. &quot;Then we make sure she fails. Again and again, until she has nothing left.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille looked at the monitors showing the positive headlines, the rising stock price, the intact power grid. Rose had tried to destroy everything she&#x27;d built, but instead, she&#x27;d only proven its strength. Just as she&#x27;d once tried to destroy Camille herself, only to create something stronger in her place.<br/><br/>&quot;Let her come,&quot; Camille said, her voice steady and cold. &quot;This time, I&#x27;m ready for her.&quot;<br/></div>
