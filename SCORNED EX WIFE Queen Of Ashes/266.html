        <h1>Chapter 170-2</h1>
        <div><br/>&quot;I do.&quot; Stefan took a careful step forward. &quot;I spent years pretending to be someone I wasn&#x27;t. The perfect husband. The perfect businessman. I know what it&#x27;s like to live a lie.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s gun hand wavered slightly.<br/><br/>Behind her, a security guard Rose thought was unconscious stirred, reaching for his fallen weapon.<br/><br/>Everything happened at once.<br/><br/>The guard fired wildly.<br/><br/>Alexander lunged forward.<br/><br/>Rose spun toward the new threat.<br/><br/>And Stefan threw himself at Camille, pushing her down as bullets tore through the air where she had stood.<br/><br/>Pain exploded in Stefan&#x27;s shoulder. Hot, searing pain that stole his breath and sent him crashing to his knees. He heard shouting, gunfire, the splash of water. His vision blurred.<br/><br/>Through the haze of pain, he saw Alexander grappling with Rose. They struggled at the edge of the dock, Rose scratching and biting like a cornered animal. The gun flew from her hand, skittering across the wet wood and into the water.<br/><br/>&quot;You ruined everything!&quot; Rose screamed, slamming her fist into Alexander&#x27;s jaw.<br/><br/>Alexander barely flinched. He locked his arms around Rose, pinning her own to her sides. &quot;It&#x27;s over,&quot; he said, his voice cold as stone.<br/><br/>Rose went limp so suddenly that Alexander nearly lost his grip. Then, with a cry of pure rage, she twisted violently, breaking free. She stumbled backward, too far.<br/><br/>For one suspended moment, Rose teetered at the edge of the dock, her eyes wide with surprise. Then she fell, hitting the water with a splash that was swallowed by the storm.<br/><br/>Alexander moved to dive after her, but his security team was faster. Two men jumped into the churning lake as Rose surfaced, gasping and fighting.<br/><br/>Stefan felt hands on his face, gentle but urgent. Camille knelt before him, her bound wrists extended awkwardly.<br/><br/>&quot;Stefan? Look at me,&quot; she commanded. Her voice seemed to come from far away. &quot;Stay with me.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan tried to focus on her face, but darkness crept in at the edges of his vision. &quot;You&#x27;re safe,&quot; he mumbled. &quot;That&#x27;s what matters.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Don&#x27;t you dare,&quot; Camille said fiercely. &quot;Don&#x27;t you dare check out now.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander appeared behind her, cutting through her restraints with a pocket knife. The moment her hands were free, Camille pressed them against Stefan&#x27;s wound.<br/><br/>The pain flared, shocking him back to full awareness. He groaned.<br/><br/>&quot;Good,&quot; Camille said. &quot;Feel that. Stay angry. Stay here.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander knelt beside them, shrugging off his jacket and pressing it against the wound. &quot;Medic&#x27;s on the way,&quot; he told Camille. &quot;Two minutes out.&quot;<br/><br/>Behind them, Rose&#x27;s shouts filled the boathouse as the security team dragged her from the water and restrained her. She thrashed and screamed, wild-eyed with fury and defeat.<br/><br/>&quot;Look at me,&quot; Camille said to Stefan, ignoring Rose&#x27;s cries. &quot;Just at me.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan fixed his gaze on her face. Despite everything, the bruises, the exhaustion, the ordeal of her captivity, she looked stronger than he&#x27;d ever seen her. Not the woman he&#x27;d married and betrayed, but someone forged in fire, tempered by pain.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m sorry,&quot; he whispered. &quot;For everything.&quot;<br/><br/>A sad smile touched her lips. &quot;I know.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I didn&#x27;t deserve you.&quot; Blood stained his lips now, making it harder to speak. &quot;I never did.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Hush,&quot; Camille said, pressing harder on his wound. Pain sparked through him again, keeping him conscious. &quot;Save your strength.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s voice rose in pitch, her words becoming incoherent. The sound of a helicopter approached, its rotors beating against the storm.<br/><br/>&quot;Stay with him,&quot; Alexander told Camille, standing. &quot;I&#x27;ll handle her.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan watched through dimming vision as Alexander strode toward Rose. The two security men holding her stepped back, still keeping a firm grip on her arms.<br/><br/>Alexander leaned in close, saying something to Rose that Stefan couldn&#x27;t hear. Whatever it was made Rose go still, the fight draining from her body. Her shoulders slumped. Her head bowed.<br/><br/>&quot;Stefan, focus,&quot; Camille said, drawing his attention back. &quot;The medics are almost here. Just hold on.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan reached up with his good arm, his fingers brushing her cheek. &quot;You found your strength,&quot; he murmured. &quot;The strength I was too blind to see.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille caught his hand, pressing it against her face. &quot;Yes,&quot; she said simply. &quot;I did.&quot;<br/><br/>The boathouse filled with new activity as medical personnel rushed in. Someone gently moved Camille aside, replacing her hands with professional pressure on Stefan&#x27;s wound.<br/><br/>Through the crowd of people now surrounding him, Stefan caught a last glimpse of Rose being led away, her head still bowed, the fight gone out of her. The sister who had tried to destroy Camille, now destroyed herself.<br/><br/>As darkness finally claimed him, Stefan&#x27;s last thought was of the wooden fishing lure in his pocket, the symbol of a childhood Camille had once cherished. A childhood before Rose. Before him. Before all the pain they&#x27;d caused her.<br/><br/>He hoped she would find that innocence again someday.<br/><br/>And he hoped, whatever came next for him, that he had begun to make amends.<br/></div>
