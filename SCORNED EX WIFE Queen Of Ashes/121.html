        <h1>Chapter 85-2</h1>
        <div><br/>&quot;You won&#x27;t need to.&quot; Herod rose and crossed to a sleek desk, returning with a laptop. &quot;Victoria and Camille are launching something called the Phoenix Grid. Clean energy infrastructure worth billions.&quot; He opened the computer, turning it to show Rose a series of documents. &quot;I have people inside Kane Industries feeding me information. The project breaks ground next month.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose studied the screen, unimpressed. &quot;So?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;So the technology doesn&#x27;t work.&quot; Herod&#x27;s voice dropped to a whisper. &quot;Not the way they think it does. My sources tell me there are fatal flaws in the design that their testing hasn&#x27;t revealed. When deployed at scale, the system will fail catastrophically.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And this helps us how?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Rose,&quot; Herod said with exaggerated patience, &quot;Kane Industries is investing forty percent of their liquid assets in this project. Alexander Pierce is committing similar amounts. When it fails, stock prices will collapse. But more importantly, if we acquire certain information before the failure and position ourselves correctly...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We can profit from their downfall,&quot; Rose finished, understanding dawning.<br/><br/>&quot;Precisely. And with the right evidence leaked to the right people, we can make it appear that Camille knew about the flaws all along. That she deliberately misled investors.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Securities fraud,&quot; Rose murmured. &quot;Prison time.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And complete destruction of the Kane legacy.&quot; Herod closed the laptop. &quot;Victoria would lose everything, her company, her reputation, and her precious new daughter.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose felt a smile spread across her face for the first time in weeks. &quot;I want to be there when it happens. I want to see her face when she realizes she&#x27;s lost everything, just like I did.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s the spirit.&quot; Herod reached for a decanter. &quot;More bourbon?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Not yet.&quot; Rose stood and walked to the windows, gazing out at the city that had once been her playground. &quot;Tell me more about this Phoenix Grid. Who designed it?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Their chief engineer is someone named Hannah Zhao. Brilliant but inexperienced. The fatal flaws are in her integration systems.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose turned, a strange light in her eyes. &quot;And who oversees the project for Kane Industries?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Camille herself. It&#x27;s her pet project, her big debut as Victoria&#x27;s heir.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And Alexander Pierce? What&#x27;s his involvement?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;He&#x27;s all in. Provided the original solar technology. His reputation in sustainable energy rides on this project&#x27;s success.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose pressed her palms against the cool glass, feeling the vibration of the city below. &quot;I know where to strike.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Oh?&quot; Herod raised an eyebrow.<br/><br/>&quot;Camille thinks she&#x27;s won. That I&#x27;m beaten.&quot; Rose&#x27;s reflection smiled back at her, feral and hungry. &quot;But I know something Victoria Kane doesn&#x27;t.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And what&#x27;s that?&quot;<br/><br/>Rose turned from the window, her face transformed by purpose. &quot;I know Camille&#x27;s greatest weakness isn&#x27;t Victoria or even Alexander Pierce. It&#x27;s that she still thinks like Camille Lewis underneath it all. Still believes in things like justice and redemption.&quot; Her laugh was brittle. &quot;And I know exactly how to use that against her.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod watched her with new interest. &quot;I think this arrangement will benefit us both tremendously.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s not about benefit.&quot; Rose&#x27;s voice hardened. &quot;It&#x27;s about survival. Camille took everything from me, my reputation, my business, Stefan. She turned my parents against me and made me a social pariah.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And now?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Now I&#x27;ll take everything from her.&quot; Rose picked up her abandoned bourbon and drained it. &quot;Not just her money or company. I&#x27;ll take her soul.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod refilled her glass. &quot;To detailed planning and perfect execution.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose raised her glass, but her mind was already racing ahead, calculating angles and vulnerabilities. For the first time since the Phoenix Gala, she felt alive again. Not just with anger, but with purpose.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ll need access to your sources inside Kane Industries,&quot; she said. &quot;And I&#x27;ll need to know everything about this Hannah Zhao.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Consider it done.&quot; Herod pressed a button on a remote, and a hidden door slid open. &quot;I&#x27;ve prepared a suite for you. Everything you need should be there, including new identification and credit cards.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose nodded, taking the hallway toward her new quarters. Behind her, she heard Herod call out.<br/><br/>&quot;What exactly did you mean, Rose? About knowing where to strike?&quot;<br/><br/>She paused in the doorway, not bothering to turn around. &quot;Camille thinks she died in that parking garage and was reborn stronger. But she&#x27;s wrong. She&#x27;s still the same underneath, still believes in fixing things rather than destroying them.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And?&quot;<br/><br/>Rose glanced over her shoulder, her eyes gleaming in the half-light. &quot;The Phoenix Grid isn&#x27;t just a project to her. It&#x27;s her redemption. Her proof that she can create instead of destroy.&quot; Her lips curved into a smile. &quot;And when we take that from her, when we turn her creation into destruction, we won&#x27;t just ruin her financially.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;ll break her completely,&quot; Herod finished, understanding darkening his features.<br/><br/>&quot;Exactly.&quot; Rose stepped through the doorway. &quot;We strike at the heart of who she&#x27;s trying to become. And I know exactly how to do it.&quot;<br/><br/>The door slid closed behind her, leaving Herod staring after her with newfound respect, and perhaps a touch of fear, for the woman who&#x27;d lost everything but her capacity for calculated cruelty.<br/></div>
