        <h1>Chapter 121-2</h1>
        <div><br/>Something shifted in Herod&#x27;s expression as he watched her, a dark appreciation for the fury burning through her. He set down his empty glass and stepped closer.<br/><br/>&quot;Then we&#x27;ll find another way,&quot; he said, his voice lower now. &quot;A more direct approach.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I mean,&quot; Herod said carefully, &quot;that perhaps we&#x27;ve been too subtle. Too focused on financial maneuvers and public opinion. Perhaps it&#x27;s time for something more... definitive.&quot;<br/><br/>The implication hung in the air between them. Rose felt her heart beat faster, not with fear but with a terrible excitement. &quot;You mean...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I mean Victoria Kane is scheduled to return to work next week,&quot; Herod interrupted. &quot;The Phoenix Grid&#x27;s final section goes live the day after. Both events will require their physical presence at specific locations, at specific times.&quot;<br/><br/>His eyes held hers, dark and unblinking. &quot;Predictability creates vulnerability.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose felt her breath catch. This was new territory, beyond anything they had discussed before. Not reputation destruction or financial ruin, but something far more permanent. The thought should have frightened her, but instead, she felt a surge of dark exhilaration.<br/><br/>&quot;Would you really go that far?&quot; she asked quietly.<br/><br/>Herod&#x27;s hand came up, fingers tracing the line of her jaw with unexpected gentleness. &quot;The Prestons have a long memory for those who destroy what&#x27;s ours. Victoria took everything from my family. I&#x27;ve waited years for my chance at justice.&quot;<br/><br/>His touch sent an electric current through Rose&#x27;s skin. In that moment, she recognized in him the same consuming fire that burned in her, the need for vengeance so powerful it had shaped every decision, every action, every moment of their lives for years.<br/><br/>&quot;And you?&quot; he asked, his fingers still against her skin. &quot;How far would you go to destroy your sister?&quot;<br/><br/>Rose didn&#x27;t hesitate. &quot;All the way.&quot;<br/><br/>Something sparked between them then, a recognition, an understanding deeper than words. Herod&#x27;s hand slid to the back of her neck, pulling her toward him. Their lips met in a kiss that contained nothing of tenderness, only shared hunger, shared rage, shared purpose.<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s anger didn&#x27;t diminish with his touch, it transformed, channeling into a different kind of heat that raced through her veins. She pressed against him, fingers digging into his shoulders hard enough to bruise. Their bodies collided like storm fronts, violent and inevitable.<br/><br/>Clothes fell away, scattered across the penthouse floor as they moved toward the bedroom. Rose welcomed the pain of his grip, the harsh press of his mouth against hers. This wasn&#x27;t about pleasure or affection, it was about power, about connection forged in shared hatred, about finding in each other the perfect vessel for their darkest impulses.<br/><br/>Later, tangled in sheets damp with sweat, Rose stared at the ceiling, her body still humming with nervous energy despite physical exhaustion. Beside her, Herod traced the line of her spine with idle fingers.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;ll need to be careful,&quot; he said, breaking the long silence. &quot;What we&#x27;re considering... there&#x27;s no coming back from it.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose turned to face him, her eyes glittering in the dim light. &quot;I crossed the point of no return long ago. The moment I hired those men to attack Camille in that parking garage.&quot;<br/><br/>A shadow crossed Herod&#x27;s face. &quot;You never told me the details of that night.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I never meant for her to die,&quot; Rose admitted, the words sounding hollow even to her own ears. &quot;I just wanted her scared enough to leave town, to disappear from my life. Things... escalated.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And now?&quot;<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s lips curved in a smile that held no warmth. &quot;Now I understand my mistake. Half measures. I left too much to chance.&quot;<br/><br/>She sat up, the sheet falling away, her naked body silver in the moonlight streaming through the windows. &quot;This time, I won&#x27;t make the same error. This time, there will be no room for failure.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod watched her, his expression unreadable. &quot;Victoria first?&quot;<br/><br/>Rose nodded. &quot;Cut off the head, and the body will follow. Without Victoria, Camille is just a woman playing dress-up in someone else&#x27;s life. She&#x27;ll crumble.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And Alexander?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Will be too busy grieving to see us coming,&quot; Rose replied coldly. She leaned down, her hair creating a curtain around their faces as she kissed him again, harder this time, claiming, marking. &quot;Together, we&#x27;ll take everything they&#x27;ve built. Together, we&#x27;ll watch it burn.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod pulled her back down beside him, his hands tangling in her hair. &quot;Tomorrow we plan. Tonight...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Tonight we celebrate the beginning of the end,&quot; Rose finished for him, her body moving against his with renewed purpose. The anger that had consumed her earlier hadn&#x27;t disappeared, it had transformed into something more focused, more deadly, a cold determined fire that would not be extinguished until she had everything she wanted.<br/><br/>As dawn broke over the city, Rose stood naked at the penthouse windows, watching the first light touch the buildings where her enemies slept, unaware of what was coming for them. Behind her, Herod&#x27;s reflection appeared as he approached, wrapping his arms around her waist.<br/><br/>&quot;What are you thinking?&quot; he asked, his breath warm against her neck.<br/><br/>Rose placed her palm against the cool glass, as if reaching for the city beyond. &quot;I&#x27;m thinking about the day Camille found those divorce papers. How surprised she looked, how hurt. How satisfying it was to finally drop the mask after all those years of pretending to care about her.&quot;<br/><br/>She turned in his arms, her eyes hard with certainty. &quot;I want to see that look on her face again. The moment she realizes she&#x27;s lost everything. The moment before the end.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod&#x27;s hands tightened on her waist. &quot;And you will. I promise you that.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose smiled as she kissed him again, the taste of victory already sweet on her tongue. This time, there would be no clever press conferences, no strategic announcements, no spinning failure into success.<br/><br/>This time, there would be only ashes.<br/></div>
