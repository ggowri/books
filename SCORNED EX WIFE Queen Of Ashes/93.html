        <div><br/>Victoria shook her head. &quot;It accelerates things. Suspicion creates anxiety. Anxiety leads to poor decisions.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You want him to panic,&quot; Camille realized admiringly.<br/><br/>&quot;Fear makes the simplest solution more attractive,&quot; Victoria confirmed. &quot;In this case, accepting our offer before he fully understands our intentions.&quot;<br/><br/>They moved to Victoria&#x27;s office for the call. As Victoria settled behind her desk, Camille took the chair beside her.<br/><br/>&quot;Remember,&quot; Victoria said, &quot;this is business. Not personal. At least as far as Fabio Moretti knows.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille composed her features as Victoria initiated the video call. Fabio Moretti appeared, a distinguished Italian man in his sixties with worried eyes.<br/><br/>&quot;Victoria,&quot; he began without preamble, &quot;what are you doing with my company&#x27;s stock?&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria remained pleasantly neutral. &quot;Good afternoon, Fabio. I see news travels quickly.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Don&#x27;t play games,&quot; he replied, accent thickening with emotion. &quot;Three banks have called about unusual trading patterns. Are you behind this?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Kane Industries is always exploring acquisition opportunities in complementary sectors,&quot; Victoria replied smoothly. &quot;Your company&#x27;s recent expansion aligns with our interests.&quot;<br/><br/>Moretti&#x27;s eyes narrowed. &quot;This isn&#x27;t about strategic interests. This is about Rose Lewis.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria raised an eyebrow. &quot;I&#x27;m not sure I understand the connection.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You understand perfectly,&quot; Moretti countered angrily. &quot;First Rodriguez Shipping. Then the Lewis brand. Now my company. You&#x27;re systematically destroying everyone connected to Rose.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille leaned forward. &quot;Mr. Moretti, business isn&#x27;t personal. Our interest in your company is based on infrastructure and client relationships, not personal connections.&quot;<br/><br/>Moretti studied her with sudden intensity. &quot;You&#x27;re Victoria&#x27;s daughter. The one who appeared so suddenly last year.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Camille Kane,&quot; she confirmed. &quot;I&#x27;ve been overseeing our expansion into luxury retail distribution.&quot;<br/><br/>Something flickered in Moretti&#x27;s eyes, a flash of recognition quickly masked. &quot;And now you want my company.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We want to discuss a mutually beneficial arrangement,&quot; Victoria interjected. &quot;Your company faces significant challenges after the Lewis brand collapse. We&#x27;re prepared to offer stability and growth opportunities.&quot;<br/><br/>Moretti&#x27;s face hardened. &quot;My family&#x27;s interests include supporting my goddaughter during the worst crisis of her life.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Again, you misunderstand our intentions,&quot; Victoria replied cooling. &quot;But since you&#x27;ve raised the subject, what do you plan to do with Rose Lewis&#x27;s fifteen percent stake now that her business has collapsed and embezzlement charges are forthcoming?&quot;<br/><br/>Visible shock crossed Moretti&#x27;s face. &quot;Embezzlement? What embezzlement?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It hasn&#x27;t hit the news yet,&quot; Camille said, almost sympathetically. &quot;But financial irregularities at Lewis Designs have been discovered. Significant funds diverted to personal use. The board will announce tomorrow.&quot;<br/><br/>Moretti seemed to age before their eyes. &quot;I don&#x27;t believe it. Not Rose.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The evidence is quite clear,&quot; Victoria said with false compassion. &quot;I understand this puts you in a difficult position. Your goddaughter&#x27;s reputation in tatters. Her stake now a liability. And Kane Industries making inquiries about acquisition.&quot;<br/><br/>She paused. &quot;Perhaps we should discuss how to move forward in a way that protects what matters most to you.&quot;<br/><br/>Moretti&#x27;s expression showed the beginning of resignation.<br/><br/>&quot;What are you offering?&quot; he asked finally.<br/><br/>&quot;A premium on current share values. Continued operational autonomy. And a special consulting contract that would allow you to step back while maintaining influence and income.&quot; Victoria outlined efficiently. &quot;Plus a guaranteed position for your daughter&#x27;s new fashion line in our retail distribution network.&quot;<br/><br/>The mention of his daughter&#x27;s business caught Moretti&#x27;s attention, exactly as intended.<br/><br/>&quot;And Rose&#x27;s shares?&quot; he asked, voice heavy with conflicted loyalty.<br/><br/>&quot;We would purchase those at the same premium as all other shares,&quot; Victoria replied, not mentioning how that payment would be structured to trigger immediate tax liabilities for Rose while limiting her access to the funds.<br/><br/>&quot;I need time to consider,&quot; Moretti said, though his tone suggested defeat.<br/><br/>&quot;Of course,&quot; Victoria agreed. &quot;However, our offer is time-sensitive. The formal details will be delivered within the hour, with a forty-eight-hour acceptance window.&quot;<br/><br/>Moretti nodded distractedly. &quot;I&#x27;ll review it with my board.&quot;<br/><br/>After ending the call, Victoria turned to Camille with satisfaction. &quot;He&#x27;ll accept within twenty-four hours. The daughter&#x27;s fashion line was the key. He won&#x27;t risk her future even for Rose.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded, impressed by Victoria&#x27;s ability to exploit emotional vulnerabilities. &quot;He suspected a connection between our actions and Rose&#x27;s troubles.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Of course he did,&quot; Victoria replied. &quot;He&#x27;s known Rose since childhood. What he doesn&#x27;t know is that her downfall isn&#x27;t random justice but calculated destruction.&quot;<br/><br/>She sent a quick message to the acquisition team. &quot;Proceed with the formal offer immediately. Emphasize the benefits to Moretti&#x27;s daughter.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille watched afternoon light glitter against Manhattan&#x27;s towers. &quot;Rose will contact him the moment she hears about our offer.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Undoubtedly,&quot; Victoria agreed. &quot;But by then, it will be too late.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And Rose loses another person who might have helped her rebuild,&quot; Camille said with satisfaction tinged with complexity. &quot;Another pillar knocked away.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria studied her protégée. &quot;Does that trouble you? The systematic isolation?&quot;<br/><br/>Camille met her mentor&#x27;s gaze directly. &quot;No. It feels like justice.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria nodded, pleased. &quot;Precisely. This isn&#x27;t merely revenge. This is the universe rebalancing. Every person who enabled Rose Lewis&#x27;s deceptions, who helped her build success on lies, they all face consequences now.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Including Fabio Moretti,&quot; Camille concluded.<br/><br/>&quot;Especially Fabio Moretti,&quot; Victoria confirmed. &quot;He knew exactly who Rose Lewis was, yet gave her legitimacy. Made her theft and deception possible through his support.&quot;<br/><br/>She glanced at her watch. &quot;By this time tomorrow, we&#x27;ll own controlling interest in Moretti Global Logistics. And Rose Lewis will have lost her godfather&#x27;s support, both emotional and financial.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille moved toward the door. &quot;Should I prepare a statement for when the acquisition is announced?&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria smiled slightly. &quot;Yes. Something about strategic synergies and expanded opportunities. Nothing that mentions Rose Lewis.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And when she realizes what we&#x27;ve done?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;She&#x27;ll rage. She&#x27;ll threaten. She may even try to fight back,&quot; Victoria&#x27;s smile widened. &quot;But with what resources? With what allies? With what reputation or credibility?&quot;<br/><br/>The answer hung unspoken between them. Rose Lewis had nothing left. No company. No supporters. No credibility. Nothing but the growing realization that her destruction had been meticulously planned by someone with intimate knowledge of her vulnerabilities.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ll draft the statement,&quot; Camille said, &quot;and prepare for tomorrow&#x27;s announcements about the embezzlement evidence.&quot;<br/><br/>As the door closed behind her, Victoria turned back to the Manhattan skyline, satisfaction evident in her posture. Another piece in place. Another connection severed. Another blow landed against the woman who had never faced consequences for her actions.<br/><br/>Until now.<br/></div>
