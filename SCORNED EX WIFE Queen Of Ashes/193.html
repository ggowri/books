        <h1>Chapter 127-2</h1>
        <div><br/>She moved closer, invading his space. &quot;You promised me her destruction. You promised me she would lose everything, just as I did.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And she will,&quot; Herod assured her. &quot;But we do it my way. Calculated. Precise. Not with some half-formed plan born of jealousy over an engagement ring.&quot;<br/><br/>Wrong move. Rose&#x27;s hand struck his face with surprising force, the crack of the slap echoing in the sleek kitchen.<br/><br/>&quot;Jealousy?&quot; she hissed. &quot;Is that what you think this is?&quot;<br/><br/>Herod touched his cheek, feeling the sting. For the first time since their partnership began, he felt a whisper of fear. Not of Rose&#x27;s physical capabilities, he outmatched her there, but of her unpredictability, her willingness to burn everything down including herself.<br/><br/>&quot;I think,&quot; he said carefully, &quot;that this news has affected you strongly, and we should take time to incorporate it into our plans properly.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose stepped back, her breathing ragged. For a moment, she seemed to regain some control, smoothing her hair with shaking hands.<br/><br/>&quot;Fine,&quot; she said after a beat. &quot;We&#x27;ll plan. But I want her to hurt, Herod. Not just her company, not just her reputation. I want her to feel what I felt when she took everything from me.&quot;<br/><br/>She moved to the windows, staring out at the twinkling city lights. &quot;I want her to know, in her final moments, that her perfect life, her engagement, her future, all of it was just an illusion.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod watched her silhouette against the glass, recognizing the dangerous precipice they were approaching. The woman he had partnered with for revenge was transforming before his eyes into something more volatile, more lethal.<br/><br/>&quot;I can make that happen,&quot; he promised, though doubt crept into his mind for the first time. &quot;But we stick to the plan. The Grid launch, the vulnerability in the western junction.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose didn&#x27;t respond, continuing to stare out at the city. Herod moved to his office, needing distance, needing to think. He closed the door behind him, leaning against it as a wave of uncertainty washed over him.<br/><br/>This had begun as a business venture, albeit one motivated by vengeance. Take down Victoria Kane, acquire her company, dismantle her achievements, all while making a profit. Clean, strategic, controlled.<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s vendetta against her sister had seemed complementary to his goals. Her inside knowledge of Camille, her ruthless determination, her willingness to do whatever necessary, all assets to his plan.<br/><br/>Now he wondered if he had miscalculated. If Rose&#x27;s hatred for Camille might actually be a liability rather than an advantage. If her deteriorating stability might bring them both down.<br/><br/>He moved to his desk, unlocking the bottom drawer where he kept contingency plans for every business venture. Inside was a slim folder containing documents he had prepared but hoped never to use, dissolution papers for his partnership with Rose, protection measures in case she ever turned against him.<br/><br/>His finger traced the folder&#x27;s edge, contemplating. Cutting Rose loose now would be the prudent business decision. She was becoming erratic, emotional, dangerous. Yet the thought of telling her, of watching those wild eyes turn on him with the same hatred she directed at Camille, it made his pulse quicken with uncharacteristic fear.<br/><br/>A crash from the kitchen interrupted his thoughts. Something else thrown, something else broken in Rose&#x27;s rage. He closed the drawer without removing the folder. Not yet. Not until after the Grid launch. He needed her for that final move, needed her knowledge of Camille&#x27;s patterns and weaknesses.<br/><br/>After that... after that, they would see.<br/><br/>Herod returned to the main room to find Rose still staring out the window, a fresh tumbler of bourbon in her hand. The floor around her feet glittered with fragments of whatever she had broken in his absence.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ve been thinking,&quot; he said, maintaining a safe distance. &quot;Perhaps we should attend the Grid launch ourselves.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose turned, something predatory in her movement. &quot;Why would they allow us anywhere near it?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;They wouldn&#x27;t,&quot; Herod agreed. &quot;But security will be focused on protecting the dignitaries, the press, the VIPs. With the right disguises, we could be there, watching our plan unfold up close.&quot;<br/><br/>A slow, terrible smile spread across Rose&#x27;s face. &quot;Yes,&quot; she breathed. &quot;I want to see her face. When it all falls apart, I want to be there.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Then we&#x27;ll make it happen,&quot; Herod promised, not mentioning that his real reason was to keep Rose under his direct supervision, to prevent whatever impulsive action she might take if left alone with her spiraling thoughts.<br/><br/>She moved toward him, the smile still playing on her lips. &quot;I knew you&#x27;d understand,&quot; she murmured, reaching for him. &quot;You&#x27;re the only one who ever has.&quot;<br/><br/>Her kiss tasted of bourbon and desperation. Herod returned it automatically, his mind calculating even as his body responded. This volatile version of Rose was unpredictable, dangerous, but perhaps manageable, if he kept her focused on their shared goal.<br/><br/>Later, as Rose slept beside him, Herod lay awake staring at the ceiling. Her naked body was curled possessively around his, one arm flung across his chest like a claim. In sleep, her face had softened, the manic energy temporarily subdued.<br/><br/>He carefully extricated himself from her grip, moving silently to the window. The city sprawled below, millions of lives interconnected yet separate.<br/><br/>He glanced back at the sleeping woman, seeing not the polished socialite who he had first approached with her scheme for revenge, but something altogether more dangerous, a woman with nothing left to lose, who viewed her sister&#x27;s happiness as a personal affront, a final insult that demanded blood.<br/><br/>Herod had wanted Victoria Kane&#x27;s empire, her power, her legacy. He had never signed up for the madness that now slept in his bed, the unpredictable fury that might consume them all.<br/><br/>A week until the Grid launch. A week to either contain Rose&#x27;s volatile rage or to extricate himself from her entirely.<br/><br/>A week that suddenly seemed far too short, and the path ahead far too uncertain.<br/></div>
