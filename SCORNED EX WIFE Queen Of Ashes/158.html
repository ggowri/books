        <h1>Chapter 106-2</h1>
        <div><br/>&quot;Victoria wants to wait. Use Greene to lead us to him.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;While we wait, they&#x27;re planning something we haven&#x27;t anticipated.&quot; Camille paced the kitchen, her nightmare&#x27;s urgency transferring to her waking thoughts. &quot;The Grid sabotage. The stock purchases. Greene&#x27;s betrayal. It&#x27;s all connected, but we&#x27;re missing the pattern.&quot;<br/><br/>She stopped abruptly at the window, staring out into the darkness. The garden lights cast long shadows across the lawn, creating shapes that seemed to shift and move with a life of their own.<br/><br/>&quot;What if there&#x27;s another layer we haven&#x27;t uncovered yet?&quot; she asked softly. &quot;What if everything we&#x27;ve discovered so far is just the surface?&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander joined her at the window. &quot;What are you thinking?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m thinking about Rose,&quot; Camille said. &quot;She&#x27;s always been careful. Methodical. Her manipulation of my family took years of patient planning. And Herod...&quot; She shook her head. &quot;Victoria says he&#x27;s been building his revenge for a decade. People like that don&#x27;t put all their hopes on one plan.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Victoria&#x27;s releasing false information tomorrow,&quot; Alexander said. &quot;A press release about a major partnership between Kane Industries and Pierce Enterprises. Designed to make Herod react.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And expose himself,&quot; Camille nodded. &quot;Smart. But I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s enough.&quot;<br/><br/>She moved to the refrigerator, pulling out milk to reheat their cooling hot chocolate. As she stirred the milk in a pan, her mind raced through possibilities.<br/><br/>&quot;The stock purchases,&quot; she said suddenly. &quot;When did they begin?&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander leaned against the counter beside her. &quot;Six months ago, according to Victoria&#x27;s investigators.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Before Rose connected with Herod,&quot; Camille noted. &quot;Before the Grid sabotage plans.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes. Which suggests....&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That Rose didn&#x27;t find Herod,&quot; Camille finished. &quot;Herod found Rose. He sought her out specifically because of her connection to me.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s eyes narrowed as he followed her logic. &quot;So Rose isn&#x27;t the mastermind here. She&#x27;s a tool.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;A weapon aimed at me.&quot; Camille poured the warmed milk into their mugs. &quot;But I&#x27;m not the true target. I never was.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Victoria,&quot; Alexander said softly.<br/><br/>Camille nodded, the pieces falling into place. &quot;Herod wanted revenge against Victoria for destroying his family. He researched her, found her connection to me, and then found the perfect person to help him strike at Victoria through me.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Rose.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Exactly.&quot; Camille felt a chill despite the warmth of the kitchen. &quot;Which means we&#x27;ve been looking at this all wrong. We&#x27;ve been treating Rose as the primary threat, with Herod as her powerful ally. But it&#x27;s the reverse.&quot;<br/><br/>They returned to the table with their refreshed drinks. Outside, the sky had begun to lighten imperceptibly, the deep black softening toward dark blue.<br/><br/>&quot;If you&#x27;re right,&quot; Alexander said, &quot;then Rose might not even understand the full scope of Herod&#x27;s plans.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No. She thinks this is about destroying me. About taking back what she believes I stole from her.&quot; Camille wrapped her hands around her mug. &quot;But for Herod, it&#x27;s about Victoria. About making her suffer the way he suffered when she destroyed his family.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s expression grew grave. &quot;And the most effective way to hurt Victoria now...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Is through me,&quot; Camille finished. &quot;Her heir. Her adoptive daughter. The one thing she truly cares about.&quot;<br/><br/>The realization hung between them in the quiet kitchen. Dawn was approaching, but the shadows seemed deeper than before.<br/><br/>&quot;My nightmare makes sense now,&quot; Camille said softly. &quot;Rose pulling me down isn&#x27;t the real danger. It&#x27;s Herod, patient, hidden, with a plan we still don&#x27;t fully understand.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander reached across the table, taking her hand again. &quot;We&#x27;ll figure it out. Together.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded, drawing strength from his touch. But the nightmare&#x27;s dread still clung to her like a second skin.<br/><br/>&quot;Four days until the Grid launch,&quot; she said. &quot;Whatever they&#x27;re planning, it&#x27;s coming soon.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Victoria has the shadow engineering team working around the clock to undo the sabotage. The Grid will be secure.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;But what if the Grid isn&#x27;t the endgame? What if it&#x27;s just another distraction?&quot; Camille met his gaze directly. &quot;The stock purchases. The sabotage. Martin Greene&#x27;s betrayal. What if they&#x27;re all just pieces of something larger?&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander didn&#x27;t dismiss her concerns. &quot;Then we need to find the pattern.&quot;<br/><br/>He pulled out his phone, sending a quick text. A moment later, his phone buzzed with a response.<br/><br/>&quot;Victoria wants to meet at seven. Full strategic briefing.&quot; He looked up at Camille. &quot;She&#x27;s been up all night too, apparently.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;She feels it too,&quot; Camille said. &quot;The danger closing in.&quot;<br/><br/>They sat in silence as the first rays of sunrise began to filter through the kitchen windows. The night&#x27;s shadows retreated, but the sense of lurking threat remained.<br/><br/>Camille thought of her nightmare, of being pulled under dark water, of fighting for breath, of Rose and Herod dragging her down. Now the dream&#x27;s meaning seemed clearer, more ominous.<br/><br/>It wasn&#x27;t just about drowning. It was about time running out.<br/><br/>Four days until the Grid launch. Four days for them to uncover whatever Herod was truly planning.<br/><br/>Four days for Camille to ensure that her nightmare remained just that, a dream, not a prophecy.<br/><br/>But as she looked into Alexander&#x27;s worried eyes, she couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that whatever was coming would be worse than anything she had imagined. And unlike her nightmare, there would be no waking up from it.<br/></div>
