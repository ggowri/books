        <h1>Chapter 41</h1>
        <div><p>Chapter 41<br/><br/>Camille&#x27;s point of view <br/><br/>The Metropolitan Finance Summit filled the grand ballroom of the Plaza Hotel, crystal chandeliers casting golden light over Manhattan&#x27;s elite. I moved through the crowd with practiced grace, my black Dior dress drawing appreciative glances. Every step, every gesture, every smile carefully calculated to project the image of Victoria Kane&#x27;s perfect heir.<br/><br/>Inside, though, my mind raced with numbers and plans. Rodriguez Shipping&#x27;s Asia division lay vulnerable after our last attack. Tonight&#x27;s event offered perfect hunting grounds, worried investors ready to jump ship, competitors eager to grab market share, reporters hungry for insider tips.<br/><br/>&quot;Searching for your next victim, Ms. Kane?&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s voice behind me sent an unexpected shiver down my spine. I hadn&#x27;t heard him approach, unusual for someone trained by Victoria to always track potential threats. But Alexander Pierce had a way of slipping past my defenses.<br/><br/>&quot;Mr. Pierce.&quot; I turned, finding him closer than expected. &quot;I didn&#x27;t think finance summits were your preferred hunting ground.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;They aren&#x27;t.&quot; His gray eyes held that knowing look that always made me feel exposed. &quot;But I heard interesting rumors about Rodriguez Shipping&#x27;s stock taking quite a tumble. Tragic.&quot;<br/><br/>His tone suggested he knew exactly how tragic it wasn&#x27;t. I kept my expression neutral despite my racing heart. &quot;The market can be unpredictable.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Can it?&quot; He accepted two champagne glasses from a passing waiter, offering me one with elegant precision. &quot;Nothing about you seems unpredictable, Ms. Kane. Every move...&quot; his eyes met mine over the rim of his glass, &quot;perfectly calculated.&quot;<br/><br/>The way he emphasized &#x27;perfectly&#x27; sent warning signals through my mind. How much did he really know? About my plans? About my true identity? About everything?<br/><br/>&quot;You seem very interested in my movements, Mr. Pierce.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Alexander,&quot; he corrected softly. &quot;And yes, I find you... fascinating.&quot;<br/><br/>Heat crept up my neck, and I silently cursed my body&#x27;s betrayal. This wasn&#x27;t part of Victoria&#x27;s careful programming. She hadn&#x27;t prepared me for the way Alexander Pierce could unsettle my walls with just a look, just a word.<br/><br/>&quot;Why fascinating?&quot; I sipped my champagne, using the moment to steady myself.<br/><br/>His eyes never left mine. &quot;Because beneath all this...&quot; he gestured to my designer dress, my perfect makeup, my polished manner, &quot;there&#x27;s something real. Something true. Something that hasn&#x27;t forgotten how to feel.&quot;<br/><br/>My hand tightened on the delicate champagne stem. &quot;You presume a lot about someone you barely know.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Do I?&quot; He stepped closer, his cologne teasing my senses. &quot;Tell me, when Rodriguez Shipping&#x27;s stock crashed today, did it satisfy the hunger inside you? Or did it just make you hungrier?&quot;<br/><br/>Ice slid through my veins even as heat pooled in my stomach. He knew. Somehow he knew everything. But instead of fear, I felt... relief? Finally someone who saw through the mask, who understood the fire burning beneath my skin.<br/><br/>&quot;I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No?&quot; His smile widened slightly. &quot;Then why is your pulse racing? I can see it...&quot; his eyes dropped to my throat, &quot;right here.&quot;<br/><br/>I forced myself to step back, to remember my purpose. Victoria&#x27;s training screamed at me to retreat, to maintain distance, to protect the mission. &quot;You&#x27;re very forward, Mr. Pierce.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Alexander,&quot; he corrected again, following my retreat with a fluid step forward. &quot;And you&#x27;re very evasive, Camille. May I call you Camille?&quot;<br/><br/>The way he said my name... like a caress... like a secret... made my skin tingle. No one said my name that way anymore. Not since I&#x27;d buried Camille Lewis and risen as Camille Kane.<br/><br/>&quot;If you must.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I must.&quot; He glanced around the crowded ballroom before leaning close to whisper, &quot;Just like I must warn you, revenge is a fire that burns both ways. Be careful you don&#x27;t lose yourself in the flames.&quot;<br/><br/>Before I could respond, he disappeared into the crowd with the same silent grace he&#x27;d appeared. I stood frozen, champagne forgotten in my hand, his words echoing in my mind.<br/><br/>The rest of the evening passed in a blur. I went through the motions, networking, gathering information, planting seeds for our next move against Stefan&#x27;s company. But my mind kept returning to that moment with Alexander, to the way he&#x27;d seen straight through my carefully constructed facade.<br/><br/>Later, in my private car heading home, I found myself smiling despite the seriousness of his warning. The way he&#x27;d teased me, challenged me, understood me... it awakened something I thought had died when I let Victoria remake me.<br/><br/>My phone buzzed, a message from her confirming tomorrow&#x27;s strategy meeting about Rodriguez Shipping&#x27;s Asia division. I should have been focused on that, on the next phase of our plan, on the systematic destruction of Stefan&#x27;s world.<br/><br/>Instead, I kept hearing Alexander&#x27;s voice: &quot;Something real. Something true.&quot;<br/><br/>When had anyone last seen me that way? Not as Victoria&#x27;s creation, not as Stefan&#x27;s ex-wife, not as Rose&#x27;s forgotten sister, not as the Lewis forgotten heiress. Just... me.<br/><br/>My fingers touched my throat where he&#x27;d noticed my pulse racing. Even now, hours later, the memory of his gaze made my heart beat faster. The scent of his cologne lingered on my dress where he&#x27;d stood close - cedar and leather and something uniquely him.<br/><br/>Dangerous, Victoria&#x27;s voice whispered in my mind. He&#x27;s a distraction. A complication. Remember why we started this. Remember what they did to you.<br/><br/>But for the first time since Victoria saved me, since I buried my old self and became her heir, I wondered if complications might be exactly what I needed. If maybe, just maybe, there was more to life than revenge.<br/><br/>My phone buzzed again. Alexander this time: *Next time you plan to crash a stock, warn me. I do so enjoy watching you work.*<br/><br/>I caught myself smiling again, and this time I didn&#x27;t try to stop it. Something warm unfurled in my chest, not the cold satisfaction of revenge, but something softer. Something that felt dangerously like hope.<br/><br/>Tomorrow would bring more battles, more strategies, more steps toward destroying those who had destroyed me. But tonight... tonight I let myself remember how it felt to be seen. Really seen.<br/><br/>My phone lit up with one final message from Alexander: *Sweet dreams, little warrior. Try not to topple any empires before breakfast.*<br/><br/>This time, my laugh surprised even me.</p></div>
