        <h1>Chapter 129-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 129<br/><br/>Herod stared at his computer screen, forehead creased with confusion. The data from Walsh&#x27;s latest information drop sat before him, schematics of the Phoenix Grid&#x27;s western junction, maintenance logs, security protocols, power flow diagrams. Everything they would need to exploit the supposed vulnerability during the launch ceremony.<br/><br/>It looked perfect. Too perfect.<br/><br/>He zoomed in on a section of the access codes, his suspicion growing with each passing second. He had spent decades in the technology sector before turning his attention to Victoria Kane. He knew systems architecture like others knew their childhood homes. And something about these files felt wrong.<br/><br/>&quot;What&#x27;s the matter?&quot; Rose asked, entering his home office with a cup of coffee. Her movements were jagged, tense, like a loaded spring ready to snap. Her obsession with Camille&#x27;s engagement had only worsened over the past two days.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m not sure yet,&quot; Herod murmured, not looking up from the screen. He pulled up another file, comparing the two side by side. &quot;Something about Walsh&#x27;s information doesn&#x27;t add up.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose set the coffee down harder than necessary, liquid sloshing over the rim. &quot;What do you mean, doesn&#x27;t add up? We paid him enough, it better be accurate.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s just it,&quot; Herod said, pointing to a sequence of code. &quot;It&#x27;s too perfect. Look here, the vulnerability is exactly where we would want it to be. The access points are clearly marked. The security protocols have an obvious bypass method.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And that&#x27;s... bad?&quot; Rose&#x27;s voice held a dangerous edge. Her patience had worn thin since learning of Camille&#x27;s engagement.<br/><br/>Herod leaned back in his chair, rubbing his eyes. &quot;In my experience, real system vulnerabilities are never this convenient. They&#x27;re buried in complex code, hidden behind layers of security, difficult to identify without specialized knowledge.&quot;<br/><br/>He clicked through several more files, his unease growing stronger. &quot;This looks like someone gift-wrapped a way into the Grid and handed it to us. That never happens by accident.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s hand clenched around the coffee mug. &quot;Are you saying we&#x27;ve been played?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s possible.&quot; Herod opened an encrypted folder on his hard drive, pulling up older files, the original Grid schematics they had obtained months ago, before Walsh&#x27;s employment. He began comparing the two sets of data, looking for inconsistencies.<br/><br/>Minutes passed in tense silence. Rose paced behind him, her reflection visible in the window across from his desk. With each circuit of the room, her movements grew more agitated.<br/><br/>&quot;There,&quot; Herod finally said, pointing to the screen. &quot;The power relay configuration in the original schematics doesn&#x27;t match what Walsh provided. According to his information, there&#x27;s a bypass circuit that could be overloaded during peak usage, creating a cascade failure.&quot;<br/><br/>He pulled up the original diagram. &quot;But in the actual design, that bypass doesn&#x27;t exist. It&#x27;s been added to the files Walsh gave us.&quot;<br/><br/>The coffee mug shattered against the wall, making Herod flinch. Rose stood with her arm still extended from the throw, her face contorted with rage.<br/><br/>&quot;They know,&quot; she hissed. &quot;They&#x27;ve been feeding us false information.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod nodded grimly. &quot;Not just false information. Targeted misinformation. They identified Walsh as our inside man and used him to feed us exactly what they wanted us to see.&quot;<br/><br/>He continued searching through the files, looking for further evidence. &quot;The question is when they figured it out. How long have they been playing us?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Does it matter?&quot; Rose snapped. &quot;Our plan is ruined. If we try to exploit this fake vulnerability during the launch ceremony, we&#x27;ll walk straight into a trap.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod didn&#x27;t answer immediately. His fingers moved rapidly across the keyboard, running a specialized scanning program over Walsh&#x27;s files. The program was designed to detect hidden code, embedded tracking software, digital fingerprints, anything that might reveal the true nature of the data.<br/><br/>The scan completed. Results appeared on screen. Herod&#x27;s blood ran cold.<br/><br/>&quot;They&#x27;ve embedded trackers in these files,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;Sophisticated ones. The moment we opened them, they activated.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Meaning what, exactly?&quot; Rose&#x27;s voice had dropped to a dangerous whisper.<br/><br/>&quot;Meaning they know we have this information. They know we&#x27;ve looked at it. And they&#x27;re tracking our location right now.&quot; He began shutting down systems, disconnecting from networks. &quot;We need to move. This place is compromised.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose didn&#x27;t move, her body rigid with fury. &quot;That bitch,&quot; she breathed. &quot;She&#x27;s been two steps ahead of us this whole time.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Not the whole time,&quot; Herod corrected, still working to secure his systems. &quot;Just since they identified Walsh. The question is what else they know.&quot;<br/><br/>He opened a secure line to Walsh&#x27;s phone. The call went straight to voicemail. He tried again with the same result.<br/><br/>&quot;Walsh isn&#x27;t answering,&quot; he reported. &quot;Either they&#x27;ve already gotten to him, or he&#x27;s realized something&#x27;s wrong and is running.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose slammed her palms on his desk, leaning over to stare directly into his eyes. &quot;Fix this, Herod. You promised me Camille&#x27;s destruction. You promised me she would pay for everything she took from me.&quot;<br/><br/>The desperation in her voice was matched only by the dangerous gleam in her eyes. Herod recognized the look, the same one she&#x27;d worn when she&#x27;d learned of Camille&#x27;s engagement. Rose was reaching her breaking point.</div>
