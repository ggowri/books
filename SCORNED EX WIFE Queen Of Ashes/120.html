        <h1>Chapter 85-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 85<br/><br/>Rose stepped out of the black sedan, her eyes adjusting to the fading daylight as she gazed up at the gleaming skyscraper. The doorman nodded respectfully as she entered the marble lobby, her heels clicking against the polished floor,the last vestige of her former life&#x27;s confidence. <br/><br/>The private elevator climbed sixty floors without stopping. She studied her reflection in the mirrored walls, barely recognizing the woman staring back. Her cheekbones jutted sharply beneath skin that had lost its glow. Dark circles shadowed her eyes. Only her expression remained unchanged, cold determination etched into every line.<br/><br/>&quot;You made it,&quot; Herod Preston said as the elevator doors slid open directly into his penthouse. He stood framed against floor-to-ceiling windows, Manhattan sprawled behind him like a glittering carpet. &quot;Welcome to your new home.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Temporary arrangement,&quot; Rose corrected, stepping into the vast space. Her gaze swept across Italian furniture, original artwork, and views that stretched to the horizon. &quot;Until I reclaim what&#x27;s mine.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod&#x27;s smile didn&#x27;t reach his eyes. &quot;Of course.&quot; He moved to a bar cart of gleaming brass and crystal. &quot;Drink?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Bourbon. Neat.&quot;<br/><br/>He poured two glasses and handed one to Rose. &quot;To new beginnings.&quot;<br/><br/>She ignored the toast, drinking deeply instead. The amber liquid burned down her throat, a welcome distraction from the constant ache of humiliation. &quot;This isn&#x27;t charity, is it? I need to understand exactly what you want.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Direct. I appreciate that.&quot; Herod gestured toward a sitting area. &quot;Please.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose sank into a leather chair, keeping her spine rigid. She&#x27;d been living in a run-down motel for weeks, surviving on cash she&#x27;d hidden away. Pride had kept her from accepting help until desperation won out. Now she sat in luxury again, but as a beggar, not an owner.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ve been watching Victoria Kane for a decade,&quot; Herod said, settling across from her. &quot;Planning, waiting for the right moment to strike.&quot; His fingers tapped rhythmically against the glass. &quot;Your situation creates an opportunity for us both.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You mentioned your brother at our first meeting. Charles, was it?&quot;<br/><br/>Herod&#x27;s expression darkened. &quot;Yes. Charles Preston. Engaged to Victoria&#x27;s precious Sophia.&quot; He reached into his jacket and withdrew a silver frame, sliding it across the table. &quot;That&#x27;s them.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose studied the photograph of a handsome young man with Herod&#x27;s features standing beside a smiling blonde woman. &quot;So Victoria blamed your family for Sophia&#x27;s accident.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It wasn&#x27;t an accident. Not entirely.&quot; Herod&#x27;s voice dropped. &quot;My father disapproved of the match. He pressured Charles to end it. When that failed, he arranged to have Sophia... frightened. The driver was instructed to run her off the road, just enough to scare her away from our family.&quot; His knuckles whitened around his glass. &quot;Things went wrong. The car flipped. Sophia died instantly.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And Victoria discovered this?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;She knew. Couldn&#x27;t prove it legally, but she knew.&quot; Herod&#x27;s laugh held no humor. &quot;Within six months, our shipping company faced regulatory investigations, contract cancellations, mysterious equipment failures. Our stock plummeted. My father&#x27;s reputation was systematically destroyed. He jumped from this very building eighteen months later.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose felt a chill despite the room&#x27;s warmth. &quot;And Charles?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Found hanging in his apartment after Victoria leaked documents suggesting he&#x27;d orchestrated the accident himself.&quot; Herod finished his drink in one swallow. &quot;Victoria Kane doesn&#x27;t just take revenge, she obliterates everything you love while forcing you to watch.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose understood completely. She&#x27;d witnessed the same methodical destruction of her own life, her fashion empire dismantled, her reputation shredded, her social standing erased. All orchestrated by the sister she&#x27;d tried to eliminate.<br/><br/>&quot;So you want revenge,&quot; she said. &quot;Just like me.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Justice,&quot; Herod corrected, pouring himself another drink. &quot;I want justice for my family. And I&#x27;ve spent ten years building the resources to get it.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What resources? I heard your family lost everything.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We lost the Preston name and fortune. But I was already building my own holdings under different companies.&quot; His eyes gleamed with dark pride. &quot;Victoria was so focused on destroying what my father built, she never noticed the new enterprises emerging around her. I control shipping routes in eight countries now, with shares in twenty major ports. All through shell corporations Victoria hasn&#x27;t connected to me.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose leaned forward. &quot;And you need me because...?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Because Victoria has never been more vulnerable than she is right now.&quot; Herod set his glass down with precision. &quot;She&#x27;s exposed herself by bringing Camille forward publicly. Created a weakness where none existed before.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Camille is my target,&quot; Rose said sharply. &quot;I need to be clear about that.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Our goals align perfectly.&quot; Herod smiled. &quot;Victoria loves Camille like the daughter she lost. Destroying Camille destroys Victoria. And destroying Victoria allows me to reclaim everything she took from my family.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;How exactly do we do that?&quot; Rose asked. &quot;Camille has Victoria&#x27;s resources, Kane Industries&#x27; security. I can&#x27;t even get close to her without...&quot;</div>
