        <h1>Chapter 89-2</h1>
        <div><br/>Stefan laughed bitterly. &quot;And who would believe me? The cheating ex-husband? I&#x27;m hardly a credible source.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You&#x27;re the only one who lived with her daily for years,&quot; Alexander countered. &quot;Your testimony carries weight precisely because you have no reason to defend her. Everyone knows she hates you.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan winced at the blunt assessment. &quot;Thanks for that reminder.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m not here to spare your feelings,&quot; Alexander said. &quot;I&#x27;m here because Camille is being destroyed by lies, and you&#x27;re one of the few people who can help stop it.&quot;<br/><br/>Silence fell between them. Stefan drained his glass, setting it down with a decisive click.<br/><br/>&quot;What exactly would I need to do?&quot; he asked finally.<br/><br/>Alexander felt a surge of cautious hope. &quot;Hold a press conference. Tomorrow, before the morning shows air that interview with the Lewis parents. Publicly refute every claim Rose has made about Camille&#x27;s mental state. Confirm that Rose was always the manipulative one.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And admit my role in all this,&quot; Stefan added. &quot;Admit I betrayed a perfectly sane, loving wife for a lie.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan moved back to the window, his silhouette dark against the gray afternoon light. &quot;You know what the hardest part of losing everything is? It&#x27;s not the money or the status. It&#x27;s losing the lies you tell yourself. The stories that let you sleep at night.&quot;<br/><br/>He turned back to Alexander. &quot;I told myself Camille and I were already broken before Rose. That I fell in love with Rose naturally, not because she orchestrated it. That Camille would be fine without me.&quot; His laugh was hollow. &quot;All lies.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander waited, sensing Stefan needed to process this moment in his own way.<br/><br/>&quot;And now,&quot; Stefan continued, &quot;now that I&#x27;ve lost it all anyway, those lies don&#x27;t protect me anymore. I see everything clearly. Too clearly.&quot; He looked directly at Alexander. &quot;I see what I threw away. What you found.&quot;<br/><br/>The two men studied each other, former rivals now linked by their connection to the same woman.<br/><br/>&quot;If I do this,&quot; Stefan said slowly, &quot;I&#x27;m not doing it for you. Or even for Camille, really. She doesn&#x27;t need my help to be extraordinary.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Why, then?&quot; Alexander asked.<br/><br/>&quot;Because it&#x27;s true,&quot; Stefan said simply. &quot;And I&#x27;ve told enough lies in my life.&quot; He straightened his shoulders. &quot;I&#x27;ll hold your press conference. Tell the world exactly who Rose Lewis is, and who Camille really was.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander nodded, relief washing through him. &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Don&#x27;t thank me,&quot; Stefan warned. &quot;I&#x27;m not doing this to help you win her.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s not why I&#x27;m here.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Isn&#x27;t it?&quot; Stefan&#x27;s eyes were knowing. &quot;You love her. You want to protect her. I understand that drive better than you think.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander changed tactics. &quot;If you&#x27;re going to do this, it needs to be tomorrow morning. Early. Before the Lewis parents&#x27; interview airs.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It will be.&quot; Stefan&#x27;s voice strengthened with resolve. &quot;I&#x27;ll contact my uncle&#x27;s former PR team tonight. Nine AM press conference. Major networks.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I can handle the arrangements,&quot; Alexander offered.<br/><br/>&quot;No.&quot; Stefan&#x27;s refusal was firm. &quot;If I&#x27;m doing this, I&#x27;m doing it my way. Not as Alexander Pierce&#x27;s puppet.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander conceded with a nod. &quot;Fair enough. But the timing is crucial.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I understand.&quot; Stefan moved to his laptop, already typing. &quot;Nine AM. The Rodriguez name still carries enough weight to get media attention, even if our ships don&#x27;t sail anymore.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander took out a business card and placed it on the table. &quot;My private number. Call when it&#x27;s arranged.&quot;<br/><br/>As he turned to leave, Stefan&#x27;s voice stopped him at the door.<br/><br/>&quot;Pierce. One more thing.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander looked back questioningly.<br/><br/>&quot;Do you ever wonder,&quot; Stefan asked, &quot;if Camille is using you the way Victoria used her? If beneath all that love you feel, you&#x27;re just another chess piece in their revenge game?&quot;<br/><br/>The question cut closer to Alexander&#x27;s private doubts than he cared to admit. &quot;Camille isn&#x27;t Victoria.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No,&quot; Stefan agreed. &quot;But she learned from the master. Just... be careful. That&#x27;s all.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander left without responding, the warning echoing in his mind as he descended the shabby stairwell.<br/><br/>Outside, the cool air cleared his head. He had accomplished his mission, Stefan would speak for Camille. Yet he felt unsettled, not just by Stefan&#x27;s parting words but by his own confession.<br/><br/>Yes, I&#x27;m in love with her.<br/><br/>He hadn&#x27;t said those words aloud before, not even to himself. Now they hung in the air, spoken first to her ex-husband of all people. The irony wasn&#x27;t lost on him.<br/><br/>His phone rang as he slid into the backseat of his waiting car. Camille&#x27;s name flashed on the screen.<br/><br/>&quot;Where have you been?&quot; she asked without preamble. &quot;Victoria said you called it urgent.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander glanced back at Stefan&#x27;s apartment building, wondering how to explain what he&#x27;d just set in motion.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ve been working on a counterattack,&quot; he said carefully. &quot;One that might turn the tide in our favor.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What kind of counterattack?&quot; Suspicion colored her voice.<br/><br/>Alexander made a split-second decision. If Stefan backed out, telling Camille now would only give her false hope.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ll explain everything tonight,&quot; he promised. &quot;For now, just know that by this time tomorrow, Rose&#x27;s story will be unraveling.&quot;<br/><br/>There was a pause on the line. &quot;Alexander,&quot; Camille said finally, her voice softening. &quot;Thank you. For fighting for me.&quot;<br/><br/>The simple gratitude caught him off guard, warming something in his chest. &quot;Always,&quot; he replied, the word carrying more weight than she knew.<br/><br/>As he ended the call, his driver glanced in the rearview mirror. &quot;Where to, sir?&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander looked out at the Brooklyn streets, seeing not the present but the future,tomorrow&#x27;s headlines, Rose&#x27;s reactions, Victoria&#x27;s calculations. And Camille, caught in the center of it all.<br/><br/>&quot;Back to Manhattan,&quot; he said firmly. &quot;We have a war to win.&quot;<br/><br/>Behind him, Stefan Rodriguez stood at his third-floor window, watching Alexander&#x27;s car pull away. His expression was unreadable as he picked up his phone and dialed a number he hadn&#x27;t used in weeks.<br/><br/>&quot;Karen? It&#x27;s Stefan Rodriguez. I need to arrange a press conference for tomorrow morning. Nine AM sharp.&quot; He paused, listening. &quot;Yes, it&#x27;s about Camille Lewis. And no, this isn&#x27;t a joke. It&#x27;s about time someone told the truth.&quot;<br/></div>
