        <h1>Chapter 63-2</h1>
        <div><br/>I looked up sharply. &quot;What kind of scandal?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The kind that would make your parents reconsider their support. The kind that would make Stefan question his choice.&quot; Victoria tapped her fingers against her desk, a habit I knew indicated she was carefully considering her next words.<br/><br/>My breath caught. &quot;That is a good plan&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Recently, I acquired proof and witnesses of all of Rose scandals&quot; Victoria&#x27;s expression was unreadable. &quot;I held it in reserve, uncertain if such a personal attack would serve our larger goals. But now...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Now it&#x27;s exactly what we need,&quot; I finished, a cold clarity replacing the emotional turmoil I&#x27;d felt moments before. &quot;Evidence that Rose is not a saint.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Show me,&quot; I demanded, leaning toward the screen. &quot;Show me what you have.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;When I return tomorrow. This isn&#x27;t something to discuss over even our most secure channels.&quot; Victoria&#x27;s expression softened again, nearly imperceptible but there for those who knew how to read her. &quot;For now, maintain appearances. The charity luncheon at the Botanical Gardens is still on your schedule for today.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m not in the mood for smiling at socialites.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Nevertheless, you will attend.&quot; Victoria&#x27;s tone brooked no argument, maternal authority overlaying business command. &quot;Now more than ever, Camille Kane must appear unaffected by Rodriguez-Lewis affairs. Any reaction could raise questions we don&#x27;t want asked.&quot;<br/><br/>After ending the call, I showered and dressed mechanically, donning a pale blue suit that Rebecca had selected for the luncheon. My outward appearance perfectly matched what was expected of Victoria Kane&#x27;s heir, polished, professional, poised.<br/><br/>Inside, I was burning.<br/><br/>My car was waiting when I descended the mansion&#x27;s grand staircase. James stood by the open door, his expression professionally blank as always.<br/><br/>&quot;The Botanical Gardens, Ms. Kane?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No,&quot; I decided suddenly. &quot;Take me to the Rodriguez estate first.&quot;<br/><br/>James hesitated, unusual for him. &quot;Ms. Kane, the property is no longer...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I know it&#x27;s no longer in Rodriguez hands. I know we own it. I just... need to see it.&quot;<br/><br/>He nodded, closing my door before sliding into the driver&#x27;s seat. As the car wound through exclusive neighborhoods where Manhattan&#x27;s elite maintained their family compounds, I stared out the window without really seeing the passing scenery.<br/><br/>The Rodriguez estate had been in their family for five generations. I&#x27;d lived there for three years as Stefan&#x27;s wife, trying desperately to fit into spaces that had never truly welcomed me. Now it stood empty, another asset in Kane Industries&#x27; portfolio, another piece of the Rodriguez legacy stripped away.<br/><br/>Except now Stefan was rebuilding that legacy. With Rose by his side. With my parents&#x27; money and blessing.<br/><br/>The car slowed as we approached the private road leading to the estate. James paused at the security gate, showing identification to the guard Victoria had stationed there.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;re just driving past,&quot; he explained. &quot;Ms. Kane wanted to view the property.&quot;<br/><br/>The guard nodded, raising the barrier to allow us through. <br/><br/>The driveway curved through manicured grounds, revealing the mansion gradually as we approached. Colonial architecture, white columns, windows gleaming in the morning sunlight. It looked exactly as I remembered from my years living there, except for the stillness. No staff moving about the grounds. No cars in the circular drive. Just empty perfection, preserved like a museum exhibit.<br/><br/>&quot;Stop here,&quot; I instructed as we reached the front of the house.<br/><br/>&quot;Would you like to go inside, Ms. Kane? I have the access codes.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No.&quot; I wasn&#x27;t ready for that, wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d ever be ready to walk through rooms filled with memories of my failed marriage. &quot;This is close enough.&quot;<br/><br/>Through the car window, I studied the home that had never truly felt like mine despite my best efforts. Stefan&#x27;s mother had made sure of that, with her constant remarks about traditions I didn&#x27;t understand and standards I couldn&#x27;t quite meet. Even the furniture had belonged to previous Rodriguez wives, selected and arranged generations before I arrived.<br/><br/>Rose would fit perfectly here. Would know exactly how to play the role of Rodriguez wife, just as she&#x27;d always excelled at being the perfect Lewis daughter.<br/><br/>The thought sent fresh pain spiraling through me.<br/><br/>&quot;They&#x27;re not moving back here,&quot; I said aloud, decision crystallizing as I spoke. &quot;Even if the new business succeeds. Even if the wedding proceeds. They will never live in this house again.&quot;<br/><br/>James met my eyes in the rearview mirror. &quot;What would you like done with the property, Ms. Kane?&quot;<br/><br/>I considered the question, looking at the grand house that represented everything the Rodriguez name stood for, tradition, wealth, unbroken lineage.<br/><br/>&quot;Sell it,&quot; I said finally. &quot;Not to another family. To developers. I want it torn down, the land divided into smaller lots.&quot;<br/><br/>James nodded, making a note on his phone. He didn&#x27;t question the decision that would erase a historic property, didn&#x27;t comment on the destructiveness of the order. Victoria hired people who followed instructions without judgment.<br/><br/>&quot;Now the Botanical Gardens,&quot; I said, turning away as we pulled back down the driveway. &quot;I have a charity luncheon to attend.&quot;<br/></div>
