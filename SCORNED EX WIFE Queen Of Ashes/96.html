        <h1>Chapter 71-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 71<br/><br/>The elevator climbed toward the penthouse of Pierce Tower, each floor ticking by on the digital display as my stomach tightened with a mix of anger and nervous anticipation. I wore a simple black dress, nothing flashy, nothing designed to impress, and carried the folder containing evidence of Alexander&#x27;s secret involvement in my revenge.<br/><br/>When the doors opened, I stepped into a space unlike anything I&#x27;d expected. Not the cold, modernist showcase typical of billionaire penthouses, but a warm, wood-paneled sanctuary with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves and comfortable leather furniture. Classical music played softly in the background. The wall of windows offered a breathtaking view of Manhattan at sunset, the city transformed into gold and shadow.<br/><br/>Alexander stood by a small bar cart, his back to me. He&#x27;d removed his suit jacket and rolled up his shirtsleeves, looking more approachable than I&#x27;d ever seen him.<br/><br/>&quot;Scotch? Wine? Something else?&quot; he asked without turning.<br/><br/>&quot;Answers,&quot; I replied, my voice steadier than I felt.<br/><br/>He turned then, a slight smile on his face that didn&#x27;t quite reach his eyes. &quot;Straight to business. One of the many things I admire about you.&quot;<br/><br/>I tossed the folder onto his coffee table. Papers spilled out, financial records, surveillance reports, market manipulation evidence, all documenting his shadow campaign against Rose and Stefan.<br/><br/>&quot;Explain this,&quot; I demanded, remaining standing even as he gestured toward a seat. &quot;Explain why you&#x27;ve been secretly helping destroy Rose and Stefan for the past year without telling me.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander studied me for a long moment, then moved to a bookshelf and pulled out a small wooden box. &quot;Perhaps we should start at the beginning.&quot;<br/><br/>He placed the box on the table between us and finally, I sat down across from him. He opened it carefully, removing what looked like a hospital ID bracelet, faded and worn.<br/><br/>&quot;Boston Memorial Hospital. Five years ago.&quot; He set the bracelet gently on top of the scattered papers. &quot;The night that changed everything.&quot;<br/><br/>I stared at the plastic band, confusion replacing some of my anger. &quot;What does this have to do with Rose and Stefan?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Everything.&quot; Alexander sat opposite me, his eyes never leaving my face. &quot;Five years ago, I was in a car accident on the Massachusetts Turnpike. Multiple vehicles. Three fatalities. I was trapped in the wreckage of my car, overlooked by first responders dealing with more visible victims.&quot;<br/><br/>A chill ran through me as fragments of memory stirred, a rainy night, flashing emergency lights, a medical conference in Boston I&#x27;d attended alone because my parents was too busy with work and perfect Rose.<br/><br/>&quot;I was bleeding internally,&quot; Alexander continued. &quot;The doctors later said I had minutes left, at most. Until someone insisted they check the less damaged vehicles. Someone who refused to leave until every person was accounted for.&quot;<br/><br/>My breath caught. &quot;That was you? In the black sedan?&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander nodded, something soft and vulnerable crossing his face. &quot;That was me. And you were the one who found me. Who rode in the ambulance. Who gave her information as emergency contact when no family came forward.&quot;<br/><br/>The memory crystallized, the barely conscious man, face bloody and unrecognizable. The hospital forms I&#x27;d filled out while waiting for news of his condition. The nurses telling me he had no visitors, no one asking about him.<br/><br/>&quot;I stayed in Boston three extra days,&quot; I whispered, the past rushing back. &quot;I visited your room. Read to you while you were unconscious.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;RISING EX WIFE : Love Me Again Mrs Graves,&quot; Alexander said softly. &quot;You said it was your favorite and the Author Annypen, was also your favorite&quot;<br/><br/>Tears stung my eyes unexpectedly. &quot;I never knew your name. The hospital just had a case number. And when I had to return to New York, to my family, I...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You left flowers. And a note.&quot; Alexander reached into the box again, removing a faded piece of hospital stationery. &quot;&#x27;Whoever you are, I hope you heal completely. Someone is thinking of you, even if you&#x27;re alone right now.&#x27;&quot;<br/><br/>My throat tightened at the sight of my own handwriting from years ago. &quot;I don&#x27;t understand. If that was you, why didn&#x27;t you tell me when we met?&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander moved to the window, gazing out at the darkening city. &quot;After I recovered, I tried to find you. All I had was a name, Camille Lewis, and the knowledge that you&#x27;d attended a medical conference in Boston. It took months, but I finally tracked you down.&quot;<br/><br/>He turned back to me, his expression both tender and pained. &quot;I came to New York, intent on thanking the woman who&#x27;d saved my life. But when I arrived...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I was married,&quot; I finished for him, understanding dawning.<br/><br/>&quot;To Stefan Rodriguez. Living what seemed to be a perfect life with a successful husband and budding design career.&quot; Alexander&#x27;s smile held no bitterness, only a gentle resignation. &quot;It didn&#x27;t seem right to intrude on that life, to complicate it with a stranger&#x27;s gratitude.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;So you left?&quot; The thought of how different things might have been made my heart ache.<br/><br/>&quot;I left. But I kept track of you from a distance. Just... checking occasionally to make sure the woman who&#x27;d shown such kindness to a stranger was happy.&quot; His voice dropped lower. &quot;Until I started noticing things. The way your husband looked at your sister when you weren&#x27;t watching. The business trips that coincided with her visits from London. The gradual distance growing between you.&quot;<br/><br/>A cold realization washed over me. &quot;You knew. Before it happened. You knew Stefan was betraying me with Rose.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander nodded, regret clear in his eyes. &quot;I was making arrangements to return to New York, to somehow warn you, when news broke about your accident. Your car going off that bridge. Your body never recovered.&quot;<br/><br/>He moved back to the sofa, sitting closer to me this time. &quot;I didn&#x27;t believe it. Couldn&#x27;t accept it. I hired investigators, had them looking into every aspect of that night. But then, A week later, I discovered something unexpected. You were alive.&quot;<br/><br/>My head snapped up. &quot;What do you mean? How could you possibly have known?&quot;</div>
