        <h1>Chapter 109-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 109<br/><br/>The Kane Industries private meeting room felt too small for the four people inside it. Camille sat at the head of the polished table, Victoria to her right, Alexander to her left. Stefan Rodriguez stood awkwardly near the door, as if unsure whether to step further in or keep his escape route close.<br/><br/>&quot;Sit, Mr. Rodriguez,&quot; Victoria said, her voice cold as winter steel. &quot;You requested this meeting. Let&#x27;s not waste time.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan lowered himself into a chair at the far end of the table. His once-confident posture had vanished, shoulders curving inward like a man carrying an invisible weight.<br/><br/>&quot;Thank you for seeing me,&quot; he said, his voice rougher than Camille remembered. &quot;I know I&#x27;m the last person you want to hear from.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Second to last,&quot; Victoria corrected. &quot;Your former lover ranks below you.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan flinched. &quot;That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here. I want to help stop Rose. And Preston.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s jaw tightened. His hand moved slightly closer to Camille&#x27;s on the table. &quot;And why would we need your help?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Because I know Rose. I know how she thinks.&quot; Stefan looked directly at Camille. &quot;I lived with her lies. I watched her manipulate everyone. And now that I see her clearly, I can tell you things that might help protect the Grid. Protect you.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille felt Alexander stiffen beside her. The slight shift in his posture, the almost imperceptible narrowing of his eyes—signs of jealousy only she would recognize.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;re already aware of the Grid sabotage,&quot; Camille said, keeping her voice neutral. &quot;Our engineers are correcting it.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s more than that.&quot; Stefan leaned forward. &quot;Rose doesn&#x27;t just want to damage the Grid. She wants to destroy you, Camille. Completely. And she has... patterns. Weaknesses in how she thinks.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s nails tapped against the tabletop. &quot;Such as?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;She needs to witness her victories,&quot; Stefan said quickly. &quot;It&#x27;s never enough for Rose to know she&#x27;s hurt someone. She has to see it happen. Watch their face when they realize they&#x27;ve lost.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille felt a chill race down her spine. Stefan was right. She remembered Rose&#x27;s eyes on her the day she&#x27;d discovered the divorce papers. The hungry gleam in them as she watched Camille&#x27;s world collapse.<br/><br/>&quot;Go on,&quot; Camille said quietly.<br/><br/>Alexander shifted, his shoulder brushing against hers. His posture remained protective, but something in his expression had changed. A reluctant recognition of the truth in Stefan&#x27;s words.<br/><br/>&quot;Rose has a fixation with control,&quot; Stefan continued. &quot;She needs to believe she&#x27;s the smartest person in the room. When something happens that she didn&#x27;t plan, she panics. Overreacts.&quot; He rubbed his jaw. &quot;Sometimes violently.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That matches our observations,&quot; Alexander admitted grudgingly.<br/><br/>&quot;There&#x27;s more. Rose surrounds herself with people she can manipulate. People like...&quot; He swallowed. &quot;People like me. But Herod Preston isn&#x27;t someone she can control. He has his own agenda, his own resources. That partnership is unstable.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s expression remained skeptical. &quot;And why are you suddenly so eager to betray Rose&#x27;s confidences? To help Camille, whom you betrayed so thoroughly?&quot;<br/><br/>The question hung in the air, heavy with accusation.<br/><br/>&quot;Because I have to live with what I did,&quot; Stefan said, his voice dropping. &quot;Every day. Because I watched Rose celebrate when everyone thought Camille was dead. Because I finally understand what kind of person she really is.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander studied Stefan, his initial jealousy visibly giving way to assessment. Camille recognized the shift,the businessman evaluating an asset, weighing risk against potential value.<br/><br/>&quot;What specifically do you think they&#x27;re planning?&quot; Alexander asked, his tone slightly less hostile.<br/><br/>&quot;I don&#x27;t know details,&quot; Stefan admitted. &quot;But after meeting Rose yesterday, I&#x27;m certain they&#x27;re planning something for the Grid launch itself. Something beyond the technical sabotage.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The launch ceremony,&quot; Camille said. &quot;Three hundred people will be there. City officials. Press.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Perfect audience for Rose&#x27;s theater of destruction,&quot; Stefan agreed. &quot;And perfect timing for Preston&#x27;s revenge against Victoria.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s face remained impassive, but Camille noticed the slight whitening of her knuckles, the only sign that Stefan&#x27;s words had affected her.<br/><br/>&quot;What else can you tell us about Rose&#x27;s vulnerabilities?&quot; Alexander pressed.<br/><br/>Stefan took a deep breath. &quot;She has three main weak points. First, she needs to witness suffering. Second, unexpected developments throw her off balance. And third...&quot; He hesitated, looking directly at Camille. &quot;She isn&#x27;t motivated by what most people think.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Explain,&quot; Camille said.<br/><br/>&quot;Everyone assumes Rose wants what you have, your husband, your family&#x27;s love, your success.&quot; Stefan&#x27;s voice softened. &quot;But that&#x27;s not it. What Rose really wants is to be you.&quot; <br/><br/>The words landed like stones in still water. All those years of sabotage, of undermining, of stealing what mattered to her, it hadn&#x27;t been simple jealousy. It had been something deeper. Rose hadn&#x27;t wanted Camille&#x27;s things. She had wanted Camille&#x27;s identity.<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s why nothing is ever enough for her,&quot; Stefan continued. &quot;No matter what she takes from you, she still wakes up as Rose, not Camille. And now that her true nature has been exposed...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;She wants to make sure I don&#x27;t have it either,&quot; Camille finished quietly.<br/><br/>&quot;Exactly. It&#x27;s not just revenge anymore. It&#x27;s erasure.&quot;</div>
