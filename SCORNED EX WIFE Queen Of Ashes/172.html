        <h1>Chapter 114-2</h1>
        <div><br/>&quot;Victoria Kane is the most stubborn woman I&#x27;ve ever met,&quot; he murmured against her hair. &quot;That includes you, which is saying something. She didn&#x27;t build an empire by giving up, and she won&#x27;t start now.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille allowed herself to be held, drawing strength from Alexander&#x27;s certainty. After a moment, she pulled back, wiping her eyes.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ve never seen you cry before,&quot; Alexander said quietly.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ve never let anyone see me cry since...&quot; She trailed off, thinking of the night she had signed those divorce papers, walked out of her marriage, and been attacked in that parking garage. The night that had ended Camille Lewis and begun Camille Kane.<br/><br/>&quot;Victoria taught me that emotion is weakness,&quot; she said.<br/><br/>Alexander shook his head. &quot;Victoria taught you that uncontrolled emotion is weakness. There&#x27;s a difference.&quot;<br/><br/>He brushed a strand of hair from her face with unexpected tenderness. &quot;What you&#x27;re feeling right now, fear of losing someone you love, someone who changed your life, that&#x27;s not weakness, Camille. It&#x27;s the core of what makes us human.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille took a deep breath, steadying herself. &quot;Victoria would say humanity is overrated.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander smiled slightly. &quot;Victoria says a lot of things. But she also took in a stranger who reminded her of her daughter, rebuilt her, and made her heir to everything she values. Those aren&#x27;t the actions of someone who doesn&#x27;t understand love.&quot;<br/><br/>A nurse appeared at the café entrance, scanning the room until she spotted them. &quot;Ms. Kane? They&#x27;ve taken Ms. Victoria to surgery now.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded, pulling herself together with visible effort. &quot;Thank you. I&#x27;ll be up shortly.&quot;<br/><br/>After the nurse left, Camille turned back to Alexander. &quot;Will you stay? During the surgery?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Of course,&quot; he replied without hesitation. &quot;As long as you need me.&quot;<br/><br/>She gathered Victoria&#x27;s folder from the table, hugging it to her chest. &quot;She left me notes. Things she wants me to know. I haven&#x27;t been able to read them yet.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Would it help if we read them together?&quot;<br/><br/>Camille considered the offer. The papers felt intensely private, a direct line to Victoria&#x27;s thoughts. But the idea of facing them alone seemed suddenly overwhelming.<br/><br/>&quot;Yes,&quot; she admitted. &quot;It would.&quot;<br/><br/>They walked to the private waiting room that had been prepared for them, a small space with comfortable furniture and windows overlooking the hospital gardens. Camille sat on the sofa, Alexander beside her, and opened the folder with trembling fingers.<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s handwriting filled the pages, elegant, precise strokes that reflected her personality. Camille began to read aloud, her voice soft in the quiet room.<br/><br/>&quot;Camille,&quot; she began, &quot;If you&#x27;re reading this, I am either in surgery or have not survived it. I prefer to believe the former, but I&#x27;ve never been one to ignore possibilities, however unpleasant.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille paused, steadying her voice before continuing.<br/><br/>&quot;There are practical matters addressed in these notes, strategies for dealing with the board, warnings about potential rivals, advice for the completion of the Phoenix Grid. All important, all necessary. But there are other things I need to say, things I&#x27;ve never found the right moment to tell you.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s hand found hers, warm and supportive.<br/><br/>&quot;When I found you that night, beaten and broken, I saw myself as I had been thirty years ago, a woman betrayed, left with nothing. I told myself I was helping you for Sophia&#x27;s sake, that saving you would somehow redeem my failure to protect my daughter. I was wrong.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille looked up, meeting Alexander&#x27;s gaze with surprise. Victoria Kane rarely admitted being wrong about anything.<br/><br/>&quot;I helped you because you deserved to be helped. Because the strength in you called to the strength in me. Because in your eyes, I saw not just pain but a fire that others had tried and failed to extinguish.&quot;<br/><br/>Tears threatened again. Camille blinked them back, determined to continue.<br/><br/>&quot;I have never been demonstrative. Emotion was a luxury I couldn&#x27;t afford when building Kane Industries. Perhaps I forgot how to express it along the way. But know this, Camille: In you, I found the daughter of my heart. Not a replacement for Sophia, no one could ever be that, but a second chance I never expected.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille&#x27;s voice broke on the last words. Alexander squeezed her hand, grounding her.<br/><br/>&quot;If I survive this surgery,&quot; she read on, &quot;I may never speak of these things again. Pride is a difficult habit to break, especially at my age. But I needed you to know, once and for all, that you are more than my heir. You are my legacy in the truest sense, not the buildings that bear my name or the company I built, but the remarkable woman you have become.&quot;<br/><br/>The letter continued with practical advice about the company, but Camille couldn&#x27;t read further. She closed the folder, pressing it to her heart, Victoria&#x27;s words echoing in her mind.<br/><br/>&quot;She never said any of this to me,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Not once.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Some people can only say certain things on paper,&quot; Alexander said gently. &quot;Or when they fear they&#x27;re running out of time.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded, understanding flooding through her. Victoria had given her so much, a new identity, a purpose, a future. And now, in these pages, she had given Camille something even more precious: the knowledge that she was truly loved.<br/><br/>&quot;She has to survive,&quot; Camille said, a new determination threading through her voice. &quot;She has to. Because I need to tell her...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Tell her what?&quot; Alexander prompted when she fell silent.<br/><br/>Camille looked toward the windows where dawn was beginning to break, pale light seeping through the rain clouds. &quot;That she saved me. Not just from Rose and Stefan, not just from being destroyed. She saved me from becoming like them, someone who only takes, who only destroys.&quot;<br/><br/>She turned to Alexander, her eyes bright with unshed tears and newfound clarity. &quot;Victoria Kane gave me back myself, and then she gave me a mother. A real one. I need her to know that before....&quot;<br/><br/>The door opened, and a doctor in surgical scrubs stood in the doorway. Camille froze, her heart hammering against her ribs. It was too soon. Far too soon for the surgery to be complete.<br/><br/>&quot;Ms. Kane?&quot; the doctor said. &quot;There&#x27;s been a development. You need to come with me right away.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille stood, Victoria&#x27;s folder clutched against her chest like armor. Alexander rose beside her, his hand at the small of her back, a silent promise of support.<br/><br/>Whatever waited beyond that door, hope or heartbreak, Camille would face it standing tall, just as Victoria had taught her. Because that&#x27;s what daughters did for their mothers. They made them proud, even in the darkest moments.<br/><br/>Especially then.<br/></div>
