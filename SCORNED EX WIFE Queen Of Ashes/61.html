        <h1>Chapter 49-2</h1>
        <div><br/>Alexander nodded his thanks, waiting until Marcus departed before opening the folder. Inside, photos showed Camille at various business meetings, charity functions, private dinners with Victoria. In each image, she appeared composed, confident, perfectly poised.<br/><br/>Only someone who knew what to look for would notice the slight tension around her eyes. The carefully controlled movements. The practiced smiles that never quite reached her gaze.<br/><br/>He recognized the signs because he&#x27;d once worn the same mask. The face of someone consumed by revenge, hollowed out by its demands, questioning what would remain when the fire of hatred finally burned out.<br/><br/>Alexander moved to a hidden panel in his office wall, pressing his palm against the biometric scanner. The wall slid open, revealing a private safe. Inside, alongside documents worth billions and secrets that could topple governments, lay a small velvet box.<br/><br/>He removed it carefully, opening the lid to reveal the silver rose pendant. Four years he&#x27;d carried it, waiting for the right moment to return it to the woman who&#x27;d sat beside his hospital bed. Who&#x27;d paid his medical bills when his family abandoned him. Who&#x27;d shown kindness when he had nothing to offer in return.<br/><br/>The woman who now walked a path of destruction, not knowing he followed behind, helping clear obstacles, ensuring her success. Watching her transform from victim to avenger.<br/><br/>His phone rang again, the secure line connected to his most sensitive operations.<br/><br/>&quot;Sir, Sterling Financial just announced an emergency audit of all shipping industry loans. Rodriguez Shipping stock is dropping in Asian markets.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Monitor the situation,&quot; Alexander instructed. &quot;And prepare the acquisition documents we discussed. When they hit rock bottom, I want to be ready to move.&quot;<br/><br/>Not to actually acquire anything, but to create the appearance of interest keeping other potential buyers away until Kane Industries could make their move. Another invisible thread pulled to aid Camille&#x27;s revenge.<br/><br/>Alexander returned the pendant to its safe, closing the hidden panel before moving back to his desk. His screens displayed the ongoing destruction of two lives, Rose&#x27;s fashion empire in tatters, Stefan&#x27;s shipping dynasty crumbling. All according to plan. All proceeding perfectly.<br/><br/>He picked up his phone, fingers hovering over the keys. For weeks, he&#x27;d maintained a careful distance, offering only cryptic texts, watching Camille&#x27;s revenge unfold from afar. Perhaps it was time for a more direct approach.<br/><br/>*The wolves circle the wounded prey. Both targets now seeking emergency financing, both being denied at every turn. Your move is proving most effective, little phoenix.*<br/><br/>He hesitated before sending it, knowing Victoria would disapprove of his involvement. Knowing Camille herself might resent his awareness of her plans. Knowing he was crossing a line between observer and participant.<br/><br/>But something in him needed her to know she wasn&#x27;t alone in this battle. That someone understood the cost of what she was doing. That someone saw beyond the mask she wore.<br/><br/>He pressed send, then turned back to the window, watching his reflection in the darkened glass. The man looking back was unreadable, controlled, powerful, everything he&#x27;d built himself to be after his own destruction and rebirth.<br/><br/>But beneath that carefully constructed exterior lay memories of a hospital room. Of gentle hands changing bandages. Of a quiet voice reading when pain kept him awake. Of kindness offered without expectation of return.<br/><br/>His phone chimed with a response from Camille: *How do you always know?*<br/><br/>Alexander smiled slightly, typing his reply: *The same way I know when the wind changes direction or the tide turns. Some forces can be felt rather than seen.*<br/><br/>Her response came quickly: *You&#x27;re a mystery I don&#x27;t have time to solve right now.*<br/><br/>*Yet solve me you will, one day. When your current quest is complete.*<br/><br/>He waited, watching three dots appear and disappear several times before her final message arrived: *What makes you think it will ever be complete?*<br/><br/>The question carried weight beyond its simple words. He recognized the fear beneath it, the same fear he&#x27;d once faced. What happens when revenge is achieved? What remains of the person you were? What fills the void when hatred no longer drives every decision?<br/><br/>*Because all fires eventually burn out, little phoenix. The question is what rises from the ashes.*<br/><br/>No response followed. He hadn&#x27;t expected one. Some questions had no easy answers, especially for someone still consumed by the flames.<br/><br/>Alexander returned to his desk, reviewing reports of the day&#x27;s successful manipulations. Eastern Capital had declined Rodriguez Shipping&#x27;s loan application, citing &quot;concerns about management stability.&quot; Three more investors had backed away from Rose&#x27;s fashion line after receiving anonymous information packets. Sterling Financial&#x27;s emergency audit was causing ripples of concern throughout the shipping industry.<br/><br/>All pieces moving exactly as planned. All contributing to the systematic destruction of two people who had once destroyed Camille Lewis.<br/><br/>Tomorrow would bring more of the same. More blocked investors. More leaked information. More careful manipulation of markets and opinions. All invisible, all untraceable, all designed to complement Camille&#x27;s more direct attacks.<br/><br/>His phone buzzed with a final text from Sarah: *Mission accomplished. Morgan Stanley will delay response to Rose Lewis until after the weekend. By then it will be too late for her production deadlines.*<br/><br/>Another victory. Another nail in the coffin of Rose&#x27;s fashion dreams.<br/><br/>Alexander closed his laptop, gathering his coat to leave. Tonight he would attend the same Metropolitan Museum fundraiser as Camille, watching her from across the room, their shared secret a silent bond neither acknowledged.<br/><br/>Tomorrow he would continue dismantling the financial foundations of her enemies, an unseen ally in her quest for justice. Or revenge. Or whatever she chose to call the fire consuming her.<br/><br/>And when it was over, when Rose and Stefan lay broken beyond repair, he would be waiting. Ready to help her answer the question she wasn&#x27;t yet ready to face.<br/><br/>What rises from the ashes when revenge is finally complete?<br/></div>
