        <div><br/>Frederick nodded, extracting a silver pen from his breast pocket. &quot;If you&#x27;ll initial here, Ms. Kane, and sign on the final page.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria took the pen, her hand steady as she marked the documents. The scratch of the nib against paper was the only sound in the room besides the quiet beeping of the monitors.<br/><br/>When she finished, she handed the pen to Camille. &quot;Your signature is required as witness and acknowledging recipient.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille hesitated, the pen heavy in her hand. Signing felt like admitting a possibility she refused to accept—that Victoria might not survive.<br/><br/>&quot;This changes nothing about tomorrow,&quot; Victoria said, reading her thoughts. &quot;It simply ensures that no matter what happens, you will be protected. Kane Industries will be protected.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille took a deep breath and signed her name. The letters seemed strange to her—Camille Kane—still somewhat unfamiliar after all this time. A name Victoria had given her, along with a new identity, a new purpose, and now, potentially, an empire.<br/><br/>Frederick collected the documents, slipping them into his briefcase. &quot;I&#x27;ll file these immediately. By this time tomorrow, everything will be legally binding.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria nodded. &quot;Thank you, Frederick. That will be all.&quot;<br/><br/>The lawyer stood, buttoning his jacket. &quot;If I may say so, Ms. Kane... it&#x27;s been an honor serving you these many years.&quot;<br/><br/>Something passed between them—thirty years of history distilled into a single look. Then Frederick bowed slightly and left the room, the door closing softly behind him.<br/><br/>Silence settled around them. Outside the window, the sun was beginning to set, painting the city skyline in shades of gold and amber.<br/><br/>&quot;You didn&#x27;t have to do this,&quot; Camille said finally.<br/><br/>&quot;Yes,&quot; Victoria countered. &quot;I did.&quot;<br/><br/>She shifted against the pillows, a flicker of discomfort crossing her features. &quot;When Sophia died, I lost my future. Everything I had built suddenly felt hollow. What was the point of creating an empire if there was no one to inherit it?&quot;<br/><br/>She looked toward the window, her profile sharp against the fading light. &quot;Then you came into my life. Not as a replacement for Sophia—no one could ever be that—but as something unexpected. A second chance, perhaps.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille had never heard Victoria speak so openly about her feelings. It frightened her more than the surgery, more than the cancer, more than the will. Victoria Kane did not share her inner thoughts unless she feared she might not have another opportunity.<br/><br/>&quot;When I took you in,&quot; Victoria continued, &quot;it was partly for Sophia. You reminded me of her, your potential, your raw strength that others had tried to crush. I thought helping you would somehow honor her memory.&quot;<br/><br/>She turned back to Camille, her eyes clear and direct. &quot;But somewhere along the way, it became about you. Just you. The woman you were becoming. The woman you are now.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille felt tears threatening and fought them back. Victoria despised emotional displays.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m not ready to take your place,&quot; she admitted.<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s expression softened marginally. &quot;No one ever feels ready for power, Camille. Those who think they are invariably prove themselves unworthy of it.&quot;<br/><br/>She gestured to the bedside table. &quot;Hand me that folder—the blue one.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille passed it to her. Victoria opened it, removing several sheets of paper covered in her distinctive handwriting.<br/><br/>&quot;These are notes I&#x27;ve prepared for you. Things I want you to know, strategies I might not have time to teach you.&quot; She hesitated, uncharacteristically uncertain. &quot;And some personal thoughts as well.&quot;<br/><br/>She held out the papers. Camille took them, careful not to let their hands touch, afraid that physical contact might break the fragile control she was maintaining.<br/><br/>&quot;Read them after I&#x27;m in surgery,&quot; Victoria instructed. &quot;They might help you understand... certain decisions I&#x27;ve made.&quot;<br/><br/>A nurse entered the room, carrying a tray of medication. &quot;Time for your pre-op preparation, Ms. Kane.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria nodded. &quot;Very well.&quot; She looked at Camille. &quot;You should go. Get some rest. Tomorrow will be a long day.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille stood, clutching the folder to her chest. She wanted to say something meaningful, something that captured the complexity of her feelings, but words seemed inadequate.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ll be here when you wake up,&quot; she promised instead.<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s mouth curved slightly. &quot;I expect nothing less.&quot;<br/><br/>At the door, Camille paused and looked back. Victoria was already speaking to the nurse, her manner brisk and businesslike, showing no trace of fear about the procedure that awaited her. The sight struck Camille with a sudden clarity, this was the kind of strength she had been learning all these months. Not just the ability to fight enemies or run a company, but the courage to face whatever came with unflinching resolve.<br/><br/>Outside in the corridor, Camille leaned against the wall, the folder pressed against her heart like a shield. Throughout her transformation from Camille Lewis to Camille Kane, she had focused on becoming powerful enough to destroy her enemies. She had never considered what it might mean to become powerful enough to carry Victoria&#x27;s legacy.<br/><br/>Her phone buzzed. Alexander, texting to check on Victoria.<br/><br/>*Surgery tomorrow morning. She&#x27;s ready. Just updated her will.*<br/><br/>She hesitated, then added: *She named me her sole heir.*<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s response came seconds later: *Of course she did. There was never any doubt.*<br/><br/>Camille stared at his words, wondering how something so monumental to her could seem so obvious to him.<br/><br/>The elevator doors opened, and she stepped inside, still clutching Victoria&#x27;s folder. As the doors closed, she caught a final glimpse of Victoria&#x27;s room down the corridor, the last place she had expected to find herself when she signed those divorce papers eighteen months ago.<br/><br/></div>
