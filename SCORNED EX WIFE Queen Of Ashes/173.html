        <h1>Chapter 115-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 115<br/><br/>Camille followed the doctor down the sterile corridor, each step echoing against the polished floor. Alexander walked beside her, his presence steadying as the world seemed to tilt beneath her feet. The hospital&#x27;s antiseptic smell burned her nostrils, mingling with the lingering scent of coffee on her breath.<br/><br/>&quot;Is she...&quot; Camille couldn&#x27;t finish the question, fear clogging her throat.<br/><br/>The doctor glanced back, his face unreadable beneath his surgical mask. &quot;The chief surgeon will explain everything.&quot;<br/><br/>They turned a corner into a small consultation room where Dr. Lin, Victoria&#x27;s lead surgeon, stood washing her hands. She turned as they entered, pulling down her mask. Exhaustion lined her face, but her eyes held a clarity that made Camille&#x27;s heart leap.<br/><br/>&quot;The surgery was successful,&quot; Dr. Lin said without preamble.<br/><br/>The words hit Camille like a physical force. She reached for the wall to steady herself, her knees suddenly weak. Alexander&#x27;s arm came around her waist, supporting her weight.<br/><br/>&quot;She&#x27;s alive,&quot; Camille whispered, the two words holding the weight of a universe.<br/><br/>Dr. Lin nodded. &quot;We encountered a complication during the procedure, unexpected bleeding that concerned us enough to notify you. But Ms. Kane responded well. We removed the tumor completely and found less spread than the imaging suggested.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille pressed a hand to her mouth, containing a sob of relief. &quot;When can I see her?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;She&#x27;s in recovery now. The anesthesia will take time to wear off.&quot; Dr. Lin checked her watch. &quot;Perhaps another hour. She&#x27;ll be groggy, confused. That&#x27;s normal.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;But she&#x27;ll recover? Fully recover?&quot; Alexander asked, his voice steady where Camille&#x27;s could not be.<br/><br/>&quot;The prognosis is excellent,&quot; Dr. Lin confirmed. &quot;We&#x27;ll need to monitor her closely and begin immunotherapy once she&#x27;s healed from surgery, but yes, I believe Ms. Kane has a very good chance of full recovery.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille closed her eyes, waves of relief washing through her. The tightness in her chest, present since Victoria had collapsed in her office, finally began to ease.<br/><br/>&quot;Thank you,&quot; she managed, opening her eyes to meet the surgeon&#x27;s gaze. &quot;Thank you for saving her.&quot;<br/><br/>Dr. Lin&#x27;s professional demeanor softened slightly. &quot;Ms. Kane is remarkably strong. Her body responded to the surgery better than someone half her age might have. She did most of the work herself.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That sounds like Victoria,&quot; Alexander said with a faint smile.<br/><br/>Dr. Lin excused herself to check on her patient, leaving Camille and Alexander alone in the consultation room. The moment the door closed, Camille&#x27;s composure crumbled. She turned to Alexander, burying her face against his chest as tears came, not tears of fear or grief now, but overwhelming relief.<br/><br/>&quot;She&#x27;s going to live,&quot; she whispered against the fabric of his shirt. &quot;She&#x27;s going to live.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander held her, one hand stroking her hair. &quot;I told you she was too stubborn to give up.&quot;<br/><br/>A laugh bubbled up through Camille&#x27;s tears. &quot;She is the most stubborn person I&#x27;ve ever met.&quot;<br/><br/>They stayed like that for several minutes, Camille allowing herself this moment of vulnerability. When she finally pulled away, wiping her eyes, she felt lighter somehow, as if a weight had shifted inside her.<br/><br/>&quot;I need to call the office,&quot; she said, reaching for her phone. &quot;The board expects an update this morning.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander caught her hand. &quot;What will you tell them?&quot;<br/><br/>Camille hesitated. Victoria had been clear, no one could know about her illness. &quot;That Victoria came through her medical procedure successfully and is resting comfortably. That she&#x27;ll be working remotely during her recovery from... exhaustion.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander nodded. &quot;And Rose and Herod?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;They don&#x27;t get to know anything,&quot; Camille said, her voice hardening. &quot;If they suspect Victoria is weakened, they&#x27;ll accelerate whatever they&#x27;re planning.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;They already are,&quot; Alexander reminded her. &quot;The stock purchases, the whisper campaign, the attempts to access our systems.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Then we&#x27;ll be ready,&quot; Camille said, a new determination filling her. With Victoria alive, with the threat of loss retreating, her mind cleared. &quot;In fact, let them come. I&#x27;m tired of playing defense.&quot;<br/><br/>*** **<br/><br/>An hour later, Camille stood outside Victoria&#x27;s recovery room, her heart hammering against her ribs. Through the small window in the door, she could see Victoria&#x27;s still form, surrounded by machines that beeped and hummed.<br/><br/>&quot;Go on,&quot; Alexander urged gently. &quot;I&#x27;ll wait here.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded, squaring her shoulders before pushing the door open. The room was dimly lit, the blinds drawn against the morning sun. Victoria lay against white sheets, her silver hair spread across the pillow, her skin pale but no longer bearing that gray undertone that had frightened Camille so deeply.<br/><br/>She approached the bed quietly, sinking into the chair positioned beside it. Victoria&#x27;s hand lay atop the blanket, an IV line snaking from her wrist. Camille hesitated, then carefully took that hand in her own.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m here,&quot; she said softly.<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s eyelids fluttered at the sound of her voice. Camille held her breath, watching as Victoria struggled toward consciousness, fighting against the heavy pull of anesthesia.<br/><br/>Finally, her eyes opened—unfocused at first, then gradually sharpening as they found Camille&#x27;s face.</div>
