        <h1>Chapter 169-2</h1>
        <div><br/>&quot;They&#x27;ve found us. I don&#x27;t know how, but they&#x27;re here.&quot; A pause. &quot;No, I&#x27;m moving to Plan B. Get the boat ready.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander motioned for silence, pressing a small device against the door. A tiny screen lit up, showing a thermal image of the room beyond. Two figures, one seated, one pacing.<br/><br/>&quot;Camille&#x27;s still there,&quot; Alexander whispered. &quot;Rose is on the move.&quot;<br/><br/>Through the earpiece came a flurry of urgent reports. Their teams had discovered more than just guards, the entire property had been rigged with motion-activated defenses. Hidden cameras. Pressure plates. Trip wires connected to unknown devices.<br/><br/>&quot;Sir, we&#x27;ve found what looks like explosives wired to the foundation,&quot; reported a team member from the west side. &quot;This entire place is booby-trapped.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan&#x27;s blood ran cold. Rose wasn&#x27;t just hiding, she&#x27;d prepared for war.<br/><br/>&quot;Alexander,&quot; he whispered urgently. &quot;Rose always had escape routes. Always. Margaret said she used to panic if she didn&#x27;t know exactly how to get out of any room.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s eyes narrowed. &quot;Check for hidden exits,&quot; he ordered his team.<br/><br/>Inside the room, they could hear Rose&#x27;s voice growing more agitated. &quot;I don&#x27;t care what it takes. I&#x27;ll be there in two minutes. Have the boat ready.&quot;<br/><br/>A faint beep echoed through the door, followed by a mechanical sound, something sliding or opening.<br/><br/>&quot;Multiple heat signatures moving through the woods toward the lake,&quot; reported the team watching the perimeter. &quot;Looks like reinforcements heading for the boathouse.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander made a quick decision. &quot;Change of plans. We breach now, before she can move Camille.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan&#x27;s heart jumped into his throat as the team readied for entry. Whatever lay beyond that door would determine Camille&#x27;s fate.<br/><br/>&quot;Go!&quot; Alexander ordered.<br/><br/>The door burst open as the team rushed in, weapons raised.<br/><br/>They found themselves in a room filled with computer monitors displaying every angle of the property. In the center sat a chair with cut ropes hanging from its arms, empty.<br/><br/>&quot;Clear!&quot; called one of Alexander&#x27;s men, sweeping the room. &quot;No targets!&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander strode to the chair, touching the restraints. &quot;Still warm. She was just here.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan noticed a hidden panel standing ajar in the back wall. &quot;There! Secret passage!&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander rushed to the opening, peering into a narrow tunnel lit by emergency lights. &quot;They&#x27;ve moved her.&quot;<br/><br/>On the monitors, exterior cameras showed Rose&#x27;s men rushing toward the lake, taking defensive positions around the boathouse.<br/><br/>&quot;They&#x27;re evacuating,&quot; Alexander said grimly. &quot;Rose knows we&#x27;re here.&quot;<br/><br/>A red light began blinking on the main console, accompanied by a steady beeping sound. One of Alexander&#x27;s tech specialists rushed to examine it.<br/><br/>&quot;Sir, she&#x27;s activated some kind of countdown. The system&#x27;s locked.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander grabbed his comm. &quot;All teams, be advised. Possible explosive devices activated. Proceed with extreme caution.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan stared at the empty chair where Camille had been moments before. So close. They&#x27;d been so close.<br/><br/>On one of the monitors, a camera caught a brief glimpse of Rose hurrying across the grounds toward the lake, supporting someone who could only be Camille. The image was blurred by rain, but there was no mistaking the urgency in Rose&#x27;s movements.<br/><br/>&quot;She&#x27;s taking her to the water,&quot; Stefan said. &quot;There&#x27;s a boat.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander was already moving toward the tunnel. &quot;Jason, take half the team and circle around to cut them off. We&#x27;ll pursue through here.&quot; He glanced at Stefan. &quot;You stay with the rear team.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan shook his head. &quot;No. I know this property. I know where she&#x27;s going.&quot;<br/><br/>For a moment, Alexander looked ready to argue, then nodded tersely. &quot;Stay close.&quot;<br/><br/>They entered the narrow passage, moving swiftly through the damp corridor that smelled of earth and mildew. Stefan recognized the construction, old-fashioned, probably dating back to Prohibition.<br/><br/>&quot;Richard once told Camille this place had tunnels,&quot; Stefan explained as they moved. &quot;The original owner was a bootlegger.&quot;<br/><br/>The passage began to slope upward. Ahead, they could see dim light.<br/><br/>&quot;Movement ahead,&quot; whispered one of the team members. &quot;At least two figures.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander signaled for silence as they approached the exit. They could hear voices now, Rose&#x27;s high and strained, another male voice responding curtly.<br/><br/>&quot;Get her in the boat,&quot; Rose was saying. &quot;She&#x27;s coming with us.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We need to move now,&quot; the man replied. &quot;Pierce&#x27;s team is all over the property.&quot;<br/><br/>The beeping from the monitoring room had followed them somehow, growing more urgent. Whatever countdown Rose had activated was nearing its end.<br/><br/>&quot;Thirty seconds till we breach the exit,&quot; Alexander whispered into his comm. &quot;All teams converge on the boathouse.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan felt a strange calm settle over him. After everything he&#x27;d done wrong, after all his failures, he now had one chance to help save Camille. One chance to prove he wasn&#x27;t the selfish coward who had betrayed her.<br/><br/>&quot;Ready?&quot; Alexander asked, his eyes focused and deadly.<br/><br/>Stefan nodded, clutching the wooden fishing lure in his pocket. &quot;Ready.&quot;<br/><br/>Outside, the rain continued to pound the earth as lightning split the sky. Against the flashes, they could see silhouettes moving toward the lake, Rose&#x27;s final escape plan unfolding.<br/><br/>The countdown in the monitoring room reached its climax.<br/><br/>Inside the cabin, the first detonation charges began to blow.<br/></div>
