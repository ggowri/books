        <h1>Chapter 160-2</h1>
        <div><br/>&quot;No,&quot; Victoria agreed. &quot;Which is why we need to be proactive, not reactive.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille turned back, studying Victoria&#x27;s face. &quot;What are you thinking?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m thinking that Rose expects us to hide. To cower. To wait for her to strike.&quot; Victoria straightened, looking more like herself than she had in weeks. &quot;What she doesn&#x27;t expect is for us to move forward with our lives. To rebuild what she destroyed. To grow stronger while she weakens.&quot;<br/><br/>The idea settled over Camille slowly, like a warm blanket on a cold night. Victoria was right. Rose wanted them paralyzed with fear. Wanted them isolated, separated, vulnerable. Every day they spent simply waiting for her next attack was a small victory for Rose.<br/><br/>&quot;The Phoenix Foundation,&quot; Camille said, the words coming unbidden to her lips. &quot;We should restart it. Rebuild it.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria smiled, pride evident in her eyes. &quot;Exactly. Not just the foundation. Everything. Kane Industries initiatives. Your wedding plans with Alexander. Your life, Camille. The one Rose tried to destroy.&quot;<br/><br/>For the first time in weeks, something other than fear fluttered in Camille&#x27;s chest. Something that felt dangerously like hope.<br/><br/>A knock at the door interrupted them. Alexander entered, his face lighting up when he saw Victoria sitting up, looking stronger than she had since the bombing.<br/><br/>&quot;You look better,&quot; he said, moving to Camille&#x27;s side.<br/><br/>&quot;I am better,&quot; Victoria confirmed. &quot;Dr. Sharma just gave us the test results. The treatment is working better than expected.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s arm slipped around Camille&#x27;s waist, offering silent support. &quot;That&#x27;s the best news I&#x27;ve heard in weeks.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We were just discussing next steps,&quot; Victoria said, her business tone returning. &quot;Specifically, how to move forward instead of simply waiting for Rose&#x27;s next attack.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander glanced at Camille, curiosity in his eyes. &quot;And what did you decide?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That we rebuild,&quot; Camille said, the words feeling right as they left her mouth. &quot;Everything. The foundation. Our lives. All of it.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;While maintaining security precautions,&quot; Victoria added pragmatically.<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s expression grew thoughtful. &quot;It&#x27;s risky. Rose is still out there, still dangerous.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Life is risky,&quot; Victoria countered. &quot;Especially for people like us. That never stopped me before, and it won&#x27;t stop me now.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille felt Alexander studying her face, reading her emotions as clearly as if she&#x27;d spoken them aloud. &quot;What do you think?&quot; he asked softly.<br/><br/>&quot;I think,&quot; Camille said slowly, &quot;that Rose wants us afraid. Wants us hiding. Wants us to put our lives on hold while she plots and plans.&quot; She straightened her shoulders, feeling strength returning with each word. &quot;I think it&#x27;s time we stopped giving her what she wants.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander smiled, a slow spreading of warmth across his face. &quot;Then we rebuild. Together.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria watched them, satisfaction evident in her expression. &quot;Good. Now, Camille, find my phone. I need to call the board members and let them know I&#x27;m not dead yet.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille couldn&#x27;t help laughing at Victoria&#x27;s typical directness. She retrieved the phone from the bedside drawer, marveling at how different she felt compared to just an hour ago. The fear wasn&#x27;t gone, Rose was still out there, still threatening everyone she loved. But now that fear shared space with something else. Something brighter and stronger.<br/><br/>Hope. Not just for Victoria&#x27;s recovery, but for all of them. Hope that they could rebuild what Rose had destroyed. Hope that they could live their lives on their own terms, not dictated by Rose&#x27;s hatred.<br/><br/>As Victoria made her calls, asserting her authority despite her hospital bed location, Camille moved to the window again. The sun was breaking through clouds that had hung over the city for days, bathing the hospital grounds in golden light.<br/><br/>&quot;You&#x27;re smiling,&quot; Alexander said, joining her. &quot;I&#x27;ve missed that.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I didn&#x27;t realize how much I needed good news until we got it,&quot; Camille admitted. &quot;It feels like... I don&#x27;t know. Like breathing after being underwater too long.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander nodded, understanding without needing more explanation. &quot;Victoria recovering changes everything, doesn&#x27;t it?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Not everything. Rose is still out there.&quot; Camille leaned slightly against him, drawing strength from his presence. &quot;But yes, it changes the most important thing. It gives us back our future.&quot;<br/><br/>Behind them, Victoria was speaking forcefully into her phone, already planning board meetings and project reviews from her hospital bed. The sound made Camille smile wider. This was the Victoria she knew, unstoppable, indomitable, refusing to be sidelined even by cancer.<br/><br/>&quot;We still need to be careful,&quot; Alexander warned, ever practical. &quot;Rose won&#x27;t give up just because Victoria is recovering.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I know,&quot; Camille agreed. &quot;But now we&#x27;re fighting for something, not just against someone. That makes us stronger, not weaker.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s arm tightened around her waist. &quot;You sound like Victoria.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Good,&quot; Camille said, meaning it completely. &quot;Because Victoria is a survivor. A fighter. And that&#x27;s exactly what I need to be right now.&quot;<br/><br/>As they stood watching the sunlight spread across the hospital grounds, Camille felt something she hadn&#x27;t experienced in weeks: certainty. Not about Rose&#x27;s capture or what dangers still lay ahead, but about her own ability to face them. To survive them. To triumph over them.<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s surprising resilience had given Camille more than hope for her mother&#x27;s recovery. It had reminded her of who she was. Who she had become under Victoria&#x27;s guidance. Who she could still be, despite everything Rose had tried to take from her.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;re going to be okay,&quot; she whispered, half to Alexander, half to herself. &quot;All of us.&quot;<br/><br/>And for the first time since Rose&#x27;s threatening message, Camille truly believed it.<br/></div>
