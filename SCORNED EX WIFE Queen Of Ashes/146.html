        <h1>Chapter 100-2</h1>
        <div><br/>Victoria&#x27;s eyes widened slightly. &quot;You think she&#x27;ll go after Alexander? Or me?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Eventually. Yes.&quot; Camille&#x27;s throat tightened. &quot;Rose has always wanted what I have. She took Stefan. She tried to take my family, my reputation, my status. Now she&#x27;ll want to take...&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander crossed the room in three quick strides, taking her face in his hands. &quot;Let her try.&quot;<br/><br/>His touch anchored her, pushing back the wave of fear threatening to drown her. In his eyes, she saw not just affection but fierce determination.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m not Stefan,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;I won&#x27;t be manipulated. I won&#x27;t be turned. And I&#x27;m a lot harder to get rid of than she thinks.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria watched them, then opened her desk drawer and removed something small and silver. She held it out to Camille, a pin in the shape of a knight chess piece.<br/><br/>&quot;I was going to give you this after the Grid went online,&quot; Victoria said. &quot;The knight, the piece that moves differently than all the others. The piece that can leap over obstacles. The piece that&#x27;s most dangerous when it&#x27;s underestimated.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille took the pin, feeling its weight in her palm.<br/><br/>&quot;Now I think you need it sooner,&quot; Victoria continued. &quot;To remind you that sometimes the best move isn&#x27;t the obvious one.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Thank you,&quot; Camille said, pinning it beside her phoenix emblem.<br/><br/>Victoria straightened. &quot;We&#x27;ll need to move quickly. I want twenty-four-hour security on all of us. Full background checks on everyone working on the Grid project.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Done,&quot; Alexander said.<br/><br/>&quot;And Rose?&quot; Camille asked.<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s mouth tightened. &quot;We need to draw her out. Force her to show her hand.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;How?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;By giving her something she can&#x27;t resist.&quot; Victoria rubbed her temples. &quot;What does Rose want more than anything?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;To destroy me,&quot; Camille said. &quot;To take everything I have.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Exactly. And right now, what&#x27;s most important to you?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The Phoenix Grid.&quot; Camille understood immediately. &quot;We make her think we&#x27;ve discovered a flaw in the system. Something that could delay the launch.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander nodded. &quot;A carefully leaked internal memo suggesting security concerns. Technical problems that need addressing.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Rose will think her sabotage was discovered,&quot; Camille continued, &quot;but not completely understood. She&#x27;ll want to know exactly what we found, and what we missed.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And Herod will want to adjust his timeline,&quot; Victoria added. &quot;They&#x27;ll need to communicate, to coordinate.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Which gives us a chance to track them,&quot; Alexander finished.<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s expression remained troubled. &quot;What about your relationship? The press is already speculating after the groundbreaking ceremony.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria studied them both. &quot;You&#x27;re not ready to go public.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No. Not yet. Not like this.&quot; Camille exchanged a glance with Alexander. &quot;What we have is too new, too personal to use as a strategic move.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We don&#x27;t want Rose targeting it specifically,&quot; Alexander added. &quot;Better to keep it private, protected.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria nodded. &quot;I understand. Some weapons are best kept sheathed until the perfect moment. We&#x27;ll find another way to draw them out.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille felt relief wash through her. What was growing between her and Alexander felt precious, fragile despite its strength.<br/><br/>&quot;Thank you,&quot; she said softly.<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s gaze sharpened. &quot;Don&#x27;t thank me yet. This fight is just beginning, and it will get much worse before it ends. Herod Preston spent a decade rebuilding from nothing. That kind of patience, that level of determination...&quot; She shook her head. &quot;He won&#x27;t be easily defeated.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Neither will we,&quot; Camille said firmly.<br/><br/>Victoria smiled then, a real smile that transformed her face. &quot;No. We won&#x27;t.&quot;<br/><br/>She turned to Alexander. &quot;Have your team leak that internal memo first thing tomorrow. Make it seem accidental, an email sent to the wrong distribution list, perhaps.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Consider it done.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria moved toward the door. &quot;Now, if you&#x27;ll excuse me, I need to make some calls.&quot;<br/><br/>At the doorway, she paused, looking back at Camille. &quot;Camille... thank you. For saying you won&#x27;t let me fight alone. It&#x27;s been a very long time since anyone stood with me.&quot;<br/><br/>Before Camille could respond, Victoria was gone.<br/><br/>Alexander took Camille&#x27;s hand. &quot;Are you alright?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No,&quot; she admitted. &quot;I&#x27;m scared. Not for myself, but for her. For you.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Hey,&quot; Alexander said gently, pulling her closer. &quot;Remember what you told Victoria? Together. We fight together.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Besides,&quot; he added, a hint of steel entering his voice, &quot;Rose may think she knows you. But she has no idea who I am. What I&#x27;m capable of.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille caught a glimpse of something hard and dangerous beneath his usual controlled exterior.<br/><br/>&quot;You&#x27;ve been fighting for me from the shadows all this time,&quot; she said softly. &quot;Now we fight side by side.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Side by side,&quot; he agreed. &quot;No more operating separately. No more secrets between us.&quot;<br/><br/>His phone buzzed. He frowned at the screen. &quot;My team found something. Herod has been moving large sums to offshore accounts. Recently.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What does it mean?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It means he&#x27;s preparing for something big.&quot; Alexander&#x27;s eyes met hers. &quot;Camille, whatever&#x27;s coming... it&#x27;s coming soon.&quot;<br/><br/>She touched the knight pin at her lapel. &quot;Then we&#x27;ll be ready.&quot;<br/><br/>But even as she spoke the words, a whisper of doubt curled through her mind. Rose had always been one step ahead. And now, with Herod Preston beside her, with resources and hatred fueling them both...<br/></div>
