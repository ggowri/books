        <h1>Chapter 101-2</h1>
        <div><br/>&quot;They&#x27;ll know we&#x27;re onto them,&quot; Alexander finished. &quot;But we also can&#x27;t let these modified blueprints remain in the system.&quot;<br/><br/>Hannah looked between them. &quot;I can create a new set of blueprints with the correct specifications. Upload them as an &#x27;updated version&#x27; rather than flagging the current ones.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Would that work?&quot; Camille asked.<br/><br/>Hannah nodded. &quot;It&#x27;s standard procedure to issue revisions. No one would question it.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Do it,&quot; Camille said. &quot;But keep the modified versions for evidence.&quot;<br/><br/>While Hannah worked, Alexander pulled Camille aside. &quot;We need to watch Walsh without alerting him. If he&#x27;s their inside man, he could lead us to Rose and Herod.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I agree. But we also need to check every other system. If they compromised the blueprints, what else might they have accessed?&quot;<br/><br/>For the next hour, they reviewed security protocols, testing procedures, and implementation schedules. The sabotage was comprehensive, clearly the work of someone with both technical knowledge and access to Kane Industries&#x27; most secure systems.<br/><br/>By three in the morning, Hannah had uploaded corrected blueprints. Alexander had arranged surveillance on James Walsh using his own resources to avoid potential leaks.<br/><br/>Camille stared at the glass wall covered in Hannah&#x27;s markings, each representing a potential disaster averted. Rose hadn&#x27;t just tried to destroy the Grid, she&#x27;d tried to destroy Camille&#x27;s reputation, her future, possibly her freedom if the failures had been blamed on negligence.<br/><br/>&quot;We should get some rest,&quot; Alexander said softly. &quot;Hannah&#x27;s nearly asleep at her keyboard.&quot;<br/><br/>After Hannah left, Camille collapsed onto her office sofa. The weight of everything, Victoria&#x27;s revelations about Herod, the blueprint sabotage, the knowledge that someone inside Kane Industries had betrayed them, crushed down on her.<br/><br/>Alexander sat beside her, taking her hand. &quot;We caught it in time. The Grid is safe now.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This time,&quot; Camille said. &quot;But Rose and Herod won&#x27;t stop. They&#x27;ll try something else.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Next time we&#x27;ll be ready,&quot; Alexander assured her. &quot;They think their sabotage is still in place. That gives us an advantage.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille wanted to believe him. But the nagging feeling that they were missing something crucial wouldn&#x27;t leave her.<br/><br/>&quot;What if the blueprints are just one part of their plan?&quot; she asked. &quot;What if there&#x27;s something else we haven&#x27;t found yet?&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander squeezed her hand. &quot;Then we&#x27;ll find it. Together.&quot;<br/><br/>As Camille gathered the scattered blueprints, a thought struck her. &quot;These modifications are incredibly technical. But they also required intimate knowledge of our security systems. That suggests two people, a technical expert and someone with inside knowledge of Kane Industries.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Walsh could be the technical expert,&quot; Alexander suggested. &quot;But who&#x27;s the insider?&quot;<br/><br/>Camille stilled. &quot;Someone high enough to access secure systems. Someone who&#x27;s been here long enough to know all our protocols.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You&#x27;re thinking of a specific person.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded slowly. &quot;Damon Greene. Head of Special Projects. He worked with Victoria for fifteen years. He has access to everything, including biometric systems.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Why would he help Rose?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I don&#x27;t know. But he always seemed to resent Victoria bringing me in. And he was traveling last month when the first modifications appeared. Supposedly at our Tokyo office, but...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ll have him checked out,&quot; Alexander promised. &quot;Discreetly.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded, though unease still prickled along her skin. &quot;What if Rose and Herod have allies throughout Kane Industries?&quot;<br/><br/>He rose, crossing to her. &quot;Then we trust no one except each other and Victoria.&quot;<br/><br/>His face was set in determination, but his eyes held a softness reserved only for her.<br/><br/>&quot;I won&#x27;t let them hurt you,&quot; he said quietly.<br/><br/>Camille leaned forward, resting her forehead against his chest. She felt his arms encircle her, solid and secure.<br/><br/>&quot;Promise me something,&quot; she whispered.<br/><br/>&quot;Anything.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Promise me we won&#x27;t become them. That in fighting Rose and Herod, we won&#x27;t lose ourselves to hatred. To revenge.&quot;<br/><br/>His arms tightened around her. &quot;I promise.&quot;<br/><br/>Outside, the first pale light of dawn touched the horizon. A new day beginning, bringing new dangers. But for the first time since learning about Herod Preston, Camille felt something besides fear and determination.<br/><br/>She felt hope. Small and fragile, but present nonetheless.<br/><br/>Together, they had uncovered the sabotage in time. Together, they would face whatever came next.<br/><br/>But as Camille gathered the last of the blueprints, doubt echoed in her mind. They had found these modifications, but what if there were others, hidden deeper? What if this discovery was exactly what Rose and Herod wanted, to give them false confidence?<br/><br/>She glanced at Alexander, now arranging surveillance on Brown and Greene. She wouldn&#x27;t share her doubts yet. Not until she had something concrete.<br/><br/>For now, they would proceed according to plan. Correct the sabotage. Track the traitors. Draw Rose and Herod into the open.<br/><br/>But Camille couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that the real danger still lurked unseen, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.<br/></div>
