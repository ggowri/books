        <h1>Chapter 133-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 133<br/><br/>Rose hurled the empty bottle against the wall. It shattered into tiny pieces, much like their plans. On the television, news channels couldn&#x27;t stop talking about the Phoenix Grid&#x27;s successful launch. Camille&#x27;s face appeared on every station, her triumph complete.<br/><br/>&quot;Turn it off!&quot; she screamed, her voice raw from hours of rage.<br/><br/>Herod stood by the window of their shabby motel room, his back to her. They had been forced to hide here after abandoning his penthouse. His finger pressed the remote button, silencing Camille&#x27;s voice mid-sentence about &quot;transformation&quot; and &quot;rising from the ashes.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;All of it,&quot; Herod said, his voice hollow with defeat. &quot;All my planning, all my resources, all the time spent cultivating Walsh as our inside man, wasted.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We knew they discovered Walsh,&quot; Rose paced the worn carpet, her movements sharp and erratic. &quot;But how did they block the signal jammer too? That was supposed to be foolproof!&quot;<br/><br/>Herod turned to face her. His expensive suit looked out of place against the peeling wallpaper. The room smelled of old cigarettes and cheap cleaning products.<br/><br/>&quot;Their systems had protections I&#x27;ve never seen before,&quot; he said, frustration evident in the tightness of his jaw. &quot;Everything I&#x27;ve built since approaching you with this plan, gone in an instant.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose twisted the cap off a new bottle with such force it cut into her palm. She didn&#x27;t seem to notice the small line of blood.<br/><br/>&quot;She&#x27;s always one step ahead now,&quot; she muttered, taking a long drink. &quot;My sister. The great Camille Kane. Phoenix rising from the ashes.&quot;<br/><br/>Her mocking tone couldn&#x27;t hide the raw jealousy beneath. She turned to the mirror, barely recognizing herself. Her carefully maintained appearance had crumbled over the past days. Dark roots showed in her hair. Her eyes looked wild, rimmed with smeared makeup.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;re finished,&quot; Herod said quietly. &quot;Kane Industries stock is soaring. The Grid is operational. Every plan we had has failed.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose spun toward him, bottle clutched in her white-knuckled hand. &quot;Finished? FINISHED? We haven&#x27;t even started!&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Rose...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No!&quot; She moved closer, her face inches from his. &quot;We didn&#x27;t fail because of Walsh or better security. We failed because we weren&#x27;t willing to go far enough.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod studied her, seeing something dangerous in her eyes. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I mean we&#x27;ve been playing by their rules.&quot; Rose&#x27;s voice dropped to an intense whisper. &quot;Trying to sabotage their precious Grid through codes and software. Trying to damage their reputation. It&#x27;s too subtle.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;There&#x27;s nothing subtle about what we&#x27;ve tried,&quot; Herod argued.<br/><br/>&quot;Yes, there is.&quot; Rose&#x27;s smile chilled him. &quot;We never targeted the actual infrastructure. The physical Grid itself.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod stepped back. &quot;You&#x27;re talking about destroying Grid components directly.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; Rose&#x27;s eyes lit up. &quot;The main control hub. The primary junction boxes. The central servers. Not through codes, but through direct action.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s not sabotage anymore, Rose. That&#x27;s terrorism.&quot;<br/><br/>She laughed, the sound brittle and sharp. &quot;Such a dramatic word. I prefer to call it direct action.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod moved to the small table where his laptop sat. He closed it deliberately. &quot;When I first approached you about working together, I wanted to acquire Kane Industries, to make Victoria pay for destroying my family&#x27;s company. But this...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This is exactly what we&#x27;ve been working toward all along!&quot; Rose slammed her bottle on the table, liquid sloshing over the sides. &quot;Don&#x27;t pretend you&#x27;re shocked now. Don&#x27;t act like you haven&#x27;t thought about it too.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;There&#x27;s a difference between thinking and doing,&quot; Herod said quietly.<br/><br/>&quot;Is there?&quot; Rose&#x27;s voice softened dangerously. &quot;When Victoria destroyed your family&#x27;s company, when your brother killed himself, didn&#x27;t you imagine making her suffer? Physically suffer?&quot;<br/><br/>Herod turned away, unable to deny it. In his darkest moments after his brother&#x27;s suicide, he had imagined Victoria Kane suffering, dying even. But fantasy was different from reality.<br/><br/>&quot;The Grid is operational now,&quot; he said instead. &quot;Security will be even tighter.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;But they think they&#x27;ve won.&quot; Rose moved closer again, her body pressing against his back, her voice a caress against his ear. &quot;They think we&#x27;ve been neutralized. They won&#x27;t expect a physical attack now.&quot;<br/><br/>Her hands slid around his waist. &quot;Think about it, Herod. The Phoenix Grid&#x27;s grand launch, celebrated worldwide. And then, just days later, its spectacular failure. Camille&#x27;s moment of triumph turned to public humiliation.&quot;<br/><br/>Her words painted a picture he couldn&#x27;t help but find appealing. Victoria&#x27;s pride crushed. Camille&#x27;s reputation destroyed. His brother finally avenged.<br/><br/>&quot;How would we even do it?&quot; he asked, already hating himself for considering it.<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s smile widened. She moved to her bag, pulling out papers. Diagrams of Grid infrastructure. Security rotations. Access points.<br/><br/>&quot;You&#x27;ve been planning this all along,&quot; Herod realized.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ve been considering all options,&quot; Rose corrected, spreading the papers on the bed. &quot;The main control hub has the weakest physical security. Attack there, and the entire Grid fails.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;People could be hurt,&quot; Herod pointed out.<br/><br/>Rose didn&#x27;t even blink. &quot;Casualties are inevitable in war.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This isn&#x27;t war.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Isn&#x27;t it?&quot; Her eyes flashed. &quot;You came to me because Victoria Kane destroyed your family. I joined you because Camille stole my life. They declared war first.&quot;<br/><br/>She pressed against him again, her body warm and familiar. &quot;We&#x27;ve tried it your way, Herod. The careful, calculated approach. And we&#x27;ve failed every time.&quot;<br/><br/>Her lips brushed his ear. &quot;Now we try it my way.&quot;</div>
