        <h1>Chapter 125</h1>
        <div><p>Chapter 125<br/><br/>Hannah Zhao stared at her computer screen, the blue light reflecting off her glasses as she analyzed access logs to the Phoenix Grid&#x27;s secure database.<br/><br/>&quot;I found it,&quot; she said as Camille approached with coffee. &quot;The leak in our team.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille set down the cups, suddenly alert. &quot;Show me.&quot;<br/><br/>Hannah displayed a series of highlighted entries. &quot;Someone&#x27;s been accessing our secure servers between 2:00 and 3:00 AM three times weekly. Always the same nights, always looking at Grid specifications, safety protocols, activation sequences.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Do you know who?&quot; Camille asked, leaning closer.<br/><br/>Hannah nodded grimly. &quot;I installed a silent tracker last week.&quot; She opened another window showing screenshots. &quot;It&#x27;s Walsh.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The maintenance technician who installed the modified circuits?&quot; Camille&#x27;s eyes narrowed.<br/><br/>&quot;The same. We were watching his physical access, but overlooked his digital footprint.&quot; Hannah pulled up financial records. &quot;He&#x27;s still receiving payments from an offshore account.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Rose,&quot; Camille said, the name like a curse.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ve prepared termination paperwork,&quot; Hannah continued. &quot;Security can escort him out today.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille didn&#x27;t respond immediately, her expression shifting from anger to calculation.<br/><br/>&quot;Don&#x27;t fire him,&quot; she said finally.<br/><br/>&quot;What?&quot; Hannah looked up, startled. &quot;But he&#x27;s leaking critical information!&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Exactly. And now that we know, we can control what information he leaks.&quot; Camille straightened. &quot;We&#x27;ve been on the defensive with Rose and Herod for too long. It&#x27;s time we took control.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You want to feed him false information?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Not just false, misleading. Information that serves our purposes.&quot; Camille pulled up a chair. &quot;What if Walsh received access to files suggesting vulnerability in the Grid&#x27;s west junction? Nothing that would actually endanger the system, but enough to make Rose and Herod think they&#x27;ve found a weakness.&quot;<br/><br/>Understanding dawned in Hannah&#x27;s eyes. &quot;We create a trap, and they walk right into it.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Better yet, when they act on this information, we&#x27;ll know exactly where they&#x27;ll be and what they&#x27;ll be targeting.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We can track them,&quot; Hannah said, fingers already moving across her keyboard. &quot;I can create dummy files with embedded trackers. When they&#x27;re opened on another system, we&#x27;ll know the location.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;How soon can you set it up?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;By tonight,&quot; Hannah promised. &quot;I&#x27;ll create a special portal that looks identical to our regular system but contains only the files we want Walsh to find.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Don&#x27;t tell anyone else yet. Not even Alexander,&quot; Camille instructed. &quot;We need to brief Victoria first.&quot;<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Victoria listened silently as Camille and Hannah explained their discovery and proposed response, her fingers steepled beneath her chin.<br/><br/>&quot;Instead of eliminating the threat,&quot; Victoria said finally, &quot;you want to manipulate it. Use their own weapon against them.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes,&quot; Camille confirmed. &quot;Walsh is more valuable to us as an unwitting double agent than as a fired employee.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s lips curved slightly. &quot;And the risk? If he discovers your trap, or if the information he passes causes unexpected problems?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;ll control every bit of data he sees,&quot; Hannah explained. &quot;The files will appear genuine to anyone who doesn&#x27;t know our actual systems intimately.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria rose, moving to the window where the Phoenix Grid control center was visible in the distance.<br/><br/>&quot;There&#x27;s elegance in your approach,&quot; she said. &quot;It reminds me of a strategy I used early in my career. A competitor had placed someone in my company—much like Rose has done with Walsh. Everyone advised me to fire him immediately.&quot;<br/><br/>She turned to face them. &quot;Instead, I kept him close. Fed him exactly what I wanted my competitor to know. When they moved against me based on that information, they found themselves outmaneuvered at every turn.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille felt a rush of pride at the comparison.<br/><br/>Victoria studied her for a long moment. &quot;You&#x27;re not just reacting anymore. You&#x27;re anticipating, planning three moves ahead. Good.&quot;<br/><br/>Hannah displayed her preliminary design for the false portal. &quot;Everything Walsh accesses will be logged and tracked. Any files he copies will contain hidden markers that will activate when opened on another device.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;When will you deploy this?&quot; Victoria asked.<br/><br/>&quot;Tonight,&quot; Hannah replied. &quot;Walsh always accesses the system between 2:00 and 3:00 AM on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays.&quot;<br/><br/>For the next hour, the three women constructed an elaborate deception. They identified a junction box in the Grid&#x27;s western sector that would appear vulnerable based on the false data, though it was actually one of the most secure points in the system.<br/><br/>&quot;Any attempt to exploit this &#x27;vulnerability&#x27; would be immediately contained and would identify exactly who was behind it,&quot; Camille explained.<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s eyes gleamed with appreciation. &quot;This isn&#x27;t just about defending anymore. This is about setting a trap, forcing them to expose themselves.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;They&#x27;ve been dictating the terms of this battle from the beginning,&quot; Camille said. &quot;This is our chance to reverse the dynamic.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria approved the plan. As Hannah left to implement it, Victoria gestured for Camille to remain.<br/><br/>&quot;You&#x27;re changing,&quot; Victoria observed. &quot;The woman I found eighteen months ago would never have conceived of such a strategy. She would have reacted with immediate retribution.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded. &quot;That woman was defined by her wounds, her need for direct revenge.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And now?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Now I understand that true power isn&#x27;t about immediate satisfaction. It&#x27;s about patience, strategy, control.&quot; Camille met Victoria&#x27;s gaze. &quot;You taught me that.&quot;<br/><br/>Something shifted in Victoria&#x27;s expression—pride, perhaps. &quot;When I found you in that parking garage, I saw potential. Raw strength that others had tried to break. But even I didn&#x27;t anticipate how completely you would transform.&quot;<br/><br/>The rare personal acknowledgment caught Camille off guard.<br/><br/>&quot;You gave me the tools,&quot; she said simply.<br/><br/>Victoria shook her head slightly. &quot;Tools are useless without the right person wielding them. What you&#x27;ve become, that&#x27;s your own creation.&quot;<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>That night, Camille and Hannah watched as Walsh logged into their system remotely at 2:00 AM. He navigated through files, spending nearly twenty minutes examining the fabricated vulnerability reports.<br/><br/>&quot;He&#x27;s copying them,&quot; Hannah noted. &quot;The trackers are embedded. When those files are opened, we&#x27;ll know exactly where.&quot;<br/><br/>At 2:47 AM, Walsh logged out, having downloaded precisely the information they wanted Rose and Herod to have.<br/><br/>&quot;Now we wait,&quot; Camille said. &quot;Let&#x27;s see what Rose does with her new &#x27;intelligence.&#x27;&quot;<br/><br/>Hannah smiled. &quot;It&#x27;s like watching a mouse approach the cheese, not realizing the trap is about to spring.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No,&quot; Camille corrected, &quot;it&#x27;s like watching a snake slither toward what it thinks is a wounded bird, not realizing the bird is actually a predator in disguise.&quot;<br/><br/>She moved to the window, gazing at the city lights. Somewhere out there, Rose was waiting for information, believing herself clever, believing herself in control.<br/><br/>&quot;For weeks, Rose has been attacking us, forcing us to defend,&quot; Camille said. &quot;That changes tonight.&quot;<br/><br/>The tracker program hummed quietly, ready to alert them the moment their false information reached its intended recipient. Within days, they would have a direct line to Rose&#x27;s location, her plans, her next move.<br/></p><p></p></div>
