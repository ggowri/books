        <h1>Chapter 146-2</h1>
        <div><br/>&quot;Without evidence, it&#x27;s your word against hers,&quot; Chen pointed out. &quot;And you have a strong motive to shift blame.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod felt a wave of despair. Of course they didn&#x27;t believe him. Why would they? Rose had done her job too well, making sure all trails led back to him and him alone.<br/><br/>But then he remembered something. A small detail that might change everything.<br/><br/>&quot;The hotel,&quot; he said suddenly. &quot;The Plaza Hotel.&quot;<br/><br/>Morgan raised an eyebrow. &quot;What about it?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Rose established her alibis there during both bombings. Made sure she was visible, surrounded by witnesses.&quot; Herod&#x27;s words came faster now, urgent. &quot;But she had to leave at some point. There would be a gap in the security footage. A period when she slipped out, planted the bombs, and returned.&quot;<br/><br/>Agent Chen was writing rapidly now. &quot;We can check the hotel&#x27;s security cameras.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Not just the main entrances,&quot; Herod added. &quot;Service doors. Fire exits. Rose is smart, she would find a way out that wouldn&#x27;t be obvious.&quot;<br/><br/>For the first time, Morgan looked genuinely interested. &quot;Anything else?&quot;<br/><br/>Herod thought carefully. What other evidence might Rose have missed? What other trail might she have left?<br/><br/>&quot;Her phone,&quot; he said. &quot;She used a burner for most communications, but sometimes she used her regular phone. Check the tower data on the nights of the bombings. It might show her location.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;ll look into it,&quot; Morgan said, noncommittal.<br/><br/>Herod sensed their continued skepticism. He needed something more concrete, something they couldn&#x27;t ignore.<br/><br/>&quot;The storage unit,&quot; he said suddenly, the memory surfacing through the fog of pain medication.<br/><br/>&quot;What storage unit?&quot; Chen asked.<br/><br/>&quot;In Queens. Under the name Sarah Miller. Unit 217 at Secure Storage on Vernon Boulevard.&quot; The details came back to him in a rush. &quot;Rose kept supplies there. Equipment. Maybe plans. She thought I didn&#x27;t know about it, but I followed her once, saw her using a key with the number on it.&quot;<br/><br/>Now Morgan was taking notes too. &quot;You&#x27;re sure about this? Unit 217, Secure Storage, Vernon Boulevard?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; Herod felt a glimmer of hope. &quot;And there&#x27;s more. Check her connection to Anton Bessonov. Russian businessman with ties to organized crime. She bought the explosives through him.&quot;<br/><br/>The agents looked at each other, a silent communication passing between them. Then Morgan turned back to Herod.<br/><br/>&quot;Mr. Preston, if what you&#x27;re telling us proves true, would you be willing to testify against Rose Lewis in court?&quot;<br/><br/>The question hung in the air. Testify against Rose. The woman he had thought he loved. The woman who had used him, betrayed him, and tried to kill him.<br/><br/>&quot;Yes,&quot; Herod said, his voice stronger now. &quot;I&#x27;ll testify.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Even knowing that would mean admitting your own role?&quot; Chen pressed. &quot;You&#x27;d still face significant jail time for conspiracy.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod thought of his brother Charles. Of what he would want Herod to do. The right thing, no matter the cost.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ll accept whatever punishment I deserve,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;But Rose needs to be stopped before she hurts anyone else.&quot;<br/><br/>Morgan nodded slowly, seeming to reassess the man lying before him. &quot;We&#x27;ll need a complete statement. Every detail you can remember about the bombings, about Rose&#x27;s involvement, about your own actions.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ll tell you everything,&quot; Herod promised. &quot;But there&#x27;s something else you need to know. Something urgent.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What&#x27;s that?&quot; Chen asked.<br/><br/>&quot;Rose won&#x27;t stop,&quot; Herod said, fear creeping into his voice for the first time. &quot;The bombings were just the beginning. She wants to destroy Camille Kane completely. She&#x27;ll try again. Something bigger. More dangerous.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Do you know what she&#x27;s planning?&quot; Morgan leaned forward, suddenly alert.<br/><br/>Herod shook his head, pain shooting through his chest at the movement. &quot;No specific plans. But I know how she thinks. She&#x27;ll go after whatever matters most to Camille.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The charity gala,&quot; Chen said, realization dawning on her face. &quot;It&#x27;s in two days. Every news outlet has covered it.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That would be her style,&quot; Herod agreed weakly, exhaustion starting to overtake him. &quot;Maximum impact. Public humiliation. Complete destruction.&quot;<br/><br/>Morgan stood, already pulling out his phone. &quot;I&#x27;ll contact Kane Industries security. Have them increase protection for the event.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It won&#x27;t be enough,&quot; Herod warned, his voice fading as fatigue washed over him. &quot;You don&#x27;t understand how far Rose will go. What she&#x27;s capable of.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;ll handle it, Mr. Preston,&quot; Chen assured him, but the worry in her eyes betrayed her confidence.<br/><br/>Herod wanted to say more, to make them understand the true nature of the threat Rose posed. But his body had reached its limit. The pain medication pulled him toward unconsciousness, the room growing dim around the edges.<br/><br/>&quot;Check the storage unit,&quot; he managed to say. &quot;Stop her before...&quot; His voice trailed off as darkness claimed him once more.<br/><br/>The last thing he heard was Agent Morgan&#x27;s voice, sharp and urgent, ordering a team to Queens. To the storage unit where proof of Rose&#x27;s crimes might finally be found.<br/><br/>As Herod drifted into unconsciousness, a strange peace settled over him. He had done it. Finally. Told the truth. Chosen the right path, even knowing it would lead to his own punishment.<br/><br/>For the first time since his family&#x27;s downfall, Herod Preston felt something like redemption.<br/><br/>Whether it would be enough to stop Rose remained to be seen.<br/></div>
