        <h1>Chapter 147-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 147<br/><br/>Alexander Pierce stood in the ballroom of the Grand Plaza Hotel, watching his security team transform the elegant space into a fortress. Men in black suits installed hidden cameras in crystal chandeliers. Others tested metal detectors disguised as decorative archways. Every entrance, every window, every air vent was being secured.<br/><br/>&quot;The sniper teams will be positioned here, here, and here,&quot; his head of security explained, pointing to locations on the blueprint spread across a table. &quot;Full view of all approaches. No one gets within a hundred yards without being spotted.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander nodded, but his mind was elsewhere. Rose Lewis had vanished completely. No sightings. No trails. It was as if she had disappeared into thin air. And that worried him more than if she&#x27;d been openly threatening them.<br/><br/>The silent threats were always the deadliest.<br/><br/>His phone buzzed. Stefan Rodriguez&#x27;s name flashed on the screen. Alexander stepped away from the security team to take the call.<br/><br/>&quot;What do you have for me?&quot; he asked without preamble.<br/><br/>&quot;My contact at Bessonov&#x27;s club just called,&quot; Stefan&#x27;s voice was tense, urgent. &quot;Rose met with Anton yesterday. Paid him a large amount of cash.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s grip tightened on the phone. &quot;For what?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;He wouldn&#x27;t say exactly. But it wasn&#x27;t just muscle. She asked for something special. Something with &#x27;impact.&#x27;&quot;<br/><br/>A cold knot formed in Alexander&#x27;s stomach. &quot;Explosives?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Maybe. Or worse.&quot; Stefan paused. &quot;You need to check everything that comes into that ballroom. Food deliveries. Flower arrangements. Staff uniforms. Everything.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We already are.&quot; Alexander looked across the ballroom, where security personnel were using dogs to sniff every package, every decoration. &quot;What else can you tell me about her tactics? How she thinks?&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan was silent for a moment. &quot;Rose likes to strike where it hurts most. She won&#x27;t just go after the building or random guests. She&#x27;ll target what matters to Camille personally.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The Phoenix Foundation donations.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes. Or the people Camille cares about. You. Victoria. Maybe even her parents if they&#x27;re attending.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s jaw tightened. &quot;They are.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Then watch them closely. Rose knows hurting them would destroy Camille in a way that physical harm to Camille herself never could.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander made a mental note to assign additional security to the Lewis family and Victoria. &quot;Anything else?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; Stefan&#x27;s voice dropped lower. &quot;Rose won&#x27;t come herself. Not directly. She&#x27;ll use someone else. Someone no one would suspect.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Like who?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Someone desperate for money. Someone who needs a job. A waiter. A valet. A last-minute replacement for a sick staff member.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander turned toward the hotel manager, who was reviewing staff assignments nearby. &quot;We&#x27;ll check every employee. Run background checks on everyone who enters the building.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It might not be enough,&quot; Stefan warned. &quot;Rose is... creative. She thinks steps ahead.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;So do I,&quot; Alexander said firmly. &quot;Keep working your contacts. If you hear anything else, call me immediately.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I will.&quot;<br/><br/>After ending the call, Alexander summoned his team leaders. In rapid succession, he ordered additional security measures: background checks on all hotel staff extended to family members and associates; bomb-sniffing dogs to check every guest as they arrived; facial recognition software programmed with Rose&#x27;s features to scan the crowd continuously.<br/><br/>&quot;Sir,&quot; one of his team leaders said hesitantly, &quot;some of these measures are quite... intrusive. The guests may object.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I don&#x27;t care,&quot; Alexander said flatly. &quot;Better uncomfortable guests than dead ones.&quot;<br/><br/>The man nodded and returned to his duties. Alexander checked his watch. Four hours until Camille would arrive to inspect the arrangements. Four hours to make this place impenetrable.<br/><br/>His phone rang again. Camille.<br/><br/>&quot;How&#x27;s it going?&quot; she asked, her voice calm but with an undercurrent of tension.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;re turning the Grand Plaza into Fort Knox,&quot; Alexander assured her. &quot;No one gets in without being thoroughly checked.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Stefan called,&quot; Camille said. &quot;He told me about Rose meeting with Bessonov.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m handling it.&quot;<br/><br/>A pause. &quot;I had another nightmare last night.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander stopped pacing. Camille rarely mentioned her nightmares, though he knew she still had them sometimes. &quot;About the gala?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; Her voice was quieter now. &quot;Everyone was there. Smiling. Celebrating. Then everything went dark. When the lights came back on, people were screaming. There was blood on my dress.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It was just a dream,&quot; Alexander said gently, though his own unease deepened. &quot;The security we have in place...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I know.&quot; Camille cut him off. &quot;I know it&#x27;s just anxiety. But I can&#x27;t shake this feeling, Alexander. Like we&#x27;re missing something obvious.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander looked around the ballroom, at the dozens of highly trained security personnel, at the state-of-the-art equipment being installed. What could they possibly be missing?<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ll go over everything again,&quot; he promised. &quot;Triple-check every detail.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Thank you.&quot; She paused. &quot;I love you, you know.&quot;<br/><br/>The simple statement caught him off guard. &quot;I love you too. Are you okay?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes. Just... be careful. I&#x27;ll see you soon.&quot;<br/><br/>After they hung up, Alexander stood motionless for a moment, Camille&#x27;s words echoing in his mind. The fear in her voice had been subtle but unmistakable. Not fear for herself, but for him. For everyone she loved.<br/><br/>With renewed determination, Alexander turned to the hotel&#x27;s head of security. &quot;I want to see the complete staff list. Everyone who will be in this building tonight. From the head chef to the parking attendants.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes, sir. Right away.&quot;<br/><br/>As the man hurried off, Alexander&#x27;s phone buzzed with a text from Stefan: &quot;Rose always has a backup plan. Always.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander texted back: &quot;So do I.&quot;<br/><br/>But even as he returned to reviewing security protocols, a nagging doubt crept into his mind. What if it wasn&#x27;t enough? What if Rose had found a way around all their precautions?<br/><br/>What if Camille&#x27;s nightmare was a warning?<br/><br/>* * *</div>
