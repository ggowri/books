        <h1>Chapter 102-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 102<br/><br/>Rain streaked down the windows of Herod Preston&#x27;s penthouse, turning Manhattan&#x27;s skyline into a blurry watercolor painting. Rose stood at the glass, watching lightning flash between the clouds. Her reflection stared back at her, a ghost of herself caught between the storm outside and the one brewing within.<br/><br/>Behind her, Herod ended his phone call and set his cell on the marble counter with a soft click. The sound pulled Rose from her thoughts.<br/><br/>&quot;Well?&quot; she asked, not turning around.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s confirmed.&quot; His voice carried that smooth confidence that had first drawn her to him. &quot;Walsh says construction is proceeding exactly according to our modified plans. He installed the final set of altered circuit boards himself this morning.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose pressed her palm against the cool glass. &quot;And no one noticed the changes?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No one. Not even the chief engineer.&quot; His footsteps approached, slow and measured. &quot;The beauty of our modifications is their subtlety. Each change looks legitimate on its own. Only when viewed collectively do they create the perfect storm.&quot;<br/><br/>A smile touched Rose&#x27;s lips. Perfect storm. How fitting. She&#x27;d spent her entire life creating storms in Camille&#x27;s perfect world.<br/><br/>&quot;How long until it fails?&quot; she asked.<br/><br/>&quot;The Grid goes fully operational in six days.&quot; Herod now stood directly behind her, close enough that she could feel his body heat. &quot;The safety systems are designed to run seventy-two hours of testing before full power integration. Once they connect to the city&#x27;s main power supply...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Boom,&quot; Rose whispered, watching lightning split the sky.<br/><br/>&quot;Precisely.&quot; His hand came to rest on her shoulder. &quot;And Camille Kane will be held responsible for the greatest engineering disaster in New York&#x27;s history.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose turned to face him. Herod&#x27;s dark eyes held hers, intense and unreadable. She&#x27;d worked with him for weeks now, plotting Camille&#x27;s destruction, yet sometimes he remained a mystery. A dangerous one.<br/><br/>&quot;Victoria will protect her,&quot; Rose said, her old bitterness rising. &quot;She always protects her precious new daughter.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Not this time.&quot; Herod&#x27;s thumb traced a small circle on her shoulder, the gesture oddly intimate. &quot;The evidence will be overwhelming. Criminal negligence at minimum. Potentially even charges of knowingly endangering public safety for profit.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Prison,&quot; Rose breathed, the word sweet on her tongue.<br/><br/>&quot;If she&#x27;s lucky.&quot; Herod&#x27;s mouth curved into a smile that never reached his eyes. &quot;More likely, Victoria Kane&#x27;s empire will collapse trying to defend against the lawsuits. The stock will plummet. The board will remove them both. And I&#x27;ll be there to pick up the pieces at pennies on the dollar.&quot;<br/><br/>He moved to the bar, pouring amber liquid into two crystal glasses. &quot;A perfect revenge for both of us. Victoria loses everything, just as my family did. And your sister...&quot; He handed Rose a glass. &quot;Your sister loses her freedom, her reputation, and her new mother figure, all at once.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose accepted the drink, the crystal cool against her fingers. &quot;To perfect revenge,&quot; she said, raising her glass.<br/><br/>&quot;To mutual satisfaction.&quot; Herod clinked his glass against hers, his eyes never leaving her face as they both drank.<br/><br/>The liquor burned pleasantly down Rose&#x27;s throat. She wandered to the large desk where multiple screens displayed different angles of the Phoenix Grid construction site. Workers in hard hats moved about like industrious ants, unwittingly building a disaster.<br/><br/>&quot;Look at them,&quot; she murmured. &quot;No idea what&#x27;s coming.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod moved beside her, setting his glass down on the desk. &quot;Do you ever wonder,&quot; he asked, his voice lower now, &quot;what you&#x27;ll do after?&quot;<br/><br/>The question caught Rose off-guard. She&#x27;d been so focused on destroying Camille, on taking back what should have been hers, that she&#x27;d given little thought to what came next.<br/><br/>&quot;After?&quot; she repeated.<br/><br/>&quot;After Camille is disgraced. After Victoria&#x27;s empire falls.&quot; His eyes studied her face. &quot;After you&#x27;ve won.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose considered the question. Before meeting Herod, her vision had extended only to Camille&#x27;s destruction. But working with him had awakened something new in her, ambition beyond mere revenge.<br/><br/>&quot;I haven&#x27;t decided,&quot; she admitted. &quot;What about you? After you buy Kane Industries for nothing, what then?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I rebuild it. Rebrand it. Turn it into something greater than Victoria ever imagined.&quot; He leaned against the desk, facing her. &quot;But businesses are only as strong as the people who run them.&quot;<br/><br/>The implication hung in the air between them. Rose set her glass down beside his, suddenly aware of how close they stood, how alone they were in the vast penthouse with the storm raging outside.<br/><br/>&quot;Are you offering me a job, Herod?&quot; she asked, her voice deliberately light.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m suggesting a partnership.&quot; His eyes darkened. &quot;We work well together, Rose. We understand each other in ways few people could. We both know what it means to be overlooked, underestimated, denied what&#x27;s rightfully ours.&quot;<br/><br/>Lightning flashed again, briefly illuminating the room in harsh white light. In that flash, Rose saw something in Herod&#x27;s face, hunger, yes, but also something that looked almost like vulnerability.<br/><br/>&quot;A business partnership?&quot; she asked, stepping closer.<br/><br/>&quot;To start.&quot; His voice dropped lower. &quot;Though I find myself wondering if it might become something more.&quot;<br/><br/>The confession surprised her. In their weeks of planning, Herod had been all cold calculation and strategic thinking. This hint of personal interest was unexpected, and strangely thrilling.<br/><br/>&quot;Something more,&quot; she echoed, testing the words. &quot;Like what?&quot;<br/><br/>Instead of answering, Herod reached out, brushing a strand of hair from her face. The gesture was tentative, almost gentle, at odds with the ruthless businessman she&#x27;d come to know.<br/><br/>&quot;I didn&#x27;t plan for this,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;When I agreed to help you destroy Camille Kane, I saw it as a means to my own revenge against Victoria. Nothing more.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And now?&quot; Rose asked, her heart beating faster.</div>
