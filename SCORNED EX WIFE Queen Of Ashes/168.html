        <h1>Chapter 112-2</h1>
        <div><br/>&quot;A specialized surgical procedure followed by targeted immunotherapy,&quot; Dr. Chen explained. &quot;There&#x27;s a new clinical trial showing promising results with cases similar to Ms. Kane&#x27;s. It won&#x27;t be easy, but she&#x27;s otherwise in excellent health, which significantly improves her prospects.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille&#x27;s mind raced back through the past weeks. Victoria working later than usual. Meals left half-finished. The slight stiffness in her movements that Camille had attributed to tension over Rose and Herod&#x27;s plotting.<br/><br/>&quot;What&#x27;s the timeline for treatment?&quot; Camille asked, forcing her voice to remain steady.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;d want to begin as soon as possible,&quot; Dr. Chen replied. &quot;The surgery could be scheduled within days, followed by recovery and then immunotherapy. The full course would take several months.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Is there family we should contact?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m her daughter,&quot; Camille said, the words emerging with unexpected certainty. &quot;I&#x27;m all the family she has.&quot;<br/><br/>Dr. Chen nodded. &quot;She&#x27;s asking for you. She&#x27;s heavily sedated, but conscious. Room 718.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille moved through the corridor like a sleepwalker, the doctor&#x27;s words cycling through her mind. Cancer. Advanced. A few months.<br/><br/>She paused outside Room 718, drawing a deep breath before pushing the door open.<br/><br/>Victoria lay against white sheets, looking ghostly under the harsh hospital lighting. Gone was the commanding presence that filled boardrooms with a single glance. In its place lay a woman suddenly revealed as mortal, tethered to machines that beeped and hummed.<br/><br/>Her eyes opened as Camille approached the bed.<br/><br/>&quot;I told them... not to tell you yet,&quot; Victoria murmured, her voice raspy. &quot;Wanted to... handle it myself.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille sat carefully on the edge of the bed, taking Victoria&#x27;s hand. IV lines snaked from her arm, a stark reminder of her vulnerability.<br/><br/>&quot;How long have you known?&quot; Camille asked.<br/><br/>&quot;Suspected... two weeks,&quot; Victoria admitted. &quot;Confirmed... three days ago.&quot;<br/><br/>Shock jolted through Camille. &quot;Three days? Why didn&#x27;t you say anything?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The Grid,&quot; Victoria said simply. &quot;Couldn&#x27;t... risk distraction. Too important.&quot;<br/><br/>The implication stunned Camille. Victoria had received a cancer diagnosis and said nothing, continuing to fight Rose and Herod&#x27;s sabotage as if nothing had changed.<br/><br/>&quot;The doctor mentioned a new treatment,&quot; Camille said, hope threading through her voice. &quot;A surgical procedure and immunotherapy. She says there&#x27;s a good chance...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I know,&quot; Victoria interrupted. &quot;Already... discussed options.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;So you&#x27;ll do it?&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s eyes locked with Camille&#x27;s, some of her usual strength returning to her gaze. &quot;Yes. But no one... can know. No one.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Victoria, the company needs to...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No.&quot; The word came sharp and clear. &quot;If Rose and Herod... learn I&#x27;m weakened... they&#x27;ll accelerate their plans. Need time... to prepare.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille understood immediately. In business, as in war, any sign of vulnerability would be exploited mercilessly. If word got out that Victoria Kane was hospitalized with cancer, Kane Industries&#x27; stock would plummet, investors would panic, and their enemies would strike.<br/><br/>&quot;Alexander already knows something&#x27;s wrong,&quot; Camille said quietly.<br/><br/>Victoria nodded slightly. &quot;Tell him... the truth. No one else. Not even... the board.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The Grid,&quot; Victoria said after a moment. &quot;Section B?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Online,&quot; Camille assured her. &quot;Everything worked perfectly. No sign of interference.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria nodded slightly, satisfaction briefly overtaking the pain in her expression. &quot;Good. But they&#x27;ll... still move against us. You must be... ready.&quot;<br/><br/>Even now, lying in a hospital bed, Victoria&#x27;s mind remained fixed on the battle ahead.<br/><br/>&quot;Don&#x27;t worry about Rose and Herod,&quot; she said. &quot;Alexander and I will handle them. You need to focus on getting better.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s lips curved in what might have been a smile. &quot;Will get better... but recovery takes time. Need you to... lead in my absence.&quot;<br/><br/>Her eyes drifted closed momentarily, then opened with visible effort. &quot;There&#x27;s a file... in my personal safe. Combination... Sophia&#x27;s birthday. Instructions for... everything. Contingency plans.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded, filing the information away. &quot;I&#x27;ll take care of everything until you&#x27;re back.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I know,&quot; Victoria said, her voice growing fainter as the medication pulled her toward sleep. &quot;That&#x27;s why... I chose you.&quot;<br/><br/>A nurse entered quietly, checking Victoria&#x27;s vital signs. &quot;She needs to rest now,&quot; she told Camille gently.<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s hand tightened on Camille&#x27;s. &quot;Remember... tell no one,&quot; she murmured, already drifting under the influence of medication.<br/><br/>&quot;I promise,&quot; Camille said softly.<br/><br/>After the nurse left, Camille sat in silence, watching Victoria&#x27;s chest rise and fall with each breath. The formidable woman who had transformed her from a broken victim into a force to be reckoned with now looked strangely vulnerable against the sterile white sheets.<br/><br/>Her phone vibrated. Alexander, again. She glanced at the screen.<br/><br/>*Need to talk. Urgent. Something&#x27;s happening with Kane Industries stock.*<br/><br/>Camille looked from the phone to Victoria&#x27;s sleeping face. The battle was still raging, and now she would have to lead it temporarily. Rose and Herod were making their move, just as Victoria had predicted.<br/><br/>She rose quietly and moved to the window, staring out at the city skyline. Somewhere out there, Rose and Herod were celebrating what they thought was their approaching victory, unaware that everything had just changed.<br/><br/>This wasn&#x27;t just about revenge anymore. This wasn&#x27;t just about the Grid. This was about protecting Victoria&#x27;s empire while she fought her private battle, giving her the time she needed to recover and reclaim her place.<br/><br/>Camille texted Alexander back:<br/><br/>*Coming now. Meeting room in the east wing. Will explain everything.*<br/><br/>She returned to Victoria&#x27;s bedside, carefully adjusting the blanket over her sleeping form. &quot;I&#x27;ll be back soon,&quot; she whispered. &quot;I promise.&quot;<br/><br/>As she walked from the room, Camille straightened her spine, lifted her chin, and schooled her features into the mask of calm authority that Victoria had taught her to wear. There would be time for worry later. Now, she had a war to win.<br/><br/>For Victoria. For herself. For the time they would still have together once this battle was won.<br/></div>
