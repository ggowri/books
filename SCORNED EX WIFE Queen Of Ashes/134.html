        <div>Chapter 93<br/><br/>Camille&#x27;s phone buzzed against the boardroom table, its vibration cutting through her presentation. She glanced at the screen and felt her stomach drop.<br/><br/>&quot;Excuse me,&quot; she said, her voice steadier than she felt. &quot;Let&#x27;s take a five-minute break.&quot;<br/><br/>As the engineering team filed out, Camille opened the alert.<br/><br/>*BREAKING: Kane Industries (KI) down 8.7% on rumors of Phoenix Grid safety concerns*<br/><br/>She scrolled quickly to a financial blog post: &quot;SOURCES CLAIM PHOENIX GRID POSES UNPRECEDENTED FIRE RISK.&quot;<br/><br/>The article cited &quot;anonymous whistleblowers inside Kane Engineering&quot; who allegedly provided documents showing the power distribution nodes could overheat under certain conditions. The claims were vague but specific enough to sound credible.<br/><br/>Camille called Victoria. No answer. She tried Alexander next.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ve seen it,&quot; he said immediately. &quot;PR is already crafting a response.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Who would do this?&quot; Camille demanded, pacing the empty boardroom. &quot;Three days before groundbreaking? This isn&#x27;t coincidence.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No,&quot; Alexander agreed, his voice tight. &quot;It&#x27;s coordinated. The same story appeared simultaneously on four different financial platforms. Our stock dropped the moment markets opened.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille glanced at the wall of glass. Engineers huddled nearby, faces worried, stealing glances toward her.<br/><br/>&quot;Get Hannah Zhao on this immediately,&quot; she ordered. &quot;I want a comprehensive safety report ready by this afternoon—something clear enough for the media to understand.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Already happening,&quot; Alexander assured her. &quot;Victoria&#x27;s called an emergency press conference for two o&#x27;clock.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille checked her watch: 10:17 AM. Less than four hours to contain a crisis.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ll be there,&quot; she said. &quot;I need to finish with the engineering team first.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Camille,&quot; Alexander&#x27;s voice softened. &quot;This will pass. The Phoenix Grid is sound. We both know that.&quot;<br/><br/>She ended the call, took a deep breath, and opened the door to call back the engineers. Their anxious faces told her rumors had already spread.<br/><br/>&quot;I assume you&#x27;ve all heard,&quot; she said directly. &quot;Let me be clear: The Phoenix Grid design is sound. These allegations are baseless. But we will address them with facts, not defensiveness.&quot;<br/><br/>Hannah Zhao, the lead engineer, stepped forward. &quot;The distribution nodes have been tested far beyond normal parameters. They simply cannot cause fires as described.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Someone fabricated concerns,&quot; Camille agreed. &quot;Our job now is to prove it. Hannah, I need your team to prepare a comprehensive safety assessment. Every test, every safety margin, every redundancy. Two o&#x27;clock deadline.&quot;<br/><br/>As the team dispersed, Hannah lingered behind.<br/><br/>&quot;Ms. Kane,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;these allegations contain technical details that only someone with inside knowledge could know.&quot;<br/><br/>The implication hung in the air. A leak. A betrayal from within.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m aware,&quot; Camille replied. &quot;Let&#x27;s focus on the facts first. We&#x27;ll deal with how this happened afterward.&quot;<br/><br/>*** **<br/><br/>Two floors below, Victoria Kane stood in her office, watching financial news coverage. The ticker showed Kane Industries down 11.3%. She held her phone to her ear.<br/><br/>&quot;Find out who&#x27;s behind this,&quot; she ordered. &quot;Check trading patterns. Someone is profiting from this drop.&quot;<br/><br/>She ended the call as her assistant entered with printouts of every article mentioning the allegations.<br/><br/>&quot;The technical team is preparing a detailed response,&quot; the assistant reported. &quot;And Mr. Pierce is on his way.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria scanned the articles. Something in the phrasing caught her attention, targeting not just the technology but subtly undermining Camille&#x27;s judgment.<br/><br/>Her eyes narrowed. This had Rose&#x27;s fingerprints all over it. But Rose had been in hiding since the press conference disaster. This attack was too well-orchestrated for Rose alone.<br/><br/>She had help. Significant help.<br/><br/>When Alexander arrived, Victoria didn&#x27;t bother with greetings.<br/><br/>&quot;This is a coordinated attack,&quot; she said, handing him the most damaging article. &quot;Look at the technical specifics, someone with engineering knowledge helped prepare this.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander scanned the document. &quot;The details are close enough to our actual specs to sound legitimate, but with key differences.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Suggesting?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Someone with partial knowledge,&quot; he concluded. &quot;Not current blueprints, but perhaps earlier versions.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria moved to the window. &quot;I want every former employee with technical knowledge investigated. Every contractor, every consultant.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Already underway,&quot; Alexander assured her. &quot;Security is also checking for digital breaches.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And Rose?&quot; Victoria turned back. &quot;What&#x27;s she been doing since the press conference?&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander shook his head. &quot;Gone dark. No credit card usage, no phone activity. She&#x27;s effectively disappeared.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Nobody disappears that completely without help,&quot; Victoria observed. &quot;Someone is sheltering her, funding her.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The question is who,&quot; Alexander agreed. &quot;And why target the Phoenix Grid specifically?&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s expression hardened. &quot;Because it&#x27;s Camille&#x27;s project. Her vision. Her redemption. Attacking it is personal.&quot;<br/><br/>** **<br/><br/>The Kane Industries press room buzzed with media activity. Television cameras lined the back wall as reporters filled every seat.<br/><br/>Camille stood backstage, reviewing her notes. Victoria beside her, both women dressed in nearly identical charcoal suits, a united front.<br/><br/>&quot;Remember,&quot; Victoria said quietly, &quot;no defensiveness. No anger. Just facts, confidence, and absolute certainty in our technology.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander appeared, tablet in hand. &quot;Hannah&#x27;s report is ready. Comprehensive, clear, and irrefutable.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Who leaked the specifications?&quot; Camille asked, keeping her voice low.<br/><br/>Alexander shook his head. &quot;Not yet. But the technical details weren&#x27;t entirely accurate, close enough to seem legitimate, but with key differences.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Meaning?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Someone with partial knowledge,&quot; he clarified. &quot;Not a current insider with full access.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille&#x27;s mind immediately went to Rose. &quot;It&#x27;s her. Rose is behind this.&quot;</div>
