        <h1>Chapter 72-2</h1>
        <div><br/>The question hit harder than I expected. For two years, every thought, every action, every decision had been filtered through the lens of revenge. I had become Camille Kane for the sole purpose of destroying Rose and Stefan. What happened when that purpose was fulfilled?<br/><br/>&quot;I don&#x27;t know,&quot; I admitted, the vulnerable truth surprising us both.<br/><br/>Victoria rose, moving to stand directly before me. &quot;Two years ago, I found you in that parking garage. Beaten. Bleeding. Those men Rose had hired to &#x27;teach you a lesson&#x27; had nearly killed you.&quot;<br/><br/>I nodded, remembering that night with painful clarity. The brutal attack that Rose had arranged after I&#x27;d confronted her about Stefan. Victoria appearing like some avenging angel, her driver scattering my attackers, her calm voice directing paramedics even as she offered me a choice I&#x27;d never imagined possible.<br/><br/>&quot;I offered you a choice,&quot; Victoria continued. &quot;Disappear into anonymity and lick your wounds, or rise transformed and claim justice.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I chose transformation,&quot; I said softly. &quot;I chose strength over victimhood. Strategy over emotion.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We created the drowning story together,&quot; Victoria reminded me. &quot;A way to explain your disappearance while giving us time for your recovery, for the surgeries, for your training. No one ever questioned it because no one was truly looking for you.&quot;<br/><br/>The painful truth hung between us. No search parties. No desperate appeals from my parents. No reward offered for information. Just a tasteful memorial service and life continuing for everyone who should have cared that I was gone.<br/><br/>&quot;The drowning story served its purpose,&quot; I said, pushing away the hurt that still lingered beneath my carefully constructed exterior. &quot;And now the truth will serve an even greater one.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria touched my shoulder briefly, a rare physical gesture from a woman who typically maintained careful distance. &quot;Don&#x27;t lose your strength now that victory is within reach.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I won&#x27;t,&quot; I promised, drawing myself straighter. &quot;But I need to figure out who Camille Kane becomes after revenge is complete.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria returned to the guest list, studying the names with calculating eyes. &quot;Each person on this list will react differently to your revelation. Rose with fury and denial. Stefan with shock and guilt. The business community with fascination and reassessment of your capabilities.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And my parents?&quot; I asked, the question slipping out before I could stop it.<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s expression hardened slightly. &quot;They forfeited any right to your consideration when they accepted your death so easily. When they didn&#x27;t question the convenient story. When they embraced Rose as their remaining daughter without ever demanding a proper investigation.&quot;<br/><br/>She was right, of course. Among all the betrayals, my parents&#x27; easy acceptance of my disappearance had cut perhaps the deepest. Their grief had been real but brief, their focus quickly returning to Rose&#x27;s achievements, her fashion career, her engagement to my husband.<br/><br/>&quot;They&#x27;ll be there,&quot; I said, studying the guest list again. &quot;Front row seats to understand exactly what their choices cost.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria nodded approvingly. &quot;The event planning team needs final approval on the stage design. I&#x27;ve scheduled them for three o&#x27;clock.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Perfect. I want everything exactly right.&quot; I moved toward the door, then paused. &quot;Victoria? Thank you. For finding me that night. For offering me a choice when I had none.&quot;<br/><br/>Something almost soft flickered across her typically impassive features. &quot;We all deserve the chance to write our own endings, Camille. Even if that means first tearing apart someone else&#x27;s carefully constructed story.&quot;<br/><br/>I left her office with renewed determination, the guest list for the Phoenix Gala burning in my mind like a promise. Two weeks. Two weeks until masks fell away. Until truth emerged from carefully crafted lies. Until Rose and Stefan and everyone who had harmed me understood exactly who had orchestrated their destruction.<br/><br/>The elevator carried me down to the design department, where samples of invitation designs awaited my approval. I studied each option, finally selecting a sleek black card with a single gold phoenix rising from flames. No explanation. No hint at the true nature of the event. Just a symbol of rebirth that only I would fully understand until the night itself.<br/><br/>&quot;Perfect,&quot; I told the waiting designer. &quot;Send these out immediately. Priority delivery to everyone on the approved list.&quot;<br/><br/>As the designer hurried away to execute my instructions, I allowed myself a rare, genuine smile. In two weeks, society&#x27;s elite would gather, expecting another lavish Kane industry announcement. Instead, they would witness the return of a woman everyone believed dead. Would see the mask of Camille Kane fall away to reveal Camille Lewis, transformed, empowered, and finally claiming the justice she deserved.<br/><br/>Rose would understand at last who had systematically destroyed everything she valued. Stefan would finally face the consequences of his betrayal. And the world would learn that sometimes, the dead don&#x27;t stay buried. Sometimes, they rise from ashes, transformed into something more powerful than anyone could have imagined.<br/><br/>The Phoenix Gala wouldn&#x27;t just be a revelation. It would be my declaration of existence. My reclaiming of a life that others had tried to erase. And perhaps, though I wasn&#x27;t ready to admit it even to myself, the first step toward discovering who I might become when revenge no longer defined my every thought and action.<br/><br/>Two weeks. The countdown had begun.<br/></div>
