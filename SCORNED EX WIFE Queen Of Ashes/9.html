        <h1>Chapter 9</h1>
        <div><p>Chapter 9<br/><br/>Victoria stopped at a heavy wooden door, unlocking it with a key from her robe pocket. Inside was a home gym unlike any I&#x27;d ever seen, state-of-the-art equipment, mirrors covering one wall, a boxing ring taking up the center of the room.<br/><br/>She flipped on lights that mimicked daylight, making me blink at the sudden brightness. Without a word, she crossed to a cabinet and extracted hand wraps and boxing gloves.<br/><br/>&quot;Put these on.&quot;<br/><br/>I took them, bewildered. &quot;Victoria, it&#x27;s the middle of the night.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And you&#x27;re awake, drowning in self-pity instead of planning your resurrection.&quot; Her voice wasn&#x27;t cruel, just matter-of-fact. &quot;So put them on.&quot;<br/><br/>My hands trembled as I wrapped them, clumsy from inexperience. Victoria watched, neither helping nor criticizing, until I managed to secure the gloves.<br/><br/>&quot;Hit that.&quot; She pointed to a heavy bag hanging in the corner.<br/><br/>I approached it uncertainly. &quot;I&#x27;ve never boxed before.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m not teaching you to box. I&#x27;m teaching you to channel your rage.&quot; She positioned herself behind the bag, holding it steady. &quot;Now hit it. Hard as you can.&quot;<br/><br/>Feeling foolish, I threw a weak punch. The bag barely moved.<br/><br/>&quot;Again. Harder. Think of Rose&#x27;s face when she saw you at the house that day.&quot;<br/><br/>I hit again, putting slightly more force behind it.<br/><br/>&quot;Pathetic. Is that all the anger you have? After what she did to you?&quot; Victoria&#x27;s voice hardened. &quot;Think of Stefan signing those divorce papers on your anniversary. Think of your mother comforting Rose while you walked away bleeding.&quot;<br/><br/>Heat bloomed in my chest, anger flickering to life. I threw another punch, then another, each one harder than the last.<br/><br/>&quot;Better. Now think of them laughing in that restaurant. Toasting your destruction. Planning your replacement.&quot;<br/><br/>The image from my nightmare flashed before me, champagne glasses clinking, Rose wearing my ring, Stefan in the tie I&#x27;d given him. Something snapped inside me. My next punch slammed into the bag with a force that surprised even me.<br/><br/>&quot;Yes!&quot; Victoria&#x27;s approval fueled me. &quot;Again. Think of the men who attacked you. Think of your parents choosing Rose over you for fourteen years.&quot;<br/><br/>I lost myself in the rhythm of it, fists connecting with leather again and again. Each punch carried away a piece of hurt, of betrayal, of worthlessness. I hit until my arms burned and sweat soaked my nightgown, until tears mixed with perspiration on my face.<br/><br/>I hit until I had nothing left.<br/><br/>When I finally stopped, chest heaving, Victoria released the bag and handed me a towel without comment. I wiped my face, suddenly exhausted but oddly... cleaner somehow. Like I&#x27;d purged something toxic from my system.<br/><br/>&quot;This is the last time,&quot; Victoria said, unwrapping the gloves from my hands. &quot;The last time you break for them. The last time you cry over people who never deserved your tears.&quot;<br/><br/>I met her eyes, seeing not pity but recognition. Understanding. She knew this journey because she&#x27;d walked it herself.<br/><br/>&quot;Tomorrow, we begin.&quot; She checked her watch, a discreet Patek Philippe that probably cost more than a year&#x27;s rent at my old apartment. &quot;In exactly four hours, you&#x27;ll meet with the lawyers to finalize the adoption papers. By noon, you&#x27;ll be legally Camille Kane. By evening, you&#x27;ll have begun your education in finance, business strategy, and social warfare.&quot;<br/><br/>She tossed the gloves into a basket and turned to face me fully, silver hair gleaming under the lights.<br/><br/>&quot;Tonight was necessary. Grief must be acknowledged before it can be transformed. But from sunrise onward, you are no longer their victim. You are my protégé. My heir. My daughter.&quot;<br/><br/>The word &#x27;daughter&#x27; hung in the air between us, weighted with expectations and possibilities. I straightened my shoulders, ignoring the protest from my ribs.<br/><br/>&quot;What if I&#x27;m not strong enough?&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s smile was sharp as a blade. &quot;Strength isn&#x27;t something you&#x27;re born with. It&#x27;s something you build, one painful brick at a time. And you, Camille, have been gathering bricks for years without knowing it.&quot;<br/><br/>She moved toward the door, pausing with her hand on the light switch. &quot;Each betrayal, each disappointment, each moment they underestimated you – those are your building materials. Now we construct something magnificent from them.&quot;<br/><br/>I followed her from the gym, back through silent hallways that would soon become familiar. My home. My fortress. My launching pad.<br/><br/>At my bedroom door, Victoria paused. For a moment, I thought she might embrace me, offer some maternal comfort after the night&#x27;s emotional storm. Instead, she simply touched my shoulder, a brief pressure that conveyed more than words could have.<br/><br/>&quot;Sleep if you can,&quot; she said. &quot;If not, start reading the files I left on your desk. The first details your sister&#x27;s recent business ventures. She&#x27;s seeking investors for a boutique clothing line, apparently.&quot;<br/><br/>An investor. Rose, who&#x27;d stolen my husband, my family, my dignity, was now seeking money. The irony was almost poetic.<br/><br/>&quot;How long before she knows?&quot; I asked. &quot;That I&#x27;m alive. That I&#x27;m... yours.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s smile held all the warm comfort of a circling shark. &quot;We&#x27;ll wait until you&#x27;re ready. Until you can look her in the eye and feel nothing but cold satisfaction. Until your hand doesn&#x27;t shake when you sign the papers denying her funding.&quot;<br/><br/>I nodded, something new settling into my bones. Something hard and certain.<br/><br/>&quot;Rest,&quot; Victoria said, turning away. &quot;Tomorrow is the first day of your new life.&quot;<br/><br/>I entered my room, closing the door softly behind me. The nightmare&#x27;s grip had faded, replaced by something sharper, clearer. Purpose. Direction. For the first time in years, perhaps ever, I knew exactly who I needed to become.<br/><br/>Not the good sister. Not the perfect wife. Not the pleasing daughter.<br/><br/>Someone new. Someone dangerous.<br/><br/>Someone who would make them all regret the day they decided Camille Lewis wasn&#x27;t worth keeping.<br/><br/>I caught my reflection in the window glass, disheveled, eyes red-rimmed, but standing straight. <br/><br/></p><p></p></div>
