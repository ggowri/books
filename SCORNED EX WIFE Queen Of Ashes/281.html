        <h1>Chapter 179-2</h1>
        <div><br/>&quot;The press loves a good dynasty story,&quot; Alexander said. &quot;The combination of your family&#x27;s old money heritage and our corporate empires makes for irresistible coverage.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m just glad they didn&#x27;t exaggerate the tension between Victoria and my parents,&quot; Camille said. &quot;Their relationship may be strictly cordial, but they&#x27;ve been remarkably civil since the reconciliation began.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;They all want what&#x27;s best for you,&quot; Alexander pointed out. &quot;That&#x27;s common ground no matter their differences.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille considered this. The press had indeed shifted how they portrayed her relationship with Alexander. What had begun as speculation about a business merger or Victoria&#x27;s succession plan had evolved into something the public found irresistible, a love story emerging from tragedy, two powerful individuals joining forces both personally and professionally, with the added dimension of family healing across different social worlds.<br/><br/>The phoenix motif that had started with Camille&#x27;s pendant, then appeared in their engagement ring design and later in their joint business ventures, had captured the public&#x27;s imagination. Where Victoria had once taught Camille to use symbols to intimidate, now those same symbols served a different purpose, inspiring hope and possibility.<br/><br/>&quot;Do you think the media attention will ever die down?&quot; she asked.<br/><br/>Alexander shook his head. &quot;Not completely. We&#x27;re too visible now. But we can control the narrative better than most.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And what is our narrative?&quot; Camille asked, genuinely curious about how he saw their story.<br/><br/>Alexander considered before answering. &quot;That real strength isn&#x27;t about revenge or power for its own sake. It&#x27;s about building something meaningful from pain. It&#x27;s about choosing creation over destruction.&quot;<br/><br/>His words hit her with unexpected force. Wasn&#x27;t that exactly what she&#x27;d been trying to do since Rose&#x27;s conviction? What she hoped to continue with their marriage and whatever came after?<br/><br/>&quot;I can live with that story,&quot; she said softly.<br/><br/>Returning to the wedding binder, Camille flipped through venue options with new purpose. &quot;Let&#x27;s visit the lakeside property this weekend. Before Victoria persuades us to host at some ultra-modern venue that wouldn&#x27;t suit us at all.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Agreed,&quot; Alexander said, checking his calendar. &quot;And perhaps we should call your parents. See if they want to join us for the site visit.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded, reaching for her phone. The invitation would be another small step in strengthening the bonds between all parts of her life.<br/><br/>&quot;Mom? It&#x27;s me,&quot; she said when Margaret answered. &quot;Alexander and I are going to look at a potential wedding venue this weekend. Would you and Dad like to join us?&quot;<br/><br/>Her mother&#x27;s voice came through, polished and warm. &quot;We&#x27;d love to, darling. Actually, Victoria called this morning about the engagement party. She mentioned you might be considering a venue outside the city.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;She did?&quot; Camille wasn&#x27;t surprised that Victoria had already touched base with her mother. Their cordial relationship had evolved to include regular communication about matters concerning Camille, though she knew they weren&#x27;t exactly friends.<br/><br/>&quot;Yes, she asked for my opinion on having live music versus a DJ for the engagement party. I suggested the string quartet that played at the Whitfields&#x27; anniversary. I hope that&#x27;s alright?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s perfect, Mom. I&#x27;m glad you two are coordinating.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Well, your father and Victoria have been discussing business opportunities lately, so we&#x27;ve been in more regular contact,&quot; Margaret explained. &quot;Nothing serious, just exploring some potential philanthropic partnerships. It&#x27;s been... enlightening.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille raised an eyebrow, surprised but pleased. Her mother&#x27;s diplomatic phrasing told her everything she needed to know: Victoria and her parents maintained their cordial relationship without forcing artificial closeness, finding appropriate ways to interact that respected their different backgrounds and perspectives.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;ll be at Victoria&#x27;s by ten on Saturday to discuss final arrangements for the engagement party,&quot; Margaret continued. &quot;Should we meet you at the venue after that?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That would be perfect,&quot; Camille replied, jotting down the details. &quot;I&#x27;ll text you the address.&quot;<br/><br/>After she hung up, Camille sat quietly, absorbing the weight of that exchange. Alexander watched her, giving her the space to process.<br/><br/>&quot;It sounds like they&#x27;re all working together better than I realized,&quot; she said finally.<br/><br/>&quot;Your parents and Victoria have found their balance,&quot; he pointed out. &quot;They each bring something valuable to the table, and they all care about you.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded, turning back to the wedding binder. As she flipped through options for flowers and music, she felt a lightness she hadn&#x27;t expected. Rose was in prison. Victoria&#x27;s cancer was responding to treatment. Her parents and Victoria maintained their cordial relationship without strain or pretense. And here sat Alexander, steady and sure beside her.<br/><br/>For the first time in years, perhaps ever, Camille allowed herself to imagine a future built not around survival or revenge, but around joy. A future where the past informed but did not dictate her choices. Where damaged relationships could heal, though the scars would always remain.<br/><br/>&quot;What are you thinking about?&quot; Alexander asked, noting her pause.<br/><br/>&quot;That it might actually be possible to be happy,&quot; Camille said. &quot;Really happy, not just safe or successful.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s smile warmed his entire face. &quot;That&#x27;s the whole point of all this, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;<br/><br/>The wedding binder, the engagement party plans, the news articles celebrating their union, all of it suddenly felt like more than mere details or publicity. They were pieces of a life being built deliberately, thoughtfully, with love as its foundation rather than fear or obligation.<br/><br/>The true test would come at Victoria&#x27;s party, where the various spheres of Camille&#x27;s life would intersect more visibly than before. Victoria&#x27;s corporate power. Alexander&#x27;s innovative brilliance. Her parents&#x27; old-money pedigree. All circling around the woman who had been broken and reborn through fire.<br/><br/>Camille looked down at her phoenix ring, sunlight catching its facets and sending tiny rainbows across her desk. &quot;You know what? I think it is.&quot;<br/><br/>The future remained unwritten, with challenges ahead they couldn&#x27;t predict. Victoria&#x27;s health. The continued attention of the press. The evolving dynamic between Victoria and her parents. But for now, in this moment, planning a celebration of love felt like exactly the right thing to do.<br/><br/>A phoenix didn&#x27;t rise from the ashes to live in fear of the next fire. It rose to soar.<br/></div>
