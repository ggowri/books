        <h1>Chapter 75-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 75<br/><br/>Rose slammed her apartment door with such force that a framed photo crashed to the floor, glass shattering across the marble entryway. She didn&#x27;t bother to pick it up. Instead, she kicked off her heels, sending them flying across the room where one knocked over a crystal vase, water and flowers spilling onto the pristine white carpet.<br/><br/>She didn&#x27;t care. Nothing mattered anymore.<br/><br/>Her hands shook as she poured herself a drink, missing the glass entirely on the first try. Amber liquid pooled on the counter, but she ignored it, finally managing to fill the tumbler on her second attempt. She drained it in one gulp, the burn in her throat nothing compared to the inferno raging inside her chest.<br/><br/>&quot;She&#x27;s alive,&quot; Rose whispered, her voice raspy and strange to her own ears. &quot;All this time... she&#x27;s been alive.&quot;<br/><br/>The reality of what had happened at the gala crashed over her in waves. Camille, her pathetic, weak, doormat of a sister, had orchestrated her downfall. Camille, who had always been the good daughter, the perfect wife, the helpless victim, had been playing them all.<br/><br/>Rose hurled her empty glass across the living room where it exploded against the wall, leaving a dark stain on the cream-colored paint like a Rorschach test of her rage.<br/><br/>&quot;AAAGGHH!&quot; The scream that tore from her throat sounded animal, primal. Rose grabbed the nearest object, a glass paperweight, and smashed it into the mirror above her fireplace. Her reflection fractured into a thousand broken pieces.<br/><br/>Better. That felt better.<br/><br/>She moved through her apartment like a tornado, destroying everything in her path. Photo frames, vases, dishes, all shattered against walls, floors, windows. She tore designer clothes from her closet, ripping fabrics that had cost thousands, snapping heels off shoes, pulling jewelry apart until beads and gems scattered across the floor like tiny marbles.<br/><br/>When she reached the bedroom, she froze. There on the nightstand sat a photo of her and Stefan, happy, smiling, victorious. She had won him. She had taken him from Camille. He was supposed to be her prize.<br/><br/>Rose lifted the frame with trembling fingers. Stefan&#x27;s face stared back at her, the face she had desired for so long, the man who had been part of her meticulous plan.<br/><br/>&quot;You let her do this to us,&quot; she hissed at his image. &quot;You coward. You stood there and let her destroy everything!&quot;<br/><br/>She smashed the frame against the edge of the marble nightstand, glass cutting into her palm. Blood dripped onto the photo, staining his face red. Perfect. That&#x27;s what he deserved.<br/><br/>Rose sank onto the edge of her bed, suddenly exhausted. Her anger momentarily gave way to the crushing weight of what she had lost. Her business. Her reputation. Stefan. Even her place in the Lewis family seemed uncertain now, the way her mother had looked at her at the gala, with such disgust and disappointment.<br/><br/>She had spent years carefully building this life, crafting her image, positioning herself at the top of New York society. And in one night, Camille had taken it all away.<br/><br/>Rose pulled her knees to her chest, a sob rising in her throat. But no, she wouldn&#x27;t cry. Crying was weakness, and she wasn&#x27;t weak. She had survived foster homes where no one wanted her. She had fought her way into the Lewis family. She had built a fashion brand from nothing.<br/><br/>She was Rose Lewis. She didn&#x27;t break. She got even.<br/><br/>Rising from the bed, Rose went to her closet and pulled out the one box she hadn&#x27;t destroyed. Inside was a burner phone, cash, a passport with a different name, and account numbers for money she had hidden away years ago, her emergency escape plan. She had always been prepared for disaster, always had a backup plan. That&#x27;s how she had survived.<br/><br/>But she wasn&#x27;t going to run. Not this time.<br/><br/>Rose walked to her bathroom, ignoring the trail of destruction behind her. Blood still dripped from her cut palm, but she paid it no mind as she turned on the cold water and splashed her face. Mascara ran down her cheeks in black rivers, her carefully applied makeup washing away to reveal the woman beneath, harder, colder, more determined than the polished socialite she presented to the world.<br/><br/>She stared at herself in the mirror, water dripping from her chin.<br/><br/>&quot;This isn&#x27;t over,&quot; she whispered, echoing her words from the gala. &quot;Not by a long shot.&quot;<br/><br/>The shock was wearing off now, her mind beginning to work again, analyzing, calculating. Camille had help, that much was obvious. Victoria Kane. The powerful billionaire had taken Camille in, trained her, given her the resources to carry out this revenge.<br/><br/>Rose laughed, a harsh sound in the quiet bathroom.<br/><br/>&quot;So that&#x27;s who you are now, Camille? Victoria Kane&#x27;s pet project? Her weapon against me?&quot; She shook her head. &quot;She doesn&#x27;t know who she&#x27;s dealing with.&quot;</div>
