        <h1>Chapter 151-2</h1>
        <div><br/>&quot;They will,&quot; Alexander assured her. &quot;Now please, both of you, head to the private exit. I&#x27;ve already arranged for Victoria&#x27;s medical team to meet you at the safe house.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria nodded. &quot;Come, Camille. There&#x27;s nothing more we can do here.&quot;<br/><br/>But Camille didn&#x27;t move. Her eyes remained fixed on the ballroom, where elderly guests were struggling to rise from their seats, where waitstaff looked confused about whether to help or evacuate themselves, where mothers were calling for children who had wandered to the dessert table.<br/><br/>&quot;Camille,&quot; Alexander said more urgently. &quot;We need to go. Now.&quot;<br/><br/>She could feel the weight of Victoria&#x27;s hand on her arm, trying to pull her toward safety. But a deeper instinct held her in place.<br/><br/>&quot;I can help,&quot; she said. &quot;I can make them move faster.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s security&#x27;s job,&quot; Alexander insisted. &quot;Your job is to stay alive.&quot;<br/><br/>Through the growing chaos, Camille spotted her parents near the far exit, helping an elderly couple navigate the crowd. She saw donors who had contributed millions to her foundation, staff who had worked tirelessly to make this night possible, children who had no idea of the danger they were in.<br/><br/>All these people had come tonight because of her. Because of the Phoenix Foundation. Because they believed in her vision of helping others.<br/><br/>How could she run to safety while they remained at risk?<br/><br/>The timer in her mind continued its countdown. Twelve minutes. Maybe less.<br/><br/>&quot;Alexander.&quot; Camille&#x27;s voice had changed, taking on the steel she had learned from Victoria. &quot;Get Victoria out. Now. I&#x27;ll be right behind you.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We go together or not at all,&quot; Victoria said firmly.<br/><br/>&quot;No.&quot; Camille met Victoria&#x27;s gaze directly. &quot;You&#x27;re ill. You need to leave immediately. I&#x27;ll help with the evacuation and follow.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander stepped between them. &quot;Both of you need to leave. That&#x27;s non-negotiable.&quot;<br/><br/>But Camille had already made her decision. She turned toward the stage, toward the microphone that could reach every corner of the ballroom.<br/><br/>&quot;I can make them move faster,&quot; she said over her shoulder. &quot;I can save more people.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander grabbed her arm. &quot;Camille, listen to me. Rose did this. She set these bombs. She&#x27;s targeting you specifically.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I know.&quot; Camille&#x27;s eyes flashed with determination. &quot;That&#x27;s exactly why I can&#x27;t run. She wants me to be afraid. To panic. I won&#x27;t give her that satisfaction.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s voice cut through the tension between them. &quot;Alexander, get the car ready. We&#x27;ll be there in two minutes.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander hesitated, torn between his duty to protect both women and the knowledge that Victoria&#x27;s authority still outranked his in Camille&#x27;s mind.<br/><br/>&quot;Two minutes,&quot; he repeated, then moved toward the private exit to prepare their escape.<br/><br/>Once he was gone, Victoria turned to Camille. &quot;You have one minute to help, then we leave. Together. Understood?&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded, already moving toward the stage. The hotel manager looked relieved as she took the microphone from him.<br/><br/>&quot;Ladies and gentlemen,&quot; she began, her voice steady and clear. &quot;This is Camille Kane. I need your attention.&quot;<br/><br/>The crowd quieted, all eyes turning toward her.<br/><br/>&quot;We need to evacuate this building immediately. This is not a drill. Please move quickly to the nearest exit. Parents, carry your children. If you see someone struggling, help them. Leave all belongings behind.&quot;<br/><br/>The urgency in her voice cut through the confusion. People began moving more purposefully toward the exits, staff stepped up to assist elderly guests, the crowd&#x27;s pace visibly accelerated.<br/><br/>Victoria appeared at the edge of the stage. &quot;Time&#x27;s up,&quot; she said. &quot;We need to go.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille looked out across the ballroom, still half-full despite the increased pace of evacuation. The bitter knowledge that not everyone would make it out in time twisted in her stomach.<br/><br/>&quot;Camille,&quot; Victoria&#x27;s voice grew sharper. &quot;Now.&quot;<br/><br/>From somewhere in the building, a muffled boom sounded—the first device detonating early. Screams erupted as the lights flickered, panic threatening to overtake the ordered evacuation.<br/><br/>Camille grabbed the microphone again. &quot;Stay calm!&quot; she ordered. &quot;Continue moving toward the exits in an orderly fashion.&quot;<br/><br/>Her voice seemed to steady the crowd, but now people were pushing, the evacuation becoming more frantic.<br/><br/>Victoria had reached the stage steps, her face pale but determined. &quot;The car is waiting. Alexander says we have less than ten minutes.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille looked at the frightened faces below her, then at Victoria, the woman who had saved her life, who had given her a second chance, who was now dying and still thinking of others first.<br/><br/>&quot;You go,&quot; Camille said. &quot;I&#x27;ll be right behind you. I promise.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s expression hardened. &quot;I won&#x27;t leave you here.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You have to.&quot; Camille held Victoria&#x27;s gaze steadily. &quot;The foundation needs at least one of us to survive. And you need medical attention.&quot;<br/><br/>Another small explosion sounded from somewhere deeper in the building. More screams. More panic.<br/><br/>&quot;Go,&quot; Camille urged. &quot;Please. Let me do this. Let me help these people.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria stood frozen for a moment, torn between her instinct to protect Camille and the logic of her argument. Finally, she nodded.<br/><br/>&quot;Two minutes,&quot; she said. &quot;Then you follow. Swear it.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I swear,&quot; Camille replied, though they both knew it might be a promise she couldn&#x27;t keep.<br/><br/>Victoria moved toward the private exit, where Alexander waited. As she disappeared from view, Camille turned back to the crowd.<br/><br/>Nine minutes left. Hundreds still inside. Including her.<br/><br/>But she wouldn&#x27;t leave. Not yet. Not while she could still help.<br/><br/>Rose had designed this attack to destroy everything Camille had built. To kill her, yes, but also to shatter the foundation that bore her name. To turn a night of triumph into one of tragedy.<br/><br/>Camille wouldn&#x27;t let that happen. Even if it meant risking everything.<br/><br/>&quot;Keep moving!&quot; she called into the microphone. &quot;Security personnel, please assist with the elderly guests. Everyone else, please allow children and those needing assistance to exit first.&quot;<br/><br/>From the corner of her eye, Camille saw Alexander reappear at the private exit, his face taut with frustration and fear. He gestured urgently for her to come.<br/><br/>Camille shook her head. Not yet. Not until she had done everything possible to save these people who had trusted her enough to come tonight.<br/><br/>Not until she had proven, once and for all, that Rose&#x27;s attempts to destroy her had failed.<br/><br/>Eight minutes remained on the countdown. Eight minutes to define who she truly was.<br/><br/>And Camille Kane would not run.<br/></div>
