        <h1>Chapter 119-2</h1>
        <div><br/>Alexander met her gaze directly. &quot;They&#x27;re concerned about the suggestions of impropriety, but they&#x27;re standing behind me.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Because you control your company,&quot; Victoria observed. &quot;I control mine.&quot; She looked at Camille. &quot;Or rather, we do, together.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille felt a flicker of hope. Victoria wasn&#x27;t shutting her out.<br/><br/>&quot;What&#x27;s your assessment of the attack?&quot; Victoria asked.<br/><br/>Camille straightened. &quot;Two-pronged and sophisticated. The photos were meant to create scandal, distract, and embarrass. The financial allegations were the real attack, designed to undermine confidence in both Kane Industries and Pierce Enterprises simultaneously.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Making both companies vulnerable to acquisition,&quot; Alexander added.<br/><br/>&quot;Precisely,&quot; Victoria agreed. &quot;And your counter-strategy?&quot;<br/><br/>Camille hesitated. &quot;Conventionally, we would issue denials of the financial allegations, promise an investigation, and...&quot; She paused. &quot;And announce that Alexander and I would be maintaining a purely professional relationship going forward.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Conventional indeed,&quot; Victoria said, disapprovingly. &quot;And entirely reactive. You&#x27;re letting them dictate the terms of engagement.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What would you suggest?&quot; Alexander asked.<br/><br/>A hint of respect showed in Victoria&#x27;s expression. &quot;When attacked, advance. When they expect you to retreat, charge. When they expect denial, affirm.&quot;<br/><br/>She leaned forward slightly. &quot;They&#x27;ve exposed your relationship, expecting shame, expecting retreat. So instead, you confirm it. Proudly. On your terms.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille stared at her mentor, momentarily speechless. &quot;You want us to publicly acknowledge our relationship? After these photos?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I want you to seize control of the narrative,&quot; Victoria corrected. &quot;The photos exist. The relationship exists. Denying either makes you appear dishonest or ashamed.&quot;<br/><br/>She turned to Alexander. &quot;Your companies compete in some markets, but also collaborate in others. The Phoenix Grid uses Pierce technology. There&#x27;s no inherent conflict, just potential synergy.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The board won&#x27;t see it that way,&quot; Camille warned.<br/><br/>&quot;The board will see it however I tell them to see it,&quot; Victoria replied with steel in her voice. &quot;I still hold controlling interest.&quot;<br/><br/>She stood, moving to the window. &quot;The question isn&#x27;t what the board thinks. It&#x27;s what you two think. Is this relationship real? Or is it merely a distraction, a moment of weakness during a stressful time?&quot;<br/><br/>Camille looked at Alexander, finding his eyes already on her, warm and certain.<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s real,&quot; Alexander said, his gaze never leaving Camille&#x27;s face.<br/><br/>&quot;Yes,&quot; Camille agreed quietly. &quot;It&#x27;s real.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria nodded, as if confirming something she had already known. &quot;Then fight for it. Together.&quot; She turned back to face them. &quot;Tonight, you will attend the Hamilton Foundation Gala. Together. Arriving openly as a couple. No shame, no apologies.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille felt her heartbeat quicken. The Hamilton Gala was guaranteed to attract press and attention.<br/><br/>&quot;Before that,&quot; Victoria continued, &quot;you will hold a press conference. Together. You will confirm your relationship, explain that while it is relatively new, it is genuine. You will address the financial allegations directly, announcing that both companies will provide evidence of their falsity within twenty-four hours.&quot;<br/><br/>The strategy was bold, unexpected, classic Victoria Kane. Instead of hiding, they would meet the attack head-on, turning vulnerability into strength.<br/><br/>&quot;What about Rose and Herod?&quot; Camille asked. &quot;They won&#x27;t stop with this.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No, they won&#x27;t,&quot; Victoria agreed. &quot;But by taking control of this narrative, you buy time to identify their next move. And you deny them what they truly want, to see you fractured, separated, weakened.&quot;<br/><br/>She gathered her papers. &quot;The board meeting begins in thirty minutes. I will handle them. You two prepare for the press conference at four o&#x27;clock. That gives the evening news cycle time to pick it up before the gala.&quot;<br/><br/>As she moved toward the door, Victoria paused. &quot;One more thing. This relationship—while I don&#x27;t object to its existence, I expect it to strengthen both of you, not distract you. Rose and Herod targeted it because they believed it would divide your focus, create vulnerability. Prove them wrong.&quot;<br/><br/>With that, she left, the door closing firmly behind her.<br/><br/>For a moment, Camille and Alexander sat in silence. Then Alexander reached for Camille&#x27;s hand.<br/><br/>&quot;She&#x27;s right,&quot; he said simply.<br/><br/>&quot;About which part?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;All of it. Especially proving Rose and Herod wrong.&quot; His fingers tightened around hers. &quot;They want to use what we have against us. So instead, we use it as strength.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille looked down at their joined hands. &quot;Are you ready for this? Once we confirm our relationship publicly, there&#x27;s no going back. Every aspect of it will be scrutinized, questioned, analyzed.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ve spent my entire life in the public eye,&quot; Alexander reminded her. &quot;But this is the first time I&#x27;ve had something—someone—worth facing that scrutiny for.&quot;<br/><br/>His words warmed her, easing some of the dread that had filled her since seeing those photos. She thought of how far she had come—from a woman broken by betrayal to someone strong enough to stand tall under public scrutiny, to fight for what she valued instead of retreating.<br/><br/>&quot;A press conference, then the gala,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#x27;s going to be intense.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Good thing we&#x27;re both at our best under pressure,&quot; Alexander replied with a hint of a smile.<br/><br/>Outside the office, they could see Hannah approaching with several members of the PR team. The next few hours would be a whirlwind of preparation.<br/><br/>But for this moment, Camille allowed herself to feel not just the anger at the violation of her privacy or the worry about Kane Industries&#x27; stock price, but also the certainty that had been growing inside her since that afternoon on Alexander&#x27;s yacht.<br/><br/>Some things were worth fighting for. Some connections too valuable to sacrifice, even in the face of public scandal.<br/><br/>Rose had meant to destroy her by exposing her relationship with Alexander. Instead, she had forced Camille to acknowledge what it truly meant to her, and to defend it, openly and without shame.<br/><br/>As Hannah knocked on the door, Camille squeezed Alexander&#x27;s hand once more before letting go. &quot;Let&#x27;s show them exactly what they&#x27;re up against,&quot; she said quietly.<br/><br/>Together, they rose to meet the storm head-on.<br/></div>
