        <h1>Chapter 151-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 151<br/><br/>Jason moved silently through the service corridor, his flashlight beam sweeping across the walls and floor. Twenty years in private security had taught him to trust his instincts, and right now every nerve in his body screamed danger. When Alexander Pierce had ordered a full sweep of the building, Jason had chosen to check the basement himself.<br/><br/>&quot;East corridor clear,&quot; crackled a voice through his earpiece. <br/><br/>&quot;Copy that,&quot; Jason replied. &quot;Moving to check the electrical room.&quot;<br/><br/>The door to the electrical room was unlocked, the first red flag. Hotel policy required all maintenance rooms to be secured at all times. Jason drew his weapon before pushing the door open with his shoulder.<br/><br/>The room appeared empty at first glance. Rows of circuit breakers lined the walls. The constant hum of electricity filled the air. Jason moved his flashlight methodically across the space, checking every corner, every shadow.<br/><br/>Then he saw it.<br/><br/>Attached to the main circuit panel was a black device the size of a paperback book. A small screen displayed glowing red numbers: 15:42... 15:41... 15:40...<br/><br/>Jason&#x27;s throat went dry. He&#x27;d seen similar devices during his military days.<br/><br/>&quot;Sir,&quot; he said into his comm, voice tight. &quot;I&#x27;ve found something in the electrical room. Southeast corner, basement level. It appears to be an explosive device. Timer shows fifteen minutes and counting.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s response was immediate. &quot;Stay there. Bomb squad is on site. They&#x27;re coming to you now.&quot;<br/><br/>Jason didn&#x27;t touch the device but moved closer to examine it. The timer continued its relentless countdown. 15:22... 15:21... 15:20...<br/><br/>He could hear footsteps approaching fast, the bomb squad, he hoped. But fifteen minutes wasn&#x27;t much time to disarm a device, especially if there were others hidden throughout the building.<br/><br/>The Grand Plaza Hotel housed over eight hundred guests tonight, not counting staff. Eight hundred lives now hanging in the balance.<br/><br/>Jason had never been a religious man, but in that moment, he found himself praying.<br/><br/>*** **<br/><br/>Alexander Pierce stood at the edge of the ballroom, his face carefully blank despite the chaos erupting in his earpiece. Reports flooded in from his security team:<br/><br/>&quot;Suspicious device found in the ventilation room.&quot;<br/>&quot;Another one near the main support column in the west wing.&quot;<br/>&quot;Device located in the kitchen, attached to a gas line.&quot;<br/><br/>Six devices discovered so far. Six bombs scattered throughout the building. All with the same countdown timer.<br/><br/>Alexander checked his watch. Fourteen minutes until detonation.<br/><br/>He caught Stefan Rodriguez&#x27;s eye across the room and gave a slight nod. Stefan had been right. The threat was real. Now they needed to move eight hundred people to safety without causing a deadly panic.<br/><br/>Alexander pressed a button on his phone, sending a pre-arranged signal to the hotel manager. Within seconds, the man appeared at Alexander&#x27;s side.<br/><br/>&quot;We have a confirmed threat,&quot; Alexander said quietly. &quot;Multiple explosive devices throughout the building. We need to begin emergency evacuation immediately.&quot;<br/><br/>The manager&#x27;s face drained of color, but his voice remained steady. &quot;Understood. We&#x27;ll use the fire alarm protocol. Security will direct guests to the appropriate exits.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No alarms,&quot; Alexander countered. &quot;The sound might trigger the devices. We need a quiet evacuation.&quot;<br/><br/>The manager nodded. &quot;I&#x27;ll alert the staff. We&#x27;ll announce a power issue, ask guests to exit calmly.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Fourteen minutes,&quot; Alexander reminded him. &quot;Not a second more.&quot;<br/><br/>As the manager moved away, Alexander touched his earpiece again. &quot;Status on the bomb squad?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;They&#x27;re examining the first device now, sir,&quot; came Jason&#x27;s voice. &quot;But there&#x27;s a problem. They say it&#x27;s sophisticated, booby-trapped to detonate if tampered with. They&#x27;re not sure they can disarm all of them in time.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s stomach dropped. &quot;Understood. Continue the search. Find every device.&quot;<br/><br/>He scanned the ballroom, locating Victoria at the head table. Camille stood nearby, surrounded by admirers after her speech. Neither woman knew the danger they were in.<br/><br/>Not yet.<br/><br/>Alexander moved through the crowd with purpose, nodding politely at those who tried to engage him but never stopping. When he reached Camille, he placed a hand gently on her elbow.<br/><br/>&quot;Excuse us,&quot; he said to the group around her. &quot;I need to borrow Ms. Kane for a moment.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille&#x27;s smile remained fixed, but her eyes questioned him as he guided her toward Victoria&#x27;s table.<br/><br/>&quot;What&#x27;s wrong?&quot; she whispered.<br/><br/>&quot;Not here,&quot; Alexander replied, his voice barely audible.<br/><br/>Victoria looked up as they approached, instantly alert to the tension in Alexander&#x27;s posture.<br/><br/>&quot;We need to talk,&quot; he said. &quot;Now.&quot;<br/><br/>They moved to a quiet corner of the ballroom, Alexander positioning himself to block others&#x27; view of their faces.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;ve found explosive devices throughout the building,&quot; he said without preamble. &quot;Six so far. Timers show less than fourteen minutes until detonation. Bomb squad is on site but doesn&#x27;t believe they can disarm them all in time.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s face remained composed, though her eyes widened slightly. Camille gasped, instinctively moving closer to Victoria as if to protect her.<br/><br/>&quot;Rose,&quot; Camille whispered, her voice tight with anger and fear.<br/><br/>Alexander nodded. &quot;Most likely. We&#x27;re beginning evacuation procedures now. I need you both to leave immediately through the private exit. A car is waiting.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria straightened her spine, years of crisis management taking over. &quot;How are you handling the evacuation?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Hotel staff will announce a power issue requiring the building to be emptied. Security will guide guests to the nearest exits.&quot; Alexander checked his watch again. &quot;We have thirteen minutes.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Eight hundred people in thirteen minutes,&quot; Victoria said, calculating the odds. &quot;It will be close.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Too close,&quot; Camille murmured, scanning the crowded room. People laughing, drinking, completely unaware of the danger ticking beneath their feet.<br/><br/>The hotel manager had reached the stage now. He tapped the microphone, gaining everyone&#x27;s attention.<br/><br/>&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize for the interruption. We&#x27;ve been informed of an electrical issue that requires us to temporarily vacate the building. Please proceed calmly to the nearest exit, where our staff will direct you. This is only a precaution, but we do need to move quickly.&quot;<br/><br/>Murmurs of confusion rippled through the crowd. Some guests stood immediately, while others lingered, finishing drinks or conversations.<br/><br/>&quot;They&#x27;re not moving fast enough,&quot; Camille said, tension building in her chest.</div>
