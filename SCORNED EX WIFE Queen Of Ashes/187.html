        <h1>Chapter 123</h1>
        <div><p>Chapter 123<br/><br/>Herod stared at the monitors, his knuckles white as he gripped the edge of his desk. The data scrolling across the screens made no sense. According to every parameter, the Phoenix Grid should be showing signs of stress by now. The modified circuits James Walsh had installed were designed to create power fluctuations after seventy-two hours. That deadline had passed yesterday.<br/><br/>Yet the Grid ran perfectly.<br/><br/>He pulled up news footage of Victoria Kane&#x27;s press conference from that morning, where she proudly announced the successful activation of the Grid&#x27;s third section. Her silver hair gleamed under the lights as she promised New York &quot;the most reliable power system in the world.&quot; The reporters applauded. The stock climbed higher.<br/><br/>Something was very wrong.<br/><br/>&quot;Damn it,&quot; he muttered, slamming his palm against the desk. The coffee cup beside his keyboard jumped, spilling dark liquid across his papers.<br/><br/>Behind him, the penthouse door opened. Rose entered, carrying shopping bags from exclusive boutiques, her face flushed with the particular pleasure she took in spending his money.<br/><br/>&quot;You won&#x27;t believe what I found at Bergdorf&#x27;s,&quot; she began, then stopped when she saw his expression. &quot;What is it?&quot;<br/><br/>Herod gestured at the screens. &quot;The Grid. It&#x27;s still functioning perfectly.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose set down her bags, moving to stand behind him. &quot;Maybe it&#x27;s just delayed. The failure might still happen.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No.&quot; He pulled up the schematics Walsh had worked from. &quot;These modifications should have created visible problems within seventy-two hours. It&#x27;s been ninety-six. Nothing has happened.&quot;<br/><br/>He swiveled in his chair to face her. &quot;They found our sabotage.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s eyes narrowed. &quot;That&#x27;s impossible. Walsh had clearance. No one questioned him.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yet here we are.&quot; Herod stood, pacing the length of his office. The Manhattan skyline stretched beyond the windows, Kane Industries tower visible in the distance, mocking him with its uninterrupted power supply. &quot;They not only found it, they corrected it without alerting anyone, without changing their timeline. They wanted us to think our plan was working.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Have you spoken to Walsh?&quot; Rose asked.<br/><br/>&quot;Yes, this morning. He swears he installed everything exactly as planned.&quot; Herod&#x27;s voice tightened with frustration. &quot;He has no idea how they could have fixed it without him knowing. No one has approached him or questioned his work.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose sank into a chair, her shopping forgotten. &quot;So they somehow discovered our modifications without identifying Walsh as the source.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Exactly.&quot; Herod brought up another screen, showing Kane Industries stock price over the past week. Despite their attempts to create doubt about the Grid&#x27;s safety, despite the scandal with Camille and Alexander&#x27;s relationship, the stock had risen steadily.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;re losing,&quot; he said flatly.<br/><br/>Rose stood abruptly, her chair scraping against the floor. &quot;No. I refuse to accept that.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Accept what? Reality?&quot; Anger edged Herod&#x27;s voice. &quot;We&#x27;ve spent millions on this sabotage. And for what? To make Kane Industries stronger? To turn your sister and Pierce into New York&#x27;s favorite couple?&quot;<br/><br/>He gestured to a newspaper on his desk, the society pages open to a full-color spread of Camille and Alexander at the charity auction. The sapphire necklace gleamed against her skin as he kissed her, cameras capturing what should have been their humiliation but had somehow become their triumph.<br/><br/>&quot;They&#x27;ve outplayed us at every turn,&quot; Herod continued. &quot;The Grid sabotage, discovered and fixed. The relationship scandal, turned into a publicity coup.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose stared at the photograph, something dark and hungry in her gaze. &quot;Then we stop playing their game. We stop being subtle.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What does that mean?&quot;<br/><br/>She turned to him, her eyes glittering with dangerous intent. &quot;It means we take a more direct approach.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod felt a chill at her tone. &quot;Explain.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The Grid can&#x27;t function without its architects.&quot; Rose moved closer, her voice dropping. &quot;Victoria. Camille. The chief engineer – what&#x27;s her name? Hannah Zhao. Remove them, and the project falls apart.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod stepped back, studying her face. &quot;You&#x27;re talking about..&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m talking about solving our problem permanently.&quot; Rose placed her hand on his chest, fingers splayed across his expensive shirt. &quot;We&#x27;ve tried it your way. The financial maneuvers, the technical sabotage, the careful manipulation of public opinion. And where has it gotten us?&quot;<br/><br/>She gestured to the screens showing the Grid&#x27;s perfect performance metrics. &quot;Nowhere. It&#x27;s time for my approach.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Your approach.&quot; Herod removed her hand from his chest, holding it between them like something dangerous. &quot;You mean violence.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I mean efficiency.&quot; Rose didn&#x27;t pull away, her gaze locked with his. &quot;The Grid goes online fully next week. Victoria is scheduled to throw the switch personally at their headquarters. Everyone will be there – Victoria, Camille, Alexander, the board, the press.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod released her hand, turning away. &quot;You&#x27;re talking about an attack. In public. With casualties.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m talking about results.&quot; Rose followed him, unwilling to let him retreat. &quot;Isn&#x27;t that what you want? Kane Industries dismantled, the Grid technology in your hands, Victoria destroyed?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Not like this.&quot; Herod ran a hand through his hair, suddenly uncertain. When had this escalated so far? &quot;I wanted to acquire the company legitimately, through stock purchases and board pressure. Business, not bloodshed.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose laughed, the sound sharp enough to cut. &quot;Legitimately? After everything we&#x27;ve done? The sabotage, the leaked photos, the fabricated evidence? There&#x27;s nothing legitimate about any of this.&quot;<br/><br/>She was right, and they both knew it. They had crossed lines already, legal and ethical. But this... this was different.<br/><br/>&quot;Rose,&quot; he began, choosing his words carefully. &quot;Your hatred for Camille is clouding your judgment.&quot;<br/><br/>Her expression hardened. &quot;My hatred for Camille is the reason we&#x27;re here. Don&#x27;t pretend your hands are clean, Herod. Not after everything you&#x27;ve done.&quot;<br/><br/>Tension stretched between them, the easy intimacy of recent weeks suddenly strained. For the first time, Herod saw clearly the darkness that drove Rose, the bottomless well of resentment that no amount of revenge could fill.<br/><br/>&quot;This isn&#x27;t what I signed up for,&quot; he said finally.<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s eyes narrowed. &quot;It&#x27;s exactly what you signed up for. Destruction of Victoria Kane, the woman who ruined your family. You just didn&#x27;t want to acknowledge the cost.&quot;<br/><br/>She moved to the window, her silhouette sharp against the city lights. &quot;If you&#x27;re having second thoughts, say so now. I can find other partners.&quot;<br/><br/>The threat hung in the air between them. Herod studied her profile, this woman who had become his lover and his co-conspirator. He had known she was dangerous when they&#x27;d begun this. Her ruthlessness had been an asset. Now he wondered if it might become his downfall.<br/><br/>&quot;What exactly are you proposing?&quot; he asked, his voice careful.<br/><br/>Rose turned, a smile curving her lips. She sensed his weakening resolve. &quot;Nothing complicated. A simple disruption during the activation ceremony. Something that requires evacuation, creates confusion. During that chaos, we eliminate the key players.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod moved to the bar, pouring himself a drink with unsteady hands. &quot;And you think no one will connect this back to us?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Not with proper planning.&quot; Rose followed, taking the glass from his hand and sipping from it herself. &quot;I have contacts from my previous life. People who can arrange things discreetly, for the right price.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod watched her drink from his glass, her lipstick leaving a scarlet mark on the rim. When had she become this person? Or had she always been this person, and he simply hadn&#x27;t wanted to see it?<br/><br/>&quot;This is a significant escalation,&quot; he said carefully.<br/><br/>Rose set down the glass, moving closer until her body pressed against his. &quot;Don&#x27;t overthink this, Herod. We want the same things. We&#x27;re just discussing methods.&quot;<br/><br/>Her fingers traced the line of his jaw, her touch both seductive and threatening. &quot;You were willing to destroy lives through financial ruin. Is this really so different?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said simply. &quot;It is.&quot;<br/><br/>Something cold flashed in her eyes, there and gone in an instant. Then she smiled, her expression softening. &quot;Of course it is. I understand your hesitation. Take your time.&quot;<br/><br/>She kissed him lightly, her lips barely brushing his. &quot;Just don&#x27;t think too long. Our window of opportunity closes after the Grid activation.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose stepped away, retrieving her shopping bags as if the conversation had never happened. &quot;I&#x27;m going to try on my new dresses. Join me if you&#x27;d like.&quot;<br/><br/>She disappeared into the bedroom, leaving Herod alone with his troubled thoughts and the evidence of their failed sabotage still displayed across the monitors.<br/><br/>For the first time since their alliance began, he wondered if their goals were truly aligned. If her vendetta against Camille might ultimately destroy not just the Kane women, but him as well.</p></div>
