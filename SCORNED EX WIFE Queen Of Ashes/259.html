        <h1>Chapter 166-2</h1>
        <div><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s a three-hour drive to the location,&quot; Alexander explained, his voice tight with controlled urgency. &quot;The helicopter gets us there in under an hour. We need time to prep the team, coordinate with local authorities, and develop an approach strategy.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria placed a hand on Richard&#x27;s arm. &quot;He&#x27;s right. We can&#x27;t rush in without a plan. Rose will be expecting us.&quot;<br/><br/>As the room erupted into coordinated activity, Alexander stepped away briefly, staring out the window at the darkening sky. Thirty-five hours since Rose had taken Camille. Thirty-five hours of her in Rose&#x27;s hands.<br/><br/>He felt Stefan&#x27;s presence before the man spoke.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;ll find her,&quot; Stefan said quietly. &quot;Rose won&#x27;t kill her quickly. That&#x27;s not what she wants.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And what does she want?&quot; Alexander asked, not turning around.<br/><br/>&quot;To make Camille suffer. To break her. To make her watch as Rose destroys everything she loves.&quot; Stefan&#x27;s voice was hollow with the weight of his knowledge. &quot;She wants Camille to feel as alone and abandoned as she felt when the family turned against her.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander finally turned, studying the man who had once been married to Camille, who had betrayed her with Rose. &quot;You knew what Rose was. What she&#x27;s capable of. And you still chose her over Camille.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan flinched as if struck. &quot;I was blind. Manipulated. I didn&#x27;t see who Rose really was until it was too late.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And now Camille is paying for your blindness.&quot; The words came out sharper than Alexander intended, driven by fear and exhaustion.<br/><br/>Stefan didn&#x27;t defend himself. &quot;Yes. That&#x27;s why I have to help find her. Why I have to make this right.&quot;<br/><br/>A heavy silence fell between them, broken only when Victoria called them back to the tactical planning.<br/><br/>The FBI team reported in again as they prepared to depart. The Catskills property had been another dead end, empty except for a laptop playing a continuous video feed of the cabin in the Adirondacks. Rose had been watching them chase false leads all along.<br/><br/>&quot;She&#x27;s playing a game,&quot; Agent Chen said through the speakerphone. &quot;Leading us exactly where she wants us to go.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Then we change the rules,&quot; Alexander replied. &quot;Radio silence from this point forward. We go dark.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria nodded approval. &quot;If she&#x27;s monitoring our communications, she won&#x27;t know we&#x27;re coming.&quot;<br/><br/>As they moved toward the helipad on the roof, Richard Lewis pulled Alexander aside.<br/><br/>&quot;Bring my daughter home,&quot; he said, his voice breaking. &quot;Please.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander clasped the older man&#x27;s shoulder. &quot;I will. Whatever it takes.&quot;<br/><br/>The helicopter flight passed in tense silence. Alexander reviewed the tactical plan on his tablet, while Stefan stared out the window at the darkening landscape below. Victoria sat with her eyes closed, gathering her strength for what was to come.<br/><br/>They landed three miles from the cabin, in a clearing scouted by Alexander&#x27;s advance team. Vehicles waited to transport them the rest of the way.<br/><br/>&quot;Thermal imaging shows five heat signatures in the cabin,&quot; the team leader reported as they gathered around a portable display. &quot;Four moving, one stationary in what appears to be the main room.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Camille,&quot; Alexander murmured, staring at the glowing figure on the screen.<br/><br/>&quot;Rose and three others,&quot; Stefan added. &quot;Hired muscle, most likely.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander turned to the assembled team, his own security personnel plus FBI tactical units who had arrived from the nearest field office. &quot;We move in quiet. Two teams. Alpha team creates a diversion at the rear of the property. Beta team enters through the front and extracts Camille. No one engages Rose unless absolutely necessary.&quot;<br/><br/>The team leaders nodded, distributing night vision equipment and tactical gear.<br/><br/>&quot;What about me?&quot; Victoria asked quietly.<br/><br/>Alexander had expected this question. &quot;You stay in the command vehicle with Agent Chen. We&#x27;ll be on comms the entire time.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria looked ready to argue but then nodded, understanding the logic.<br/><br/>Stefan checked the bulletproof vest Alexander had insisted he wear. &quot;And me?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You&#x27;re with me,&quot; Alexander said after a moment&#x27;s hesitation. &quot;You know Rose. You&#x27;ll recognize any traps she might have set.&quot;<br/><br/>As the teams moved into position, darkness finally falling completely over the forest, Alexander felt time slowing around him. Every second stretched into an eternity, knowing Camille was so close yet still in danger.<br/><br/>The command came through his earpiece. &quot;Teams in position.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander gave the signal. &quot;Execute.&quot;<br/><br/>Ahead in the darkness, the cabin&#x27;s windows glowed with warm light, a deceptively peaceful scene in the middle of the forest. From this distance, no one would guess the nightmare unfolding inside.<br/><br/>Alexander moved forward with his team, every sense hyper-alert, every muscle tense. So close now. So close to Camille.<br/><br/>Then a sound cut through the night, an alarm blaring from the cabin. Lights suddenly flooded the surrounding forest, illuminating the approaching teams.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;ve been made!&quot; someone shouted through the comms. &quot;Motion sensors in the trees!&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander cursed, abandoning stealth for speed. &quot;Move in! Now!&quot;<br/><br/>Gunfire erupted from the cabin windows. Alexander&#x27;s team took cover behind trees and rocks, returning fire with precise bursts.<br/><br/>Through his earpiece, he heard Victoria&#x27;s voice from the command vehicle. &quot;Alexander! The thermal signatures are changing. They&#x27;re moving Camille!&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan crouched beside him behind a fallen log. &quot;Rose would have an escape route. A contingency plan.&quot;<br/><br/>Before Alexander could respond, an explosion rocked the night, flames erupting from the rear of the cabin where Alpha team had been positioned.<br/><br/>&quot;Alpha team report!&quot; Alexander shouted into his comm.<br/><br/>Static answered him, then broken voices. &quot;Trap... booby-trapped... two men down...&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander made a split-second decision. &quot;Beta team, with me. Front entrance, now!&quot;<br/><br/>They rushed the cabin, bullets splintering wood around them. Alexander kicked in the front door, gun raised.<br/><br/>The main room stood empty except for an overturned chair with cut ropes lying beside it.<br/><br/>Empty.<br/><br/>Camille was gone.<br/></div>
