        <h1>Chapter 119-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 119<br/><br/>The Kane Industries executive suite had transformed into a war room. Phones rang without pause. Screens displayed financial tickers bleeding red. In the center of the chaos stood Camille, her face a mask of calm.<br/><br/>&quot;They&#x27;re calling from everywhere,&quot; Hannah said, covering her phone. &quot;Forbes, CNN, MSNBC. They all want a statement about the photos.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille stared at the largest screen showing the New York Spectator&#x27;s website with her and Alexander&#x27;s private moment splashed across it. Their embrace on his yacht, now public property.<br/><br/>&quot;Who leaked these?&quot; she asked, her voice controlled despite the violation she felt.<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;re working on it,&quot; said Michael Chen, head of security. &quot;The metadata suggests they were taken three days ago on Mr. Pierce&#x27;s yacht.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille&#x27;s fingers tightened around her coffee cup. Three days ago. The afternoon she had allowed herself a few hours of peace. The first time she had felt truly alive since Victoria&#x27;s collapse.<br/><br/>Her phone buzzed. Alexander.<br/><br/>*I&#x27;m downstairs. Security won&#x27;t let me up.*<br/><br/>She texted back: *Coming down.*<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ll be back in five minutes,&quot; she told Hannah. &quot;Keep monitoring the stock situation.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s still falling,&quot; Hannah warned. &quot;Down twenty-three points since the photos hit, and the financial allegations aren&#x27;t helping.&quot;<br/><br/>The fabricated documents suggesting Alexander had pursued her for insider information had emerged just as the photo scandal peaked. A perfect one-two punch designed to destroy her reputation and their relationship.<br/><br/>Camille rode the private elevator down. When the doors opened, she spotted Alexander immediately.<br/><br/>&quot;This way,&quot; she said, leading him to another elevator requiring her thumbprint. Once inside, away from prying eyes, her guard dropped slightly.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m sorry,&quot; Alexander said immediately. &quot;I should have been more careful. My security team is trying to determine...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It wasn&#x27;t your fault,&quot; Camille interrupted. &quot;It was a targeted attack. The timing, the financial &#x27;revelations&#x27; emerging right after the photos, this was planned.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s face darkened. &quot;Rose and Herod.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded. &quot;Who else would benefit from discrediting us both simultaneously?&quot;<br/><br/>The elevator opened directly into Victoria&#x27;s office, now temporarily Camille&#x27;s.<br/><br/>&quot;The board is meeting in an hour,&quot; Camille said. &quot;Several members have already called for my resignation.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Based on what? That you have a personal life?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Based on the suggestion that my personal life creates a conflict of interest.&quot; She gestured to a tablet. &quot;These documents they&#x27;re circulating, they&#x27;re fake, but convincing. Emails showing you pursued me for information about Kane Industries. Records suggesting you&#x27;ve been buying our stock through proxies.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander scanned the article with growing anger. &quot;These emails never existed. I can prove it.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;By the time we prove it, the damage will be done.&quot; Camille turned toward the window. &quot;They&#x27;re trying to force a crisis of confidence. If the stock falls far enough, Herod can move to acquire controlling interest.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I won&#x27;t let that happen,&quot; Alexander said firmly.<br/><br/>Camille turned back to him. &quot;We need to be strategic. The board will want to separate us publicly to stabilize the stock price.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander stepped closer. &quot;And what do you want?&quot;<br/><br/>The question hung between them. What did she want? For months, her focus had been on revenge, then on Victoria&#x27;s recovery, then on proving herself worthy. Her own desires had seemed irrelevant.<br/><br/>Until Alexander. Until that afternoon when she had allowed herself to want something beyond victory.<br/><br/>&quot;I want...&quot; she began, then stopped as the door opened.<br/><br/>Victoria Kane stood in the doorway.<br/><br/>Camille froze. Victoria should still be at home recovering. The surgery had been successful, but her doctors had recommended another week of rest.<br/><br/>&quot;Victoria,&quot; she said, moving forward. &quot;You shouldn&#x27;t be here.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria waved away her concern, walking in with only the slightest stiffness. Despite her recent surgery, she radiated authority, dressed impeccably in a charcoal suit.<br/><br/>&quot;I go where I&#x27;m needed,&quot; she said simply. &quot;And clearly, I&#x27;m needed here.&quot;<br/><br/>She crossed to her desk, setting down a small leather portfolio. Her gaze traveled from Camille to Alexander, assessing them both.<br/><br/>&quot;So,&quot; she said finally. &quot;This is our crisis.&quot;<br/><br/>She gestured to the New York Spectator website still displayed.<br/><br/>&quot;Yes,&quot; Camille acknowledged, bracing for disappointment or anger.<br/><br/>Instead, Victoria nodded thoughtfully. &quot;Sit down, both of you. We don&#x27;t have much time before the board meeting.&quot;<br/><br/>They obeyed, taking chairs across from Victoria.<br/><br/>&quot;The photos are real,&quot; Victoria stated. Not a question.<br/><br/>&quot;Yes,&quot; Camille confirmed. &quot;Taken without our knowledge three days ago.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And the financial documents? The emails?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Fabricated,&quot; Alexander answered firmly. &quot;I can prove it if given time.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria nodded. &quot;Time is precisely what Rose and Herod are trying to deny us. A classic strategy, create a crisis, then exploit the chaos while everyone is scrambling to respond.&quot;<br/><br/>She opened her portfolio. &quot;Our stock has fallen twenty-six points since the story broke. Trading was temporarily halted, but has resumed with continued decline.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The board wants me to step down,&quot; Camille said quietly.<br/><br/>&quot;Of course they do,&quot; Victoria replied, unsurprised. &quot;They&#x27;re panicking, looking for the easiest way to stop the bleeding.&quot;<br/><br/>She turned to Alexander. &quot;And you? What does your board think of this... entanglement?&quot;</div>
