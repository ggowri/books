        <h1>Chapter 88-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 88<br/><br/>The executive boardroom of Kane Industries fell silent as Victoria Kane entered, Camille following close behind. Ten pairs of eyes tracked their movement, calculating and wary. The morning sunlight streaming through the windows did nothing to warm the atmosphere.<br/><br/>Victoria took her place at the head of the table. Camille sat to her right, feeling the weight of scrutiny press down on her shoulders. She had dressed with particular care that morning—a structured navy suit, minimal jewelry, hair pulled back severely. The outfit of a serious businesswoman, not an unstable heiress.<br/><br/>James Whitley, the longest-serving board member, cleared his throat. &quot;Thank you for meeting on such short notice. Given the extraordinary circumstances, we felt immediate discussion was necessary.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s face remained impassive. &quot;The circumstances being?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Don&#x27;t play games, Victoria,&quot; snapped Eleanor Price from across the table. The former federal judge had always maintained professional distance. Today, that distance had turned to frost. &quot;Our stock dropped twenty-two percent before trading was halted. The market reopens in three hours. We need answers now.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The allegations against Camille are false,&quot; Victoria said, her voice measured but firm. &quot;A coordinated attack designed to damage Kane Industries through character assassination.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That may be,&quot; said Michael Chen, the soft-spoken CFO. &quot;But market perception is our current reality. Investors are fleeing. Partners are calling with concerns. Three major clients have already requested meetings to discuss &#x27;continuity of leadership.&#x27;&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The Phoenix Grid launch is two weeks away,&quot; added Diane Rodriguez. &quot;We&#x27;ve invested billions. If confidence in the technology collapses along with confidence in...&quot; She hesitated, eyes sliding to Camille. &quot;In leadership, we face an existential threat.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille kept her expression neutral. She had prepared for this, rehearsed with Victoria until dawn. Show strength. Show control. Any display of emotion would only reinforce the narrative they were fighting against.<br/><br/>&quot;The Phoenix Grid technology is sound,&quot; Camille said, speaking for the first time. &quot;The engineering team has verified every aspect. We have redundant testing protocols precisely to prevent any single point of failure.&quot;<br/><br/>Whitley&#x27;s eyes narrowed. &quot;That&#x27;s not the concern, Ms. Kane. The concern is whether your... personal situation has compromised your judgment regarding the project.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;My personal situation?&quot; Camille felt her control slip slightly. &quot;You mean the lies being spread about me?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Regarding those allegations,&quot; said Eleanor, shuffling papers. &quot;These supposed medical records...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Are fabricated,&quot; Victoria cut in. &quot;Obviously.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Are they? Because their specificity is concerning.&quot; Eleanor read from a document. &quot;Treatment for paranoid delusions at age sixteen. Hospitalization following a violent episode during college. Ongoing therapy for persecution complex. These are detailed claims.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;False claims,&quot; Victoria said, her knuckles whitening around her pen.<br/><br/>&quot;Then why haven&#x27;t you sued for defamation?&quot; This from Thomas Gordon, the newest board member. &quot;The company&#x27;s standard response to false reporting has always been immediate legal action.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s eyes flashed. &quot;We are gathering evidence on the source of these fabrications before filing. Strategic patience is not inaction.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What about the interview with Rose Lewis?&quot; Diane pressed. &quot;She made specific claims about witnessing unstable behavior. And now the parents are scheduled to speak tomorrow.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille felt the blood drain from her face. She hadn&#x27;t known about her parents&#x27; interview until this moment.<br/><br/>&quot;Rose Lewis is a proven liar,&quot; Victoria said flatly. &quot;The woman orchestrated an attempt on Camille&#x27;s life. Her credibility is non-existent.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The public doesn&#x27;t seem to agree,&quot; said Michael, sliding a tablet toward the center. &quot;Social media sentiment analysis shows 68% of public response favors Rose&#x27;s version of events.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;re not running this company based on Twitter polls,&quot; Victoria said, her tone sharp.<br/><br/>&quot;No, we run it based on market value and shareholder confidence,&quot; Eleanor countered. &quot;Both of which are in freefall.&quot;<br/><br/>A heavy silence descended. Camille heard the soft hum of the air conditioning, the muted sounds of the city below.<br/><br/>&quot;What exactly are you suggesting?&quot; Victoria finally asked, though her tightness around her eyes suggested she already knew.<br/><br/>James Whitley exchanged glances with the other board members. &quot;The board believes it would be in the company&#x27;s best interest if Camille stepped back from her role until this situation resolves.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Steps back?&quot; Victoria&#x27;s voice remained calm, but Camille saw the tiny muscle jump in her jaw.<br/><br/>&quot;Temporarily removes herself from all public-facing duties,&quot; Whitley clarified. &quot;No Phoenix Grid launch appearance. No investor meetings. No press. A leave of absence, effective immediately.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And if we refuse this suggestion?&quot; Victoria asked.</div>
