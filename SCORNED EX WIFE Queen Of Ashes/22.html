        <h1>Chapter 18-2</h1>
        <div><br/>With that parting shot, she left the dining room, her footsteps unsteady on the stairs. Dad and I sat in stunned silence for several long moments.<br/><br/>&quot;She doesn&#x27;t mean it,&quot; he finally said, running a hand through his thinning hair. &quot;Grief makes people irrational. She&#x27;ll come around.&quot;<br/><br/>But we both knew she wouldn&#x27;t. The seed of doubt had been planted, and now it was growing, fed by newspaper articles and missing bodies and mysterious journal entries.<br/><br/>I left shortly after, pleading work commitments. In the car, I finally allowed myself to drop the mask, anxiety crawling across my skin like ants. This was bad. Worse than I&#x27;d anticipated.<br/><br/>Mom&#x27;s suspicions. The journals. The private investigator.<br/><br/>Even Stefan might turn against me if he learned the full truth. He&#x27;d been increasingly distant these past weeks, withdrawing into grief and guilt over the divorce papers he&#x27;d signed the day before Camille disappeared. The poor fool actually believed he might have contributed to her &quot;suicide&quot; by ending their marriage.<br/><br/>I&#x27;d carefully nurtured that belief, of course. Better he blame himself than look too closely at me. Better everyone think Camille had been driven to desperation by her failing marriage than suspect I&#x27;d arranged for men to frighten her that night, a plan that had gone terribly wrong when they took things too far.<br/><br/>I poured myself a drink as soon as I entered my apartment, mind racing through contingencies. First priority: find those journals and see exactly what Camille had written. Second: ensure my mother&#x27;s private investigator discovered nothing but evidence supporting the accident theory.<br/><br/>And if that didn&#x27;t work? A chill ran through me, not fear, but cold determination. When I faced myself in the mirror, my expression was steady, certain.<br/><br/>Then I&#x27;d create a new narrative. One where my grief-stricken mother, unable to accept the tragic loss of her daughter, became obsessed with conspiracy theories and wild accusations.<br/><br/>Yes, I&#x27;d discredit my own mother if necessary. I&#x27;d do whatever it took to protect what I&#x27;d built.<br/><br/>Tomorrow I would identify the shoe they found, with appropriate sisterly emotion. Then I&#x27;d visit Mom, see if I could locate those journals. The situation was still manageable, still within my control.<br/><br/>Even Stefan, unwittingly useful in my plans, would continue playing his part, the grieving ex-husband who&#x27;d found comfort with his wife&#x27;s sister after an appropriate mourning period. He had no idea how I&#x27;d orchestrated everything, from the beginning of their relationship to its tragic end.<br/><br/>Men like Stefan were so easy to manipulate. So eager to believe what you wanted them to believe. So desperate to be loved that they never questioned the convenient timing of your affections.<br/><br/>If those journals contained what I feared, Camille&#x27;s observations of my manipulations, her documentation of our conflicts, her growing suspicions about my intentions, they could provide exactly the motive police would look for if the case reopened.<br/><br/>And reopening the case was precisely what my mother seemed determined to achieve.<br/><br/>The direct approach confronting Mom, demanding the journals, would only confirm her suspicions. Searching her house while they slept risked discovery. Having them stolen would raise obvious questions.<br/><br/>No, I needed something subtler. A way to discredit the journals if they surfaced, or better yet, ensure they never did.<br/><br/>By the time I reached my apartment, a plan was forming. Mom&#x27;s drinking had increased steadily since Camille&#x27;s disappearance. Her behavior was becoming erratic, her accusations more pointed. With the right nudge, I could push her from grieving mother to unstable conspiracy theorist in the eyes of everyone who mattered.<br/><br/>Entering my apartment, I kicked off my heels and poured a glass of wine. Tomorrow would begin with identifying a waterlogged shoe, continuing my performance as the dutiful, grieving sister. But behind that mask, calculations would continue.<br/><br/>I&#x27;d come too far to be derailed now. My fashion line was taking off. My place in society was secured. The family fortune would eventually be mine alone. Everything was proceeding according to plan, despite these unexpected complications.<br/><br/>As I prepared for bed, my phone pinged with a news alert. I opened it, expecting more questions about Camille&#x27;s case.<br/><br/>Instead, the headline made my blood freeze.<br/><br/>**RECLUSIVE HEIRESS REVEALED: VICTORIA KANE INTRODUCES ADOPTED DAUGHTER AS COMPANY SUCCESSOR**<br/><br/>Beneath it, a photo showed Victoria Kane, tech Trillionaire, ruthless business titan, notorious recluse, standing beside a striking young woman with sharp cheekbones and penetrating eyes. The caption identified her as Camille Kane, Victoria&#x27;s adopted daughter, newly introduced to society after years of private education abroad.<br/><br/>Something about the woman&#x27;s face tickled at my memory. Something familiar in the eyes, the stance, the subtle tilt of her chin. But different enough that I couldn&#x27;t place it.<br/><br/>The article detailed how this mysterious Camille Kane had been adopted as a child, educated at elite European schools, and was now stepping into the spotlight as Victoria&#x27;s heir apparent. A business prodigy with degrees from Stanford and Harvard, now taking the reins of a corporate empire.<br/><br/>I skimmed the piece, irritated by the distraction. Some rich woman&#x27;s pet project had no bearing on my current problems. I closed the article and set my phone aside, returning to more pressing concerns.<br/><br/>The shoe. The journals. My mother&#x27;s suspicions. Stefan&#x27;s weakness. All issues requiring immediate attention.<br/><br/>Yet as I drifted toward sleep, the image of Camille Kane&#x27;s face floated in my mind. Those eyes. Where had I seen eyes like that before? Something about them unsettled me deeply, though I couldn&#x27;t say why.<br/><br/>A problem for another day. Tonight, I needed rest before tomorrow&#x27;s performance at the police station. The grieving sister, identifying a shoe that might have belonged to her beloved Camille. A heartrending scene in the ongoing tragedy.<br/><br/>The show must go on. At least until I could ensure the final curtain fell exactly where and how I wanted it to.<br/></div>
