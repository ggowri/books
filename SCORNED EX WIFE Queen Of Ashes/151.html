        <h1>Chapter 103-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 103<br/><br/>&quot;Where are we going?&quot; Camille asked, watching unfamiliar scenery pass outside the car window. Trees replaced skyscrapers, suburban neighborhoods gave way to scattered houses with actual yards, nothing like the Manhattan world she&#x27;d grown accustomed to.<br/><br/>Alexander kept his eyes on the road, his hands steady on the wheel of the vintage Jaguar he&#x27;d insisted on driving himself. No drivers today, no security detail, just the two of them, heading somewhere he wouldn&#x27;t name.<br/><br/>&quot;You&#x27;ll see,&quot; he said, the hint of mystery in his voice matched by the tension in his jaw.<br/><br/>For three days straight, they had worked alongside Hannah and Victoria, checking and rechecking every aspect of the Phoenix Grid for further sabotage. They had found nothing beyond those initial blueprint modifications, but the strain had worn on them all. This morning, Alexander had appeared at Camille&#x27;s door, asking her to trust him for a few hours.<br/><br/>The car slowed as they turned onto a narrow road lined with maple trees. Houses here sat far apart, imposing estates hidden behind wrought iron gates and manicured hedges. Wealth on display, generations of it.<br/><br/>&quot;Did you grow up around here?&quot; she asked, noticing how his knuckles whitened slightly on the steering wheel.<br/><br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; Just one word, but loaded with emotion.<br/><br/>They rounded a final curve, and Alexander pulled to a stop in front of massive iron gates. Beyond them, Camille could see a long driveway leading to what appeared to be a mansion.<br/><br/>&quot;Pierce Estate,&quot; Alexander said, his voice flat. &quot;Where I grew up. Or more accurately, where I survived until I could escape.&quot;<br/><br/>He didn&#x27;t make any move to open the gates, simply staring at them with an unreadable expression.<br/><br/>&quot;You still own it?&quot; Camille asked.<br/><br/>&quot;No. My parents sold it after I cut them off completely. New money tech family bought it.&quot; Alexander&#x27;s mouth twisted into something that wasn&#x27;t quite a smile. &quot;But I wanted you to see it. To understand where I came from, before I show you where I went.&quot;<br/><br/>He put the car in reverse, backed away from the gates, and continued down the road. After several minutes of silence, he spoke again.<br/><br/>&quot;The Pierces go back five generations in New York finance. Old money, very established. Appearances were everything.&quot; His voice carried a bitterness she&#x27;d never heard before. &quot;I was the second son. The spare. My brother Thomas was the golden child, perfect grades, perfect manners, Harvard-bound. Everything my father wanted.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille watched his profile, seeing emotion flicker across his normally controlled features.<br/><br/>&quot;And you?&quot; she prompted gently.<br/><br/>&quot;I was... difficult. Creative. Asked too many questions. Wanted to build things instead of just moving money around.&quot; Alexander&#x27;s mouth quirked. &quot;The black sheep. The disappointment.&quot;<br/><br/>He turned the car onto another road, this one leading away from the estates toward a more modest neighborhood. &quot;When I was seventeen, Thomas and I were driving home from a party. He&#x27;d been drinking, not much, but enough. He insisted on driving anyway.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s hands tightened on the wheel. &quot;We crashed. Thomas walked away with barely a scratch. I was in the hospital for months. Three surgeries. Physical therapy for a year after.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille felt sick imagining it. &quot;Your family...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Closed ranks around Thomas. Made sure no one knew he&#x27;d been drinking. Paid off witnesses.&quot; Alexander&#x27;s voice hardened. &quot;My father made it clear that the family reputation was more important than anything, including the truth. I was expected to go along with the story they created. To protect Thomas.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s horrible,&quot; Camille whispered.<br/><br/>&quot;It was clarifying,&quot; Alexander corrected. &quot;I saw my family for what they really were. The moment I could walk well enough, I left. Took the trust fund money they couldn&#x27;t legally keep from me and disappeared.&quot;<br/><br/>He pulled the car to a stop in front of a small brick apartment building. Nothing special, just one of thousands of such buildings in Boston.<br/><br/>&quot;I came to Boston. Rented an apartment in this building. Started over.&quot; He nodded toward the building. &quot;I was determined to make it on my own, to build something my own way. Got a job on the loading docks at Atlantic Shipping. Minimum wage. But I studied every aspect of the business. And at night, I taught myself programming, finance, business strategy.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille tried to picture Alexander, now one of the world&#x27;s wealthiest men, living in that ordinary building, working on a loading dock.<br/><br/>&quot;And then came the second accident,&quot; Alexander continued, his expression changing. &quot;The one where our paths first crossed.&quot;<br/><br/>He reached into his pocket and removed something small and silver. When he opened his palm, Camille saw the delicate rose pendant on a thin chain, the one she had given him years ago, the one he had returned to her that night he first mentioned their connection.<br/><br/>&quot;You kept it all this time?&quot; she asked, though she already knew the answer.<br/><br/>&quot;It was my talisman,&quot; Alexander said quietly. &quot;When things got hard... and they did, many times, I&#x27;d hold it and remember that someone had once seen value in me when I couldn&#x27;t see it in myself.&quot;<br/><br/>He started the car again, driving a few blocks to a sleek office building with &quot;Pierce Technologies&quot; emblazoned on the side.<br/><br/>&quot;I built my first company here. Developed shipping logistics software that revolutionized the industry. By twenty-three, I was a Billionaire. By twenty six, a Trillionaire.&quot; His voice remained matter-of-fact, without boasting. &quot;And when I crossed into trillionaire territory three years ago, guess who suddenly wanted to reconnect?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Your family,&quot; Camille said.<br/><br/>&quot;My parents, yes. Thomas had died by then, ironically in another car accident, this time with no one to blame but himself.&quot; A shadow crossed Alexander&#x27;s face. &quot;They reached out through lawyers first. Then directly. Wanted to &#x27;heal the family rift,&#x27; they said.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What did you do?&quot; Camille asked.<br/><br/>&quot;I cut them off completely. Told them in no uncertain terms that they had no son, just as I had no parents.&quot; His voice was steady, but Camille could hear the old pain beneath the words. &quot;Family isn&#x27;t just blood, Camille. It&#x27;s how people treat you when you have nothing to offer them.&quot;<br/><br/>The words resonated deeply with her, thinking of how easily her parents had sided with Rose, how quickly Stefan had betrayed her.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ve wanted to tell you all this for so long,&quot; Alexander said, turning to face her fully. &quot;From the moment I recognized you at that charity gala, I&#x27;ve wanted to explain everything. But I was afraid.&quot;</div>
