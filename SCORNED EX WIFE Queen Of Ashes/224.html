        <h1>Chapter 146-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 146<br/><br/>Pain came first. A deep, burning ache in his chest that seemed to pulse with each heartbeat. Then sounds filtered in, the steady beep of machines, the squeak of rubber-soled shoes on linoleum, hushed voices just beyond his reach.<br/><br/>Herod Preston opened his eyes.<br/><br/>The hospital room swam into focus slowly. White ceiling. Blue curtains. Clear tubes running into his arms. And a man in a dark suit sitting beside his bed, watching him with tired eyes.<br/><br/>&quot;Mr. Preston,&quot; the man said, leaning forward. &quot;I&#x27;m Special Agent Morgan with the FBI. Can you hear me?&quot;<br/><br/>Herod tried to speak, but his throat felt like sandpaper. A nurse appeared, holding a small cup of water with a straw. He sipped, the cool liquid both painful and soothing as it went down.<br/><br/>&quot;Yes,&quot; he managed finally, his voice a raspy whisper. &quot;I hear you.&quot;<br/><br/>Agent Morgan nodded to someone Herod couldn&#x27;t see. A woman stepped into view, also in a dark suit. &quot;Agent Chen,&quot; she introduced herself. &quot;You&#x27;ve been unconscious for four days, Mr. Preston. Do you remember what happened?&quot;<br/><br/>The memories hit him like a physical blow. The motel room. The phone call to the FBI. Rose&#x27;s face when she realized what he was doing. The sound of gunshots. The burning pain in his chest.<br/><br/>&quot;Rose,&quot; he said. &quot;Rose shot me.&quot;<br/><br/>The agents exchanged glances. &quot;Rose Lewis,&quot; Agent Morgan confirmed. &quot;We&#x27;ve been looking for her, but she&#x27;s disappeared.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod closed his eyes briefly, gathering his strength. Each word cost him, but he needed to speak. Needed to finally tell the truth.<br/><br/>&quot;She was behind everything,&quot; he said, each word careful and deliberate. &quot;The bombings. The sabotage. All of it.&quot;<br/><br/>Agent Chen pulled out a recorder. &quot;Mr. Preston, would you be willing to make an official statement? You have the right to have an attorney present.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No attorney,&quot; Herod said. &quot;I want to talk now. Before...&quot; He didn&#x27;t finish the thought. Before Rose could silence him permanently. Before he lost his courage.<br/><br/>Agent Morgan turned on the recorder, stating the date, time, and those present. Then he nodded to Herod. &quot;Tell us what happened, from the beginning.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod took another sip of water, organizing his thoughts. The beginning. Where was the beginning? With his family&#x27;s downfall at Victoria Kane&#x27;s hands? With his first meeting with Rose? With the moment he realized she was using him?<br/><br/>&quot;I met Rose Lewis six months ago,&quot; he started. &quot;She knew about my hatred for Victoria Kane. She used that. Encouraged it. Made me believe we were partners with the same goal, revenge against the Kanes.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And were you?&quot; Agent Chen asked. &quot;Partners?&quot;<br/><br/>Herod gave a small, bitter laugh that turned into a wince of pain. &quot;No. I was a tool. A convenient scapegoat with resources she needed.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Resources for what?&quot; Morgan pressed.<br/><br/>&quot;Money. Connections. A name that gave her access to places she couldn&#x27;t go on her own.&quot; Herod&#x27;s voice grew stronger as he spoke, as if the words themselves were giving him energy. &quot;Rose planned everything. The attacks on the Phoenix Grid. The sabotage attempts. The bombings.&quot;<br/><br/>Chen leaned forward. &quot;Are you saying Rose Lewis planted the bombs herself?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; Herod met her eyes. &quot;She had training—I never asked where she learned it. She planted both devices. Made sure my fingerprints were on components. My DNA at the scenes. All while establishing alibis for herself.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And you?&quot; Morgan asked. &quot;Where were you during the bombings?&quot;<br/><br/>Herod looked down at his bandaged chest. &quot;I knew about them. I provided money. Equipment. I helped her plan the damage to maximize impact while minimizing casualties.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;But you didn&#x27;t plant the bombs yourself?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No.&quot; The admission brought no relief, no absolution. &quot;But I didn&#x27;t stop her either. That makes me guilty too.&quot;<br/><br/>Agent Chen made notes on a small pad. &quot;Mr. Preston, do you have any proof of what you&#x27;re telling us? Any evidence that Rose Lewis was directly involved in the bombings?&quot;<br/><br/>Herod had been waiting for this question. &quot;The recorder,&quot; he said. &quot;The one I mentioned when I called you. Did you find it?&quot;<br/><br/>The agents exchanged glances again. &quot;No recorder was found at the scene,&quot; Morgan said carefully.<br/><br/>Herod closed his eyes, thinking. The recorder had been in his jacket pocket when Rose shot him. If the FBI didn&#x27;t have it, where was it?<br/><br/>&quot;Check the jacket I was wearing,&quot; he said. &quot;Inside pocket. Or maybe it fell out when I was shot.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We&#x27;ve been through your clothing, Mr. Preston,&quot; Chen said. &quot;There was no recording device.&quot;<br/><br/>A cold realization washed over Herod. &quot;She took it. After she shot me. Before you arrived.&quot;<br/><br/>Morgan&#x27;s face remained impassive. &quot;That&#x27;s convenient for your story.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s the truth,&quot; Herod insisted, frustration making his heart rate spike. The machines beside him beeped faster. &quot;Rose Lewis planned and executed the bombings. I knew about them but didn&#x27;t stop her. I&#x27;m guilty of conspiracy, but she was the one who actually planted the devices.&quot;</div>
