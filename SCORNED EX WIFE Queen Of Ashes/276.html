        <h1>Chapter 176-2</h1>
        <div><br/>A guard looked over, brow furrowed. Rose forced her face into blankness, years of practice making it second nature, but inside, acid burned through her veins.<br/><br/>&quot;Ms. Lewis,&quot; the guard called from across the room. &quot;Everything all right over there?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Fine,&quot; Rose answered, her voice honey-sweet. &quot;Just caught up in the news.&quot;<br/><br/>The guard studied her a moment longer, then returned to his conversation with another staff member. Rose&#x27;s attention snapped back to the screen where Camille was answering a question about her plans for the company.<br/><br/>&quot;I can confirm that Kane Industries will be realigning certain holdings,&quot; Camille was saying. &quot;Details will be released tomorrow.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose sat forward, suddenly alert. The hospital gown gaped at her neck, revealing collar bones that had grown sharp during her weeks in custody.<br/><br/>&quot;Realigning holdings,&quot; she repeated, eyes narrowed. &quot;What does that mean?&quot;<br/><br/>A terrible suspicion formed. The Rodriguez Shipping assets, the ones Kane Industries had acquired during Camille&#x27;s revenge campaign against Stefan. Was she giving them back to him? After everything he&#x27;d done?<br/><br/>The thought made Rose&#x27;s stomach twist with fresh fury. Of course Camille would forgive Stefan. She had always been weak that way, always ready to excuse betrayal, to offer second chances.<br/><br/>Not like Rose. Rose never forgave. Never forgot.<br/><br/>Questions continued from journalists about the company&#x27;s direction, about Victoria&#x27;s health, about Camille&#x27;s own background. With each smooth, articulate answer, Rose&#x27;s rage grew hotter, brighter, consuming her from within.<br/><br/>&quot;Look at her,&quot; she said to no one. &quot;So polished. So perfect. Fooling them all.&quot;<br/><br/>But the woman on screen wasn&#x27;t fooling anyone. She radiated authentic authority, answering each question with thoughtful precision. Not a trace remained of the naive, trusting woman Rose had so easily manipulated. This was someone else entirely. Someone stronger.<br/><br/>Someone Rose had failed to destroy.<br/><br/>The final question came from a reporter in the back row, his tone insinuating.<br/><br/>&quot;Ms. Kane, many observers have noted your meteoric rise. Just three years ago, you were unknown in business circles. How do you respond to allegations that your connection to Victoria Kane is... personal rather than professional?&quot;<br/><br/>Rose leaned forward, suddenly hungry for Camille&#x27;s discomfort. This was it, the question that would expose the fraud, that would make her stumble.<br/><br/>Instead, Camille&#x27;s voice remained clear and direct.<br/><br/>&quot;Victoria Kane rescued me when I had nothing. She saw potential when others saw only brokenness. She taught me to transform pain into power. So yes, our connection is deeply personal.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s hands curled into fists as Camille continued.<br/><br/>&quot;But make no mistake.... I stand here today not because of sentiment, but because of proven ability. My record at Kane Industries speaks for itself. The Phoenix Grid. The Green Harbor Initiative. The expansion into Asian markets that increased revenues by twenty-two percent last quarter.&quot;<br/><br/>The numbers meant nothing to Rose. All she heard was victory in Camille&#x27;s voice. All she saw was the quiet confidence of a woman who had not just survived, but triumphed.<br/><br/>&quot;I didn&#x27;t inherit this position,&quot; Camille stated firmly. &quot;I earned it. And I intend to prove that every day going forward.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria stepped forward then, placing a hand on Camille&#x27;s shoulder, a public gesture of support never before seen from the notoriously cold businesswoman.<br/><br/>&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, Camille Kane,&quot; Victoria announced, and the room erupted in applause.<br/><br/>In the prison ward, Rose stared at the screen as Camille and Victoria stood together, the older woman&#x27;s hand on the younger&#x27;s shoulder. The image burned into her mind, each pixel a separate agony.<br/><br/>&quot;That should be me,&quot; she whispered.<br/><br/>For years, Rose had plotted and schemed. Had manipulated everyone around her. Had dedicated her life to claiming what she believed should have been hers, family, love, success, recognition.<br/><br/>And now here was Camille, her sister, her enemy, her obsession, receiving all of it. Not just surviving Rose&#x27;s attempts to destroy her, but thriving. Rising higher than Rose had even imagined possible.<br/><br/>The television cut to a commercial break. Rose remained motionless, seeing not the advertisement but Camille&#x27;s face. The confidence. The poise. The absolute certainty that she belonged exactly where she was.<br/><br/>Something cracked inside Rose&#x27;s chest. A dam breaking, flooding her with rage so pure it felt almost like clarity.<br/><br/>&quot;Camille,&quot; she breathed, fingers curling into claws against her thighs. &quot;I should have killed you when I had the chance.&quot;<br/><br/>A guard passing by paused, hearing the venom in her voice. &quot;Everything okay here, Lewis?&quot;<br/><br/>Rose smoothed her expression, the mask slipping back into place with practiced ease. &quot;Just watching the news,&quot; she said, voice dripping sweetness. &quot;Isn&#x27;t it interesting how some people just seem to have all the luck?&quot;<br/><br/>The guard nodded warily and moved on. Rose&#x27;s gaze returned to the television, waiting for Camille to reappear.<br/><br/>In her mind, she was no longer in the hospital ward. She was back at the cabin, holding a gun to Camille&#x27;s head. Only this time, she didn&#x27;t hesitate. This time, she pulled the trigger.<br/><br/>&quot;Next time,&quot; she promised the empty air. &quot;Next time, I won&#x27;t make the same mistake.&quot;<br/><br/>The newscast returned, showing footage of Camille leaving the podium, Victoria at her side. The two women walked together, powerful, unified. Untouchable.<br/><br/>For now.<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s lips curved in a smile that never reached her eyes. Her fingers found the thin scar at her wrist, tracing its outline. The doctors thought her progress was remarkable. The medication was working. The therapy was helping. Soon, they&#x27;d recommend moving her to a less restrictive facility.<br/><br/>She would be patient. Would play their game. Would say all the right things.<br/><br/>And when the moment came, and it would come, she would be ready.<br/><br/>The camera zoomed in on Camille&#x27;s face one last time. Confident. Serene. Unaware that miles away, behind secure walls, her sister watched and waited and planned.<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s whisper was barely audible, lost in the ambient noise of the ward. But the promise in it was absolute.<br/><br/>&quot;This isn&#x27;t over, sister dear..&quot;<br/></div>
