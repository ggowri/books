        <h1>Chapter 157-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 157<br/><br/>Alexander Pierce stood in the hospital corridor outside Victoria&#x27;s room, cell phone pressed to his ear as he absorbed the news.<br/><br/>&quot;You&#x27;re certain it&#x27;s her?&quot; he asked the FBI agent on the other end of the line.<br/><br/>&quot;One hundred percent,&quot; came the reply. &quot;Clear facial match in multiple video segments. We&#x27;re preparing to release the footage to the media within the hour.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I want to see it first,&quot; Alexander insisted. &quot;Send it to my secure email immediately.&quot;<br/><br/>After ending the call, Alexander leaned against the wall, the weight of the news settling on his shoulders. They had suspected Rose from the beginning, of course. Known in their hearts who was responsible. But confirmation brought its own burden, the question of how to tell Camille.<br/><br/>She had barely left Victoria&#x27;s bedside in the five days since the bombing. The unexpected hopeful news about Victoria&#x27;s treatment options had lifted some of the darkness from Camille&#x27;s spirits, but she remained fragile, caught between relief that Victoria might have years rather than months and fury at Rose for accelerating her illness with the bombing.<br/><br/>Now Alexander held proof of Rose&#x27;s guilt in his hands. Not conjecture or suspicion, but undeniable visual evidence.<br/><br/>He checked his phone as the email arrived, opening the video files and watching them in grim silence. There was Rose, her movements calm and deliberate as she placed the bombs that would kill six people. No hesitation. No sign of conflict. Just cold, calculated destruction.<br/><br/>Alexander closed the files, his decision made. Camille needed to know before she saw it on the news. She deserved that much.<br/><br/>He knocked softly on Victoria&#x27;s door before entering. Camille sat beside the bed as always, but Victoria was awake today, her color somewhat improved from yesterday. They both looked up as he entered.<br/><br/>&quot;What is it?&quot; Camille asked immediately, reading his expression. &quot;Something&#x27;s wrong.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander moved to her side, placing a hand on her shoulder. &quot;The FBI has identified the bomber from security footage,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;It&#x27;s Rose. They have clear images of her placing the devices throughout the hotel.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille&#x27;s face remained perfectly still, but Alexander felt the slight tremble that ran through her body at his words.<br/><br/>&quot;Show me,&quot; she said.<br/><br/>&quot;Camille...&quot; Victoria began, concern in her voice.<br/><br/>&quot;I need to see it,&quot; Camille insisted. &quot;Show me the footage.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander hesitated, then handed her his phone with the video cued up. Camille took it, her hand steady despite the storm he knew must be raging inside her. Victoria motioned for Alexander to help her sit up higher so she could see the screen as well.<br/><br/>Together they watched as Rose moved through the hotel, planting the bombs that would devastate their lives. Camille&#x27;s expression hardened with each passing second, while Victoria&#x27;s remained carefully neutral, the perfect mask she had perfected over decades in business.<br/><br/>When the video ended, Camille handed the phone back to Alexander, her movements controlled. Too controlled.<br/><br/>&quot;They&#x27;re issuing a nationwide manhunt,&quot; Alexander continued. &quot;Her face will be on every news channel within the hour. The FBI wanted us to know first.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria reached for Camille&#x27;s hand. &quot;Now everyone will know the truth.&quot;<br/><br/>But Camille didn&#x27;t seem to hear her. &quot;Six people dead,&quot; she said, her voice distant. &quot;Six people who came to support my foundation. Who believed in what we were trying to build.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This isn&#x27;t your fault,&quot; Alexander said firmly.<br/><br/>&quot;I know whose fault it is,&quot; Camille replied, an edge of steel entering her voice. &quot;I&#x27;ve always known.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria tightened her grip on Camille&#x27;s hand. &quot;Remember your promise to me.&quot;<br/><br/>The simple words seemed to penetrate Camille&#x27;s hardening shell. She looked at Victoria, conflict evident in her eyes, the promise to choose creation over destruction battling with the raw anger the footage had rekindled.<br/><br/>&quot;I remember,&quot; she said finally. &quot;But that doesn&#x27;t mean I can&#x27;t want justice.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Justice, yes,&quot; Victoria agreed. &quot;Revenge, no.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s phone rang again, the FBI with updated information. He stepped out into the hallway to take the call, leaving Camille and Victoria to their private struggle.<br/><br/>When he returned minutes later, his expression had changed.<br/><br/>&quot;What now?&quot; Camille asked.<br/><br/>&quot;They&#x27;ve released her photo to the media,&quot; Alexander reported. &quot;And they&#x27;ve found something else, a rental car registered to one of Rose&#x27;s aliases. It was abandoned near the bus station the night of the bombing.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;She&#x27;s running,&quot; Victoria said.<br/><br/>&quot;Yes. But she left something behind.&quot; Alexander hesitated. &quot;A notebook. It contained detailed plans of Kane Industries headquarters. Floor plans. Security protocols. Staff schedules.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille went perfectly still. &quot;She was planning to target the company next.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It appears that way,&quot; Alexander confirmed. &quot;The FBI believes the hotel bombing was just the first phase of a larger plan.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s monitoring machines beeped as her heart rate increased slightly. &quot;Is there any indication of where she might have gone?&quot;</div>
