        <h1>Chapter 141-2</h1>
        <div><br/>The question hung between them. Margaret&#x27;s hands trembled slightly as she clasped them in her lap.<br/><br/>&quot;No,&quot; she said finally, her voice firm. &quot;Never again. Rose tried to have my daughter killed. No mother could forgive that.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria studied her face, looking for deception. Finding none, she nodded slowly. &quot;Good. Because Rose will return. People like her always do. And when she does, Camille will need people who see clearly. Who won&#x27;t be fooled by whatever mask Rose wears next.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I won&#x27;t be fooled,&quot; Margaret promised. &quot;Neither will Richard. We&#x27;ve read the journals. We&#x27;ve seen the evidence. We know who Rose really is now.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria felt a wave of pain wash through her body. She closed her eyes briefly, waiting for it to pass. When she opened them, Margaret was watching her with concern.<br/><br/>&quot;You need medical attention,&quot; Margaret said. &quot;I&#x27;ll call—&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No.&quot; Victoria&#x27;s voice was sharp. &quot;I&#x27;ve seen every specialist worth seeing. There&#x27;s nothing more to be done.&quot; She took a shaky breath. &quot;Which is why this conversation is so important. I&#x27;ve made legal arrangements for Camille. Financial provisions. But money and power aren&#x27;t enough. She&#x27;ll need family. Real family.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We want to be there for her,&quot; Margaret said softly. &quot;We&#x27;ve been trying to rebuild our relationship. It&#x27;s slow, but...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;There&#x27;s no more time for slow,&quot; Victoria cut her off. &quot;I need your promise now. That you&#x27;ll support Camille unconditionally. That you&#x27;ll stand with her against Rose, against anyone who tries to use her or hurt her.&quot;<br/><br/>Margaret&#x27;s chin lifted slightly. &quot;I promise. I should have made that choice years ago.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria nodded, some of the tension leaving her body. &quot;And Pierce? What do you think of him?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;He clearly loves her,&quot; Margaret said. &quot;And she loves him. They seem good together.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;They are.&quot; Victoria agreed. &quot;Better than I expected. He&#x27;s been good for her.&quot; She paused. &quot;I&#x27;ve made my peace with him. With others too.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Others?&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria smiled thinly. &quot;Death focuses the mind wonderfully, Mrs. Lewis. I&#x27;ve spent decades building a fortress of grudges and vendettas. Now I find myself... clearing accounts.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Forgiveness doesn&#x27;t seem like your style,&quot; Margaret observed.<br/><br/>&quot;Not forgiveness,&quot; Victoria corrected. &quot;Reconciliation where possible. Resolution where necessary.&quot; She looked down at her desk, at the medical report she&#x27;d pushed aside. &quot;I&#x27;ve made mistakes too, you know. Hurt people out of pride or anger or grief.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Like who?&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria considered the question. &quot;Like you. I took Camille from you.&quot;<br/><br/>Margaret shook her head. &quot;No. We lost her through our own blindness. You saved her.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Perhaps.&quot; Victoria paused, feeling another wave of pain. &quot;But I also wanted to punish you. To show you what a real mother would do for her child.&quot;<br/><br/>The admission hung in the air between them. Victoria was surprised by how much lighter she felt having said it aloud.<br/><br/>&quot;Were you a real mother to your own daughter?&quot; Margaret asked quietly. &quot;Before she died?&quot;<br/><br/>The question should have angered her. Instead, Victoria felt a strange urge to answer honestly. &quot;No. I was too busy building my empire. Too focused on proving myself in a man&#x27;s world.&quot; Her voice dropped. &quot;Sophia paid the price for my ambition. She died because I made enemies who took their revenge on her.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m sorry,&quot; Margaret said, and seemed to mean it.<br/><br/>Victoria waved away the sympathy. &quot;That&#x27;s why I took in Camille. She reminded me of Sophia. Of who she might have become if I&#x27;d protected her better.&quot; She looked directly at Margaret. &quot;I won&#x27;t make the same mistake with Camille. I&#x27;ll protect her until my last breath.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And after that?&quot; Margaret asked. &quot;What then?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;After that, she&#x27;ll have you. And Pierce. And the tools I&#x27;ve given her to protect herself.&quot; Victoria&#x27;s voice strengthened with determination. &quot;But I need your word. Your solemn promise that you&#x27;ll be the mother she deserves. That you&#x27;ll never choose Rose over her again, no matter what lies Rose tells.&quot;<br/><br/>Margaret stood, unexpected strength in her posture. &quot;I promise. On my life. I choose Camille. I will always choose Camille from now on.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria nodded, satisfied. &quot;Then there&#x27;s one more thing I need from you.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What&#x27;s that?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Don&#x27;t tell Camille about my condition. Not yet. Let her focus on the Phoenix Grid, on Rose&#x27;s threats. Let her have this time without the shadow of my death hanging over her.&quot;<br/><br/>Margaret frowned. &quot;She deserves to know.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;She deserves peace,&quot; Victoria countered. &quot;Time to be happy with Pierce. Time to focus on building something, not losing someone.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;When will you tell her?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;When the time is right. When I can&#x27;t hide it anymore.&quot; Victoria sighed. &quot;Or when the end is near enough that she won&#x27;t have long to suffer through my decline.&quot;<br/><br/>Margaret looked as if she wanted to argue, then nodded reluctantly. &quot;I&#x27;ll keep your secret. For now. But don&#x27;t wait too long, Victoria. She&#x27;ll never forgive you if you don&#x27;t give her the chance to say goodbye.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria allowed herself a small smile. &quot;Now you&#x27;re finally thinking like her mother.&quot;<br/><br/>Margaret returned the smile, tentative but real. &quot;Perhaps we both are, in our own ways.&quot;<br/><br/>As their meeting concluded and Margaret prepared to leave, Victoria felt a strange sense of peace. One more piece secured for Camille&#x27;s future. One more protection in place for when Victoria was gone.<br/><br/>She watched Margaret leave, then turned back to the medical report. Six months. Maybe less.<br/><br/>It would have to be enough time to finish what she&#x27;d started. To make peace where she could, to settle old scores where she must, and to make sure Camille would be surrounded by people who truly loved her when Victoria was gone.<br/><br/>Outside her window, the sun broke through the clouds, sending shafts of golden light across the city. Victoria touched the glass, feeling its warmth.<br/><br/>&quot;Be happy, Camille,&quot; she whispered to the empty room. &quot;Be strong. Be loved.&quot;<br/><br/>The words felt like a prayer, like a promise, like a goodbye.<br/></div>
