        <div><br/>He looked up, hope in his eyes. &quot;Is it enough?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I don&#x27;t know yet,&quot; she answered honestly. &quot;But it&#x27;s not nothing.&quot;<br/><br/>He seemed to understand that this was the most she could offer right now. He nodded and raised his glass slightly. &quot;He seems like a good man. Better than—&quot; He stopped himself.<br/><br/>&quot;Better than Stefan? Yes. Very much so.&quot; Camille&#x27;s voice held no bitterness, only certainty.<br/><br/>Across the room, Victoria tapped her glass, bringing the happy chatter to a halt. All heads turned to her, respect automatic in their attentiveness.<br/><br/>&quot;I would like to say something,&quot; she announced. Her voice, usually so controlled and measured, held an unusual note of emotion.<br/><br/>She moved to stand beside Camille, tall and straight as always, but with a softness in her eyes few ever witnessed.<br/><br/>&quot;Twenty two months ago,&quot; Victoria began, &quot;I found a young woman who had lost everything. Her marriage. Her family. Her sense of self.&quot;<br/><br/>The room grew utterly still. Victoria rarely spoke of that night, of how she and Camille had come together.<br/><br/>&quot;What struck me then was not her pain, though it was considerable. Not her loss, though it was great.&quot; Victoria&#x27;s gaze swept the room before returning to Camille&#x27;s face. &quot;What struck me was her fire. Her refusal to be extinguished.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille felt her throat tighten with emotion.<br/><br/>&quot;I have built companies. I have created wealth. I have won battles in boardrooms across the world,&quot; Victoria continued. &quot;But nothing.... nothing.... has given me more pride than watching this woman transform herself from victim to victor. From broken to whole. From lost to found.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria raised her glass. &quot;The Phoenix Grid is a remarkable achievement. But it pales beside the achievement of its creator&#x27;s transformation. I could not be prouder of the woman Camille has become if she were my own daughter by blood.&quot;<br/><br/>Tears filled Camille&#x27;s eyes. Around the table, others dabbed at their eyes as well. Even Victoria&#x27;s voice wavered slightly as she concluded:<br/><br/>&quot;To Camille. May your future with Alexander bring you the happiness you have earned through your strength, your courage, and your unwavering spirit.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;To Camille,&quot; everyone echoed, raising their glasses.<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s arm slipped around her waist, steadying her as emotion threatened to overwhelm her. Victoria&#x27;s words.... so unexpected, so heartfelt, had reached places inside her she had thought permanently closed.<br/><br/>As conversations resumed around them, Victoria leaned close to Camille&#x27;s ear. &quot;I meant every word,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;Never doubt that.&quot;<br/><br/>Before Camille could respond, Victoria straightened, her usual composed demeanor returning. &quot;Now, I believe someone mentioned dessert?&quot;<br/><br/>The moment passed, but its impact remained. Camille moved through the rest of the evening in a glow of happiness she had never expected to feel again after the night Rose and Stefan shattered her world.<br/><br/>Later, as guests began to leave, her mother approached with her father behind her.<br/><br/>&quot;We want you to have this,&quot; her mother said, pressing the small gift bag into Camille&#x27;s hands. &quot;It&#x27;s not much, but...&quot;<br/><br/>Camille opened it to find a small silver frame. Inside was a photo she had never seen before, herself at about six years old, playing piano at her first recital, face intense with concentration.<br/><br/>&quot;Before everything got complicated,&quot; her father explained. &quot;When you were just our little girl with a big talent.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille stared at the photo, at the child she had been before Rose, before disappointments, before pain. Something turned over in her heart.<br/><br/>&quot;Thank you,&quot; she said softly. &quot;Really.&quot;<br/><br/>It wasn&#x27;t forgiveness exactly. Not yet. But it was acknowledgment of the possibility.<br/><br/>As the last guests departed, Camille found herself on the balcony, watching the city glow with the power her Grid provided. Alexander joined her, wrapping his arms around her from behind.<br/><br/>&quot;Happy?&quot; he asked, his breath warm against her ear.<br/><br/>&quot;Yes,&quot; she answered truthfully. &quot;For perhaps the first time in years.&quot;<br/><br/>She turned in his arms to face him. &quot;Victoria&#x27;s words... my parents trying... Hannah&#x27;s excitement about our engagement... it felt like...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Like family,&quot; Alexander finished for her. &quot;The family you&#x27;ve built for yourself.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded, resting her head against his chest. The steady beat of his heart grounded her in this moment of perfect contentment.<br/><br/>Inside the penthouse, Victoria was speaking with Hannah about tomorrow&#x27;s Grid maintenance schedule. Some things never changed. The thought made Camille smile.<br/><br/>&quot;We did it,&quot; she whispered. &quot;We really did it.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The Grid?&quot; Alexander asked.<br/><br/>&quot;Everything. The Grid. Surviving Rose&#x27;s attacks. Finding our way to each other.&quot; She looked up at him. &quot;Living instead of just existing.&quot;<br/><br/>He kissed her then, gentle and promising at once. Above them, stars glittered in the clear night sky. Below them, the city hummed with power, their power, created together.<br/></div>
