        <h1>Chapter 142-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 142<br/><br/>The morning news blared from the small TV in their latest hideout, a run-down motel on the outskirts of the city. Herod sat on the edge of the bed, watching his own face flash across the screen. The reporter&#x27;s voice filled the cramped room.<br/><br/>&quot;Federal authorities have issued an arrest warrant for Herod Preston, naming him as the primary suspect in the Phoenix Grid bombings. Officials cite overwhelming evidence found in Preston&#x27;s apartment, including detailed plans and materials matching those used in the attacks.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose emerged from the bathroom, her wet hair wrapped in a towel. &quot;Turn that off,&quot; she snapped. &quot;We already know what they&#x27;re saying.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod didn&#x27;t move. His eyes remained fixed on the screen as the reporter continued.<br/><br/>&quot;Sources close to the investigation reveal Preston had a long-standing grudge against Victoria Kane, whose company developed the Phoenix Grid. If convicted, Preston faces terrorism charges that could carry multiple life sentences without possibility of parole.&quot;<br/><br/>Life in prison. The words echoed in Herod&#x27;s mind. A lifetime behind bars for bombs that were never meant to kill. A future destroyed for a plan that wasn&#x27;t even his.<br/><br/>&quot;I said turn it off!&quot; Rose grabbed the remote and shut off the TV. &quot;Why are you torturing yourself with this garbage?&quot;<br/><br/>Herod looked at her, really looked at her. The woman he thought he loved. The woman who had set him up to take the fall for everything.<br/><br/>&quot;My father&#x27;s old lawyer called,&quot; he said quietly.<br/><br/>Rose froze. &quot;What? When?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This morning. While you were in the shower.&quot; Herod rubbed his hands over his face. &quot;He saw the news. He talked about dishonoring my family&#x27;s memory.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You didn&#x27;t tell him where we are, did you?&quot; Rose&#x27;s eyes narrowed with suspicion.<br/><br/>&quot;No.&quot; Herod stood, walking to the grimy window to look out at the parking lot. &quot;He reminded me of what Charles would think. How disappointed he would be in what I&#x27;ve become.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose laughed, the sound harsh in the small room. &quot;Your brother killed himself because of Victoria Kane. He&#x27;d understand revenge better than anyone.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No.&quot; Herod turned to face her. &quot;We both know that&#x27;s not true. I told you what Charles was like when we first talked about working together. He was gentle. Kind. When Victoria destroyed our family business, he couldn&#x27;t bear the shame, the failure. But he never wanted revenge.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Then he was weak,&quot; Rose said coldly.<br/><br/>Something snapped inside Herod. &quot;He was better than me. Better than both of us.&quot; His voice shook with emotion. &quot;He wouldn&#x27;t have planted bombs. He wouldn&#x27;t have risked innocent lives.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose watched him with calculating eyes. &quot;What&#x27;s gotten into you? Yesterday you were fine with our plans. Now suddenly you&#x27;re having a moral crisis?&quot;<br/><br/>Herod sank back onto the bed, the weight of his choices crushing down on him. &quot;I keep thinking about Charles. About what he would think. About how I&#x27;ve dishonored everything he stood for.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Your brother is dead,&quot; Rose said bluntly. &quot;Your parents killed themselves rather than face reality. You&#x27;re the only Preston left. You get to decide what the name means now.&quot;<br/><br/>The casual cruelty in her voice cut through him. How had he not seen this side of her before? How had he been so blind?<br/><br/>&quot;You never cared about avenging my family, did you?&quot; he asked quietly. &quot;You only cared about using me to get revenge on Camille.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We wanted the same thing,&quot; Rose insisted, sitting beside him. &quot;Revenge against the Kanes. Justice for what they did to us.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No,&quot; Herod shook his head. &quot;You wanted Camille&#x27;s life. Her identity. I was just useful to you because I had resources and a grudge against Victoria.&quot;<br/><br/>Something dark flashed in Rose&#x27;s eyes. &quot;You&#x27;re being ridiculous.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Am I?&quot; Herod stood again, unable to bear her closeness. &quot;I&#x27;ve been watching you. Listening to you. The way you talk about Camille isn&#x27;t normal. It&#x27;s obsessive. You don&#x27;t just want to destroy her, you want to become her.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Shut up,&quot; Rose hissed.<br/><br/>&quot;It makes sense now,&quot; Herod continued, the pieces falling into place. &quot;Why you took her husband. Why you tried to take her parents. Why you hate that she&#x27;s Victoria&#x27;s heir. It was never about hurting her, it was about replacing her.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose stood, her face contorted with rage. &quot;I said shut up!&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What&#x27;s your plan after this, Rose?&quot; Herod pressed. &quot;After you destroy Camille completely? Will you try to take her place with Victoria too? Become the daughter she never had?&quot;<br/><br/>Rose slapped him, the sound cracking through the room. &quot;You know nothing about me.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod touched his stinging cheek, staring at this woman he thought he knew. &quot;I know you set me up to take the fall for everything. I know you left evidence in my apartment. I know you made sure you had alibis while I was planting bombs.&quot;<br/><br/>Fear flickered in Rose&#x27;s eyes before she masked it with anger. &quot;That&#x27;s insane. Why would I do that?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Because you never planned for us to be together after this was over,&quot; Herod said quietly. &quot;I was always going to be the scapegoat. The crazy bomber with a grudge against Victoria Kane.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;If that&#x27;s what you believe, then we have nothing left to discuss,&quot; Rose said coldly, turning away to gather her things.<br/><br/>Herod watched her pack, a strange calm settling over him. &quot;The lawyer reminded me of something Charles used to say.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose didn&#x27;t look up. &quot;I don&#x27;t care what your dead brother said.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;He said it&#x27;s never too late to be the person you should have been.&quot; Herod&#x27;s voice was soft but steady. &quot;I&#x27;ve been living with anger for so long. Blaming Victoria Kane for everything bad in my life. Using that as an excuse to do terrible things.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Spare me the sermon.&quot; Rose zipped her bag closed. &quot;We need to leave. Now.&quot; She glanced at her watch. &quot;I have a contact meeting us at the bus station in an hour. He&#x27;ll get us new IDs, enough to cross the border.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod didn&#x27;t move. &quot;I&#x27;m not going with you.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Don&#x27;t be stupid.&quot; Rose grabbed his arm. &quot;If you stay, they&#x27;ll catch you. You&#x27;ll spend the rest of your life in prison.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Maybe that&#x27;s what I deserve.&quot; Herod pulled his arm away. &quot;For the bombs. For working with you. For betraying everything my brother stood for.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This is ridiculous.&quot; Rose threw his jacket at him. &quot;Get dressed. We&#x27;re leaving in five minutes.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod caught the jacket but didn&#x27;t put it on. &quot;Why did you do it, Rose? Why set me up to take all the blame?&quot;</div>
