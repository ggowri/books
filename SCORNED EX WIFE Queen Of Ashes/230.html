        <h1>Chapter 149-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 149<br/><br/>Spotlights swept across the Grand Plaza Hotel&#x27;s ballroom, catching on crystal chandeliers that scattered light like diamonds. Underneath them, New York&#x27;s elite mingled in formal wear that cost more than most people earned in months. Women draped in silk and jewels. Men in perfectly tailored tuxedos. The soft notes of a string quartet floated above the murmur of conversations and tinkling champagne glasses.<br/><br/>Camille Kane stood just outside the ballroom doors, watching through a crack. Her blue gown shimmered in the dim light of the hallway, but she had never felt less festive.<br/><br/>&quot;Security check complete,&quot; said Jason, Alexander&#x27;s head of security, into his earpiece. &quot;Main floor is clear. Balconies and kitchens clear. All entrances covered.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded, barely hearing him. Her thoughts remained with Victoria, who was gathering her strength in a private room upstairs before making her entrance.<br/><br/>&quot;Camille.&quot; Alexander&#x27;s voice brought her back to the present. He stood beside her in his tuxedo, handsome as ever, though worry lined his eyes. &quot;Everyone&#x27;s waiting. It&#x27;s time.&quot;<br/><br/>She smoothed her dress, checking her reflection in a nearby mirror. Hours of professional makeup had hidden the evidence of her tears, but nothing could conceal the sorrow in her eyes.<br/><br/>&quot;I can&#x27;t believe we&#x27;re doing this,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Pretending everything is normal when Victoria is....&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Following her wishes,&quot; Alexander cut in gently. &quot;Being exactly who she&#x27;s always been.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille touched the phoenix pendant at her throat. &quot;I just want to keep her safe.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I know.&quot; Alexander squeezed her hand. &quot;That&#x27;s why we have thirty security personnel in the ballroom alone. Another twenty covering the surrounding blocks. Two teams on the roof. Nothing gets through tonight.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille wished she could believe him. But the dread that had haunted her since her nightmare remained, hovering at the edges of her mind like a shadow.<br/><br/>&quot;Ms. Kane?&quot; Another security guard approached. &quot;Ms. Victoria Kane is ready for you.&quot;<br/><br/>They followed him to a small elevator reserved for staff. As the doors closed, Camille&#x27;s stomach knotted with anxiety—not for herself, but for what waited upstairs.<br/><br/>The private room on the tenth floor had been converted into a makeshift preparation area. Victoria sat in a chair by the window, her silver hair styled elegantly, her black evening gown showing no hint of the weight she had lost. Only the pallor of her skin and the slight tremor in her hands betrayed her condition.<br/><br/>She looked up as Camille entered, a flicker of vulnerability crossing her face before her usual mask of strength slid back into place.<br/><br/>&quot;You look beautiful,&quot; Victoria said.<br/><br/>Camille approached, kneeling before Victoria&#x27;s chair to look up into her face. &quot;How are you feeling? Really?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Well enough for what needs to be done.&quot; Victoria touched Camille&#x27;s cheek. &quot;No more tears now. Tonight isn&#x27;t about my illness. It&#x27;s about what we&#x27;ve built together.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded, swallowing the lump in her throat. &quot;The doctor said you should only stay an hour. Two at most.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ll stay as long as necessary.&quot; Victoria stood with effort, her back straight despite the pain Camille knew she must be feeling. &quot;Now, help me with these earrings. My hands aren&#x27;t cooperating tonight.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille fastened the diamond earrings, noticing how Victoria&#x27;s cheekbones had become more prominent, how the skin of her neck had grown thinner. Signs she had missed for months.<br/><br/>&quot;Are you ready for your speech?&quot; Victoria asked, checking her reflection.<br/><br/>&quot;Yes.&quot; Camille had spent the afternoon rewriting it, focusing on the foundation&#x27;s initiatives rather than the emotional tribute to Victoria she had originally planned. Victoria had insisted on it. No hint of farewell. No suggestion of endings.<br/><br/>Alexander knocked and entered. &quot;The guests are getting restless. We should make our entrance soon.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria squared her shoulders. &quot;Then let&#x27;s not keep them waiting.&quot;<br/><br/>The three of them took the private elevator down to the main level. Security personnel lined their path to the ballroom. At the doors, the master of ceremonies waited to announce them.<br/><br/>&quot;Remember,&quot; Victoria said quietly to Camille. &quot;Head high. Shoulders back. Show no weakness.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded, taking her place beside her mentor. The doors swung open.<br/><br/>&quot;Ladies and gentlemen,&quot; the announcer&#x27;s voice boomed. &quot;The Grand Plaza Hotel and Kane Industries are proud to present Ms. Victoria Kane and Ms. Camille Kane!&quot;<br/><br/>Applause filled the room as they entered, Victoria moving with a grace that belied her condition. Camille felt the weight of hundreds of eyes upon them as they made their way through the crowd. Important people stepped forward to greet them, politicians, business leaders, celebrities. All wanting a moment with the famous Kane women.<br/><br/>Through it all, Camille scanned the room. Not for familiar faces, but for unfamiliar ones. For staff members who didn&#x27;t belong. For anyone who might be working for Rose.<br/><br/>&quot;Stop looking so tense,&quot; Victoria murmured as they accepted champagne from a waiter. &quot;You&#x27;ll make everyone nervous.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille forced a smile. &quot;I can&#x27;t help it. I feel like she&#x27;s here. Watching us.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;If she is, she&#x27;ll regret it.&quot; Victoria nodded toward the perimeter of the room, where security personnel stood at regular intervals. &quot;Alexander has this place locked down tighter than Fort Knox.&quot;<br/><br/>Before Camille could respond, the mayor approached, hand extended.<br/><br/>&quot;Victoria! Magnificent as always. And Camille, you look stunning.&quot; He bent to kiss Victoria&#x27;s cheek. &quot;I hear you&#x27;ve raised over three million tonight for the children&#x27;s hospital wing.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Four million now,&quot; Victoria corrected with a smile. &quot;The Westfield Foundation doubled their contribution this afternoon.&quot;<br/><br/>The conversation continued, Victoria playing her role perfectly. If the mayor noticed her occasional winces of pain, he showed no sign. Camille stayed close, ready to support Victoria if needed, while maintaining her own part in the social dance.<br/><br/>After what seemed like hours but was likely only thirty minutes, the master of ceremonies called for attention.<br/><br/>&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats for dinner and the program.&quot;<br/><br/>As guests moved toward the elegantly set tables, Alexander appeared at Camille&#x27;s side.<br/><br/>&quot;Everything okay?&quot; he asked quietly.<br/><br/>&quot;So far.&quot; Camille glanced at Victoria, who was now seated at the head table, engaged in conversation with the hospital director. &quot;Any sign of trouble?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;None. Every guest has been verified. Every staff member checked and double-checked.&quot; He touched the small earpiece he wore. &quot;Security teams are reporting all clear at regular intervals.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded, not entirely relieved. &quot;Keep watching.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Always.&quot; Alexander escorted her to her seat beside Victoria.<br/><br/>Dinner passed in a blur of exquisite food that Camille barely tasted and conversation she hardly heard. Her focus remained on Victoria, who ate little but spoke with animation, her public persona never slipping.<br/><br/>When the dessert plates were cleared, the master of ceremonies returned to the microphone.<br/><br/>&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to introduce Ms. Camille Kane, Executive Director of the Phoenix Foundation.&quot;<br/><br/>The ballroom erupted in applause as Camille stood and made her way to the podium. Hundreds of expectant faces turned toward her. In the back of the room, security personnel remained vigilant. Camille took a deep breath and began.<br/><br/>&quot;Thank you all for coming tonight. Your generosity will change countless lives.&quot; She looked out at the audience, fixing a smile on her face. &quot;The Phoenix Foundation was born from a simple truth: that from the ashes of our darkest moments, we can rise stronger.&quot;<br/><br/>As she spoke, Camille felt a strange sensation. A prickling at the back of her neck. The feeling of being watched, not by the audience, but by someone else. Someone hidden.</div>
