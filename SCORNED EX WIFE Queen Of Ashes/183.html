        <h1>Chapter 120-2</h1>
        <div><br/>Camille felt Alexander&#x27;s presence beside her, steady and supportive, as she considered her answer.<br/><br/>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said finally. &quot;That experience taught me the difference between shame and privacy. I&#x27;m not ashamed of my relationship with Alexander Pierce. But I did deserve the right to reveal it on my own terms, not through stolen photographs.&quot;<br/><br/>She paused, making eye contact with several reporters around the room. &quot;What happened with my former husband and sister taught me that some connections destroy you. Others help you rebuild. I&#x27;ve been fortunate enough to find the latter.&quot;<br/><br/>Her words resonated through the quiet room. Even Malcolm Reed looked somewhat chastened, though he quickly masked the expression.<br/><br/>&quot;Thank you for your time,&quot; Camille concluded. &quot;We appreciate your understanding as we navigate this situation.&quot;<br/><br/>As they turned to leave the stage, a spontaneous applause broke out, starting with a few journalists in the back and spreading until most of the room had joined in. It wasn&#x27;t universal, but it was significant, a recognition of grace under pressure, of dignity maintained despite invasion.<br/><br/>Backstage, the PR team was already monitoring the immediate reactions. Headlines were appearing on news sites with surprising speed:<br/><br/>*&quot;Kane and Pierce Confirm Relationship: &#x27;Genuine and Important&#x27;&quot;*<br/><br/>*&quot;Power Couple Goes Public: Kane and Pierce Address Photos Head-On&quot;*<br/><br/>*&quot;Business Leaders Turn Personal Attack Into Professional Statement&quot;*<br/><br/>Social media was erupting with comments, many supportive:<br/><br/>*&quot;That&#x27;s how you handle a privacy invasion! No denials, no shame, just facts. #KaneAndPierce&quot;*<br/><br/>*&quot;Two brilliant business minds together? The definition of power couple!&quot;*<br/><br/>*&quot;Watching Camille Kane turn an attack into a victory is honestly inspiring.&quot;*<br/><br/>In the privacy of Victoria&#x27;s office, Camille finally allowed her shoulders to relax slightly. &quot;It&#x27;s going better than we expected,&quot; she admitted, scrolling through the reports.<br/><br/>Alexander nodded, loosening his tie. &quot;People respect directness. No denials, no excuses, just the truth.&quot;<br/><br/>Hannah entered with tablet in hand, excitement visible despite her professional demeanor. &quot;The stock is recovering already,&quot; she reported. &quot;Up four points since you started speaking. The transparency approach is working.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille&#x27;s phone buzzed with a message from Victoria: *Well done. First hurdle cleared.*<br/><br/>&quot;What happens now?&quot; Alexander asked, looking around at the team.<br/><br/>&quot;Now we monitor,&quot; Hannah explained. &quot;The initial response is positive, but we need to track how the narrative develops over the next few hours.&quot;<br/><br/>Another staff member approached with a tablet displaying financial news. &quot;Look at this, analysts are praising the potential business synergies between Kane Industries and Pierce Enterprises. They&#x27;re framing your relationship as a potential strategic alliance.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Not exactly romantic,&quot; Alexander commented dryly, &quot;but certainly better than accusations of impropriety.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille smiled for the first time since the photos had appeared online that morning. &quot;We&#x27;ve changed the story from scandal to strategy. Victoria would approve.&quot;<br/><br/>The PR director handed them each a folder. &quot;These are the latest media requests coming in. Everyone wants exclusive interviews, magazine features, in-depth profiles of you both.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No exclusives yet,&quot; Camille decided after a quick glance. &quot;Let&#x27;s stick with the press conference statement for now. Give it time to settle.&quot;<br/><br/>As the team dispersed to continue monitoring the situation, Camille and Alexander found themselves momentarily alone in Victoria&#x27;s office. Through the glass walls, they could see the activity continuing, phones ringing, screens displaying news coverage, staff moving with purpose.<br/><br/>&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Alexander asked quietly, searching her face. &quot;That question about your past...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Was inevitable,&quot; Camille finished. &quot;And answering it honestly was the right choice.&quot; She moved to the window, looking out at the city below. &quot;Rose wanted to use our relationship to destroy me. To remind everyone of how foolish I was the first time around.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Instead, you showed them how much you&#x27;ve grown,&quot; Alexander said, coming to stand beside her. &quot;How much stronger you&#x27;ve become.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded. &quot;Rose never understood that the difference between then and now isn&#x27;t just about who I&#x27;m with. It&#x27;s about who I am.&quot;<br/><br/>Outside the office, Hannah approached with fresh news. &quot;The phones won&#x27;t stop ringing. Every major outlet is praising your handling of the situation. Some are even suggesting the leaked photos were designed to damage you because of the success of the Phoenix Grid.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Keep that narrative going,&quot; Camille instructed. &quot;The focus should be on our companies&#x27; innovations, not our personal lives.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Already happening,&quot; Hannah confirmed, showing them a new headline from CNBC: *&quot;Kane-Pierce Relationship Announcement Coincides with Phoenix Grid Expansion, Coincidence or Strategic Timing?&quot;*<br/><br/>Alexander read it and laughed. &quot;They think we leaked the photos ourselves as a publicity stunt for the Grid.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Better than the alternative,&quot; Camille observed.<br/><br/>Her phone buzzed again with more messages, board members expressing support, business associates offering encouragement. The tide was turning visibly with each passing minute.<br/><br/>One message, from a number she didn&#x27;t recognize, simply read: *This isn&#x27;t over.*<br/><br/>Camille showed it to Alexander, who frowned. &quot;Rose?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Probably,&quot; she agreed, handing the phone to Hannah. &quot;Trace this if possible.&quot;<br/><br/>As the afternoon progressed, the positive response continued to build. Financial analysts began speculating about potential collaborations between Kane Industries and Pierce Enterprises. Social media users created supportive hashtags that quickly trended. Entertainment sites ran glowing pieces about &quot;New York&#x27;s Most Powerful Couple.&quot;<br/><br/>By evening, Kane Industries stock had not only recovered its losses but gained additional points. Pierce Enterprises was similarly thriving. What had been intended as a destructive scandal had transformed into a publicity windfall for both companies.<br/><br/>&quot;We should head to the gala soon,&quot; Alexander reminded her as the work day came to a close. The Hamilton Foundation Gala, their first public appearance as an acknowledged couple, awaited them.<br/><br/>Before leaving, Camille paused at her desk, looking at a notification that had just appeared on her screen. A new article from the New York Spectator, Malcolm Reed&#x27;s publication that had broken the yacht photos that morning.<br/><br/>The headline read: *&quot;Kane and Pierce: A Modern Business Romance That Defies Convention.&quot;*<br/><br/>The same outlet that had sought to humiliate them hours earlier was now framing their relationship as aspirational, forward-thinking, revolutionary. The article quoted relationship experts, business analysts, and social commentators, all praising the couple&#x27;s approach to the situation.<br/><br/>Camille felt a surge of satisfaction that went beyond professional victory. This was personal vindication, proof that she had truly transformed from the woman who had once been destroyed by betrayal into someone who could face humiliation with dignity and emerge stronger.<br/><br/>&quot;Ready?&quot; Alexander asked, offering his hand.<br/><br/>She took it, feeling the warmth of his fingers around hers. &quot;Ready.&quot;<br/><br/>Together, they walked toward the elevator, preparing to step out again into the public eye, not as victims of an invasion, but as a united front, stronger for having weathered their first storm together.<br/><br/>Behind them, screens continued to light up with supportive messages and rising stock prices. <br/><br/>The story was no longer about leaked photos or fabricated documents. It was about two people who had chosen to stand together, openly and without shame, turning vulnerability into strength.<br/></div>
