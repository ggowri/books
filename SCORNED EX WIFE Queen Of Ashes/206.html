        <h1>Chapter 135-2</h1>
        <div><br/>&quot;Incoming power surge!&quot; Hannah suddenly called out. &quot;Junction 17 is overloading!&quot;<br/><br/>All heads turned to the main display. Junction 17—a key connection point for the northern sector—flashed red.<br/><br/>&quot;It shouldn&#x27;t be surging,&quot; Camille said, rushing back to the controls. &quot;We rerouted away from that section.&quot;<br/><br/>Hannah&#x27;s hands flew over her keyboard. &quot;Someone&#x27;s tampering with the load balancers remotely. They&#x27;re forcing power into that junction.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Shut it down!&quot; Camille ordered.<br/><br/>&quot;I can&#x27;t! The controls aren&#x27;t responding!&quot; Hannah&#x27;s voice rose with panic.<br/><br/>Alexander moved to another terminal. &quot;It&#x27;s a secondary attack. They&#x27;re hacking the system while we&#x27;re distracted by the explosion.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille felt cold dread spread through her chest. Rose hadn&#x27;t just planned a physical attack, she&#x27;d coordinated a cyber attack to follow, hitting them when their defenses were focused elsewhere.<br/><br/>&quot;Manual override,&quot; Camille decided. &quot;We need to physically disconnect Junction 17 before it overloads and takes down the northern sector.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That would mean going on-site,&quot; Hannah said. &quot;The junction box is in the Riverside facility.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I know.&quot; Camille grabbed her jacket. &quot;Alexander, stay here and coordinate with Hannah. I&#x27;m going to Riverside.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander caught her arm. &quot;It could be a trap.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Of course it&#x27;s a trap,&quot; Camille replied, her eyes hard. &quot;But if we lose the northern sector, hospitals will lose power. People could die.&quot;<br/><br/>He held her gaze for a long moment, then nodded. &quot;Take security with you.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No time,&quot; she said, already moving toward the door. &quot;Send them after me. And keep working on the remote override—if you get control back, shut down Junction 17 immediately.&quot;<br/><br/>The drive to Riverside took twelve agonizing minutes. Camille kept Hannah on speakerphone, listening to the worsening situation.<br/><br/>&quot;Junction 17 at one hundred ten percent capacity,&quot; Hannah reported. &quot;Safety systems failing. We&#x27;re losing control of the connected relays.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille pressed the accelerator harder, weaving through early morning traffic. &quot;Hold it together. I&#x27;m almost there.&quot;<br/><br/>The Riverside facility loomed ahead, a concrete building surrounded by chain-link fence. Camille screeched to a halt at the gate, swiping her security card. The gate slid open too slowly. She drummed her fingers on the steering wheel, counting each precious second.<br/><br/>&quot;Junction at one hundred fifteen percent,&quot; Hannah&#x27;s voice crackled through the phone. &quot;Camille, hurry.&quot;<br/><br/>She parked haphazardly and ran for the building entrance. Inside, red emergency lights bathed the corridor in an eerie glow. The hum of electrical equipment grew louder as she approached the main control room.<br/><br/>&quot;Where&#x27;s the manual disconnect?&quot; she asked Hannah.<br/><br/>&quot;East wall, blue panel. You&#x27;ll need your override code.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille pushed through the door into the control room. The junction box dominated the center—a massive metal cabinet with blinking lights and digital readouts showing dangerously high numbers. She spotted the blue panel and ran toward it.<br/><br/>Her fingers trembled as she entered her override code. The panel beeped in acceptance and slid open to reveal a large red lever marked &quot;EMERGENCY DISCONNECT.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m at the disconnect,&quot; she told Hannah. &quot;What happens when I pull it?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Riverside district loses power temporarily. Backup generators will kick in for essential services in thirty seconds.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Junction status?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;One hundred twenty percent. Metal housing is heating up. Camille, if it blows...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It won&#x27;t,&quot; Camille said firmly. She grabbed the lever with both hands. &quot;Disconnecting now.&quot;<br/><br/>She pulled with all her strength. The lever resisted, then gave way with a metallic groan. The lights on the junction box immediately went dark. The hum of power ceased, plunging the room into eerie silence broken only by the sound of Camille&#x27;s rapid breathing.<br/><br/>&quot;Junction 17 offline,&quot; Hannah confirmed through the phone. &quot;Power surge contained.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille sagged against the wall, adrenaline still coursing through her body. &quot;Damage assessment?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Substation 12 destroyed. Junction 17 offline but intact. Grid redistributing power through secondary channels. We&#x27;ve lost redundancy in two sectors, but the system is holding.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s voice came through the speaker. &quot;Security teams are en route to your location. Don&#x27;t leave the building until they arrive.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded, though they couldn&#x27;t see her. &quot;Has anyone called Victoria?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;She&#x27;s already at control headquarters,&quot; Hannah replied. &quot;She arrived right after you left.&quot;<br/><br/>Of course she had. Victoria would never stay away during a crisis.<br/><br/>&quot;The press is gathering outside headquarters,&quot; Alexander added. &quot;They want a statement.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille closed her eyes briefly. Rose hadn&#x27;t just attacked the Grid, she&#x27;d attacked public confidence in their creation. Even with the immediate danger contained, the damage to their reputation could be severe.<br/><br/>&quot;Tell them I&#x27;ll make a statement when I return,&quot; she said. &quot;And Alexander... have security check all other substations and junctions. This might not be the end of Rose&#x27;s attack.&quot;<br/><br/>The line went silent for a moment. &quot;You think there are more bombs?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I think Rose won&#x27;t stop until she&#x27;s destroyed everything we&#x27;ve built,&quot; Camille replied. &quot;Or until we stop her.&quot;<br/><br/>As if to confirm her fears, a distant boom echoed through the early morning air. Camille rushed to the window in time to see smoke rising from another part of the city.<br/><br/>&quot;Alexander! What was that?&quot; she demanded.<br/><br/>His voice came back tight with tension. &quot;Substation 8 just went offline. Another explosion.&quot;<br/><br/>Cold fear gripped Camille&#x27;s heart. One explosion could be managed. Two meant they were facing a coordinated attack designed to bring down the entire Grid.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m coming back,&quot; she said. &quot;Have Hannah start emergency shutdown procedures for all non-essential systems. We need to reduce load on the remaining substations.&quot;<br/><br/>As she hurried back to her car, Camille&#x27;s phone buzzed with a text message from an unknown number. She opened it, already knowing who it would be from.<br/><br/>*Enjoying my surprise, sister? This is just the beginning. Everything you&#x27;ve built will burn.*<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s words glowed on the screen, a digital taunt. Camille&#x27;s fingers tightened around the phone, rage and determination warring within her.<br/><br/>As Camille drove back toward control headquarters, her resolve hardened into something unbreakable. Rose wanted a war? She would get one. But not on her terms. Not anymore.<br/></div>
