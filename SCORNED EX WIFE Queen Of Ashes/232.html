        <h1>Chapter 150-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 150<br/><br/>Rose adjusted the black bow tie of her server&#x27;s uniform, checking her reflection in the service elevator&#x27;s mirrored wall. The disguise was perfect, hair tucked under a cap, face subtly altered with makeup to change her bone structure. No one would recognize her as the woman in the green dress who had shown herself to Camille earlier.<br/><br/>That had been the distraction. This was the real plan.<br/><br/>&quot;Two minutes,&quot; the man beside her said, his Russian accent thick even in those two words. Anton Bessonov had sent his best, Mikhail, a man whose hands had ended many lives. Tonight, those hands carried a black duffel bag that would end many more.<br/><br/>Rose nodded, glancing at her watch. &quot;Security will be focused on the ballroom now. The maintenance corridors should be clear.&quot;<br/><br/>The elevator stopped at the basement level. When the doors opened, Rose peered out first, confirming the hallway was empty before stepping out. Mikhail followed, his movements fluid despite his large frame.<br/><br/>&quot;This way,&quot; Rose whispered, leading him down a dim corridor lined with pipes. The building plans she had memorized guided her through the maze of service areas beneath the Grand Plaza Hotel.<br/><br/>They reached a junction where the corridor split three ways. &quot;You take the west wing,&quot; she instructed, pointing left. &quot;I&#x27;ll handle the east. We meet back here in twenty minutes.&quot;<br/><br/>Mikhail unzipped the duffel bag, revealing six identical black devices. He handed three to Rose. Each was the size of a paperback book, with a digital timer and a small red light.<br/><br/>&quot;Remember,&quot; he said, his voice low and serious. &quot;Place them near support columns. Set timer for sixty minutes.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose took the devices, sliding them carefully into her uniform&#x27;s large pockets. &quot;I know what to do.&quot;<br/><br/>As Mikhail headed down the west corridor, Rose turned east, her heart pounding with a mixture of fear and exhilaration. After months of planning, after all the setbacks, she was finally going to win. Finally going to take everything from Camille, just as Camille had taken everything from her.<br/><br/>The first location was the electrical room. Rose slipped inside, finding it mercifully empty. She moved quickly to the main circuit breaker panel, using the magnetic back of the first device to attach it to the metal surface. The tiny screen lit up as she set the timer: 60:00. 59:59. 59:58...<br/><br/>The countdown had begun.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Stefan Rodriguez sipped champagne at the bar, feeling distinctly out of place among the glittering elite of New York society. He hadn&#x27;t expected an invitation to the Phoenix Foundation gala. When it arrived, his first instinct had been to decline. After all, what place did Camille&#x27;s ex-husband have at her triumphant moment?<br/><br/>But Alexander Pierce had called personally, explaining that Stefan&#x27;s intelligence about Rose had been valuable. That his continued help was appreciated. That his presence would show unity against a common enemy.<br/><br/>So here he stood, in a rented tuxedo, watching from a distance as Camille dazzled the crowd. She looked happy, confident, completely transformed from the broken woman who had signed divorce papers eighteen months ago. The sight filled Stefan with a complicated mixture of regret and pride.<br/><br/>&quot;Another champagne, sir?&quot; a server asked.<br/><br/>Stefan shook his head, setting down his half-empty glass. &quot;No, thank you.&quot;<br/><br/>As the server moved away, Stefan&#x27;s attention caught on something unusual, a man in hotel staff uniform entering a door marked &quot;Authorized Personnel Only&quot; near the kitchens. What struck Stefan as odd wasn&#x27;t the act itself, but the way the man checked his watch as he did it. The careful glance around before entering. The subtle bulge in his jacket pocket.<br/><br/>Stefan had spent months learning Rose&#x27;s patterns, her associates, her tactics. That vigilance had become second nature to him.<br/><br/>He set down his glass and moved casually toward the door, pretending to look for the restroom. When he reached it, he hesitated only briefly before pushing it open.<br/><br/>Inside was a service corridor, dimly lit and silent. Stefan closed the door quietly behind him and followed the hallway, his footsteps echoing slightly on the hard floor.<br/><br/>Around a corner, he caught sight of the man again. He was kneeling beside an ornate column that supported the ceiling, placing something against its base. Something small and black, with a glowing digital display.<br/><br/>Stefan&#x27;s blood ran cold as understanding dawned. He backed away slowly, careful not to make a sound, then turned and moved quickly back toward the ballroom. He needed to find security. Now.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>The second device went beneath the kitchen, tucked against a main support beam. Rose worked quickly, efficiently. The kitchen staff was too busy preparing desserts to notice her slip in and out through the back entrance.<br/><br/>As she headed for her third location, the main ventilation system, Rose caught sight of a security guard patrolling the corridor ahead. She ducked into a small cleaning closet, holding her breath as his footsteps approached, then passed. Her heart hammered against her ribcage.<br/><br/>This was the part she loved, the danger, the risk, the knowledge that discovery meant failure. But she wouldn&#x27;t fail. Not tonight. Not when she was so close to destroying everything Camille had built.<br/><br/>When the footsteps faded, Rose continued on her path. The ventilation room was locked, but the key she had taken from the unconscious maintenance worker opened it easily. Inside, massive fans circulated air throughout the building. Rose placed her final device where the blast would damage the maximum number of ducts, potentially filling the entire building with smoke and debris.<br/><br/>Timer set. 42:17. 42:16. 42:15...<br/><br/>She checked her watch. Five minutes until she needed to meet Mikhail. Plenty of time to make her way back through the service corridors. She closed the ventilation room door behind her, locking it to prevent anyone from discovering her handiwork too soon.<br/><br/>As she turned toward the rendezvous point, a voice made her freeze.<br/><br/>&quot;Excuse me, you shouldn&#x27;t be here.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose turned slowly, finding herself face to face with a hotel security guard. His hand rested on his radio, ready to call for backup.<br/><br/>She smiled sweetly. &quot;I&#x27;m so sorry. I got lost looking for the storage room. They sent me to get more napkins for the bar.&quot;<br/><br/>The guard&#x27;s expression remained suspicious. &quot;ID badge?&quot;<br/><br/>Rose fumbled in her pocket as if searching for it, then brought her hand out in a swift, practiced motion. The taser made contact with the guard&#x27;s neck before he could react. He dropped to the floor, body convulsing briefly before going still.<br/><br/>Rose dragged him into the nearby cleaning closet, taking his radio and security badge. She couldn&#x27;t risk him waking and raising the alarm too early.<br/><br/>Time to meet Mikhail and get out before the real show began.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>&quot;Mr. Pierce.&quot; Stefan approached Alexander with urgency, keeping his voice low to avoid alarming nearby guests. &quot;We need to talk. Now.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander excused himself from a conversation with donors and moved to a quieter corner with Stefan. &quot;What is it?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I just saw a man placing what looked like an explosive device near a support column in the service corridor.&quot; Stefan&#x27;s words came out in a rush. &quot;Russian, large build, staff uniform.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander&#x27;s face hardened. &quot;You&#x27;re sure?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Absolutely.&quot; Stefan had never been more certain of anything in his life. &quot;Rose is making her move tonight.&quot;</div>
