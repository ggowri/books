        <h1>Chapter 105-2</h1>
        <div><br/>Camille.<br/><br/>&quot;Have you told her?&quot; Alexander asked quietly, seeming to read her thoughts. &quot;About the stock purchases?&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria shook her head. &quot;She has enough to worry about with the Grid launch.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;She should know. This affects her too.&quot; Alexander&#x27;s voice remained steady, but Victoria heard the underlying steel. His relationship with Camille had shifted, deepened. He was no longer just an ally but a protector.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ll tell her,&quot; Victoria agreed, though reluctantly. &quot;After the shadow engineering team finishes correcting the Grid sabotage.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander nodded, apparently satisfied with that compromise. &quot;In the meantime, I have a suggestion.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m listening.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Let&#x27;s leak information about a major announcement coming from Kane Industries. Something vague but significant sounding.&quot; A slight smile touched Alexander&#x27;s mouth. &quot;Make Herod think we&#x27;re planning a move he hasn&#x27;t anticipated.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria considered the suggestion. &quot;A false flag operation. Force him to react rather than continue his current strategy.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Exactly. And when he reacts, we may learn more about his true objectives.&quot;<br/><br/>For the first time that morning, Victoria felt the tight knot in her chest loosen slightly. This was familiar territory, strategic maneuvering, creating traps for her enemies.<br/><br/>&quot;Have Sarah draft a press release,&quot; she decided. &quot;Something about a significant upcoming partnership announcement. No specifics, just enough to make the business blogs speculate.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander nodded. &quot;I&#x27;ll have my publicist do the same. Hint at cooperation between Pierce Enterprises and Kane Industries on a &#x27;revolutionary new venture.&#x27;&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Stock prices will rise,&quot; Victoria noted. &quot;Costing Herod more if he continues buying shares.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And possibly forcing him to accelerate his plans, whatever they might be.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria set down her coffee cup and moved back to her computer, closing the financial files with decisive clicks. &quot;Let him come. Whatever Herod Preston is planning, he&#x27;ll find I&#x27;m not the easy target his brother thought Sophia was.&quot;<br/><br/>The room fell silent. Victoria rarely mentioned Sophia directly, even now. Alexander watched her, his expression carefully neutral.<br/><br/>&quot;There&#x27;s one more thing we should consider,&quot; he said finally.<br/><br/>Victoria raised an eyebrow. &quot;Yes?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The timing.&quot; Alexander leaned against her desk. &quot;Herod&#x27;s stock purchases began six months ago, long before the Grid sabotage. Before Rose found him.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria went still, the implications racing through her mind. &quot;You think Rose didn&#x27;t find Herod. Herod found Rose.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s worth considering,&quot; Alexander said. &quot;What if Rose wasn&#x27;t the architect of this plan, but merely a useful tool Herod discovered? Someone with personal motivation to hurt Camille, who could be pointed in the right direction and set loose?&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s chest tightened. If Alexander was right, they had potentially misunderstood the entire situation. Rose wasn&#x27;t the snake they needed to worry about, she was merely the venom delivery system for a much more dangerous predator.<br/><br/>&quot;We need to—&quot; Victoria began, but was interrupted by her phone&#x27;s sharp ring.<br/><br/>She answered, listening intently as her security chief spoke. When the call ended, her face had gone pale.<br/><br/>&quot;What is it?&quot; Alexander asked, instantly alert.<br/><br/>&quot;The shadow engineering team discovered a secondary layer of sabotage in the Grid system. More sophisticated than the first.&quot; Victoria&#x27;s voice was tight. &quot;And some of the components were installed by someone with high-level security clearance. Not Walsh.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander straightened. &quot;Someone else on the inside.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yes. Martin Greene most likely. My head of special projects.&quot; Victoria&#x27;s hand clenched around her phone. &quot;He&#x27;s worked for me for fifteen years.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Since Sophia died,&quot; Alexander said quietly.<br/><br/>Victoria nodded, the betrayal cutting deeper than she would admit. &quot;Have him followed. Discreetly. But don&#x27;t move against him yet. If Greene is working with Herod, he may lead us to him.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander nodded. &quot;And Camille?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Double her security detail immediately. Don&#x27;t tell her why.&quot; Victoria moved toward the door, her mind shifting to crisis mode. &quot;I want the entire shadow engineering team moved to the secure facility in White Plains. Today. No contact with anyone outside the team until the Grid corrections are complete.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And the stock purchases?&quot; Alexander asked, following her.<br/><br/>Victoria paused at the door, her face hardening into the expression that had made titans of industry quake for decades. &quot;Let Herod buy whatever he wants. It won&#x27;t matter when this is over.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Victoria,&quot; Alexander said, his voice low. &quot;Don&#x27;t let this become personal.&quot;<br/><br/>She turned, fixing him with a gaze that could have frozen fire. &quot;This has been personal since the moment Charles Preston arranged my daughter&#x27;s death. Herod chose to continue his brother&#x27;s war.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And Rose?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;A useful pawn. Nothing more.&quot; Victoria&#x27;s voice was cold. &quot;We deal with Herod first. Rose is an afterthought.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander didn&#x27;t look convinced. &quot;Don&#x27;t underestimate her. That kind of hatred...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I know exactly how dangerous hatred can be, Alexander.&quot; Victoria cut him off. &quot;I&#x27;ve spent a decade perfecting mine.&quot;<br/><br/>She squared her shoulders, the momentary vulnerability gone, replaced by the steely determination that had built her empire.<br/><br/>&quot;Alert the board members I want an emergency meeting at noon. Prepare the press release about our supposed &#x27;partnership announcement.&#x27; And get Camille additional protection without alarming her.&quot; Victoria&#x27;s tone made it clear these weren&#x27;t requests. &quot;Herod Preston thinks he&#x27;s hunting me. He&#x27;s about to discover he&#x27;s the prey, not the predator.&quot;<br/><br/>As she strode from the office, Alexander remained behind for a moment, troubled by what he&#x27;d seen. The composed, calculating Victoria Kane he knew had briefly vanished, replaced by something rawer, more dangerous. A woman consumed by a decade-old vendetta.<br/><br/>He pulled out his phone and sent a quick text to Camille: *Need to talk. Soon. Something&#x27;s happening with Victoria.*<br/><br/>Then he followed Victoria from the office, wondering if they were all being maneuvered into exactly the positions Herod Preston wanted them in. Like pieces on a chess board, thinking they were making their own moves while actually following the pattern a master player had designed for them.<br/><br/>And if they were, Alexander wasn&#x27;t sure any of them would recognize the trap until it was too late.<br/></div>
