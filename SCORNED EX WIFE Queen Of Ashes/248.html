        <h1>Chapter 159-2</h1>
        <div><br/>Camille turned, meeting Victoria&#x27;s steady gaze.<br/><br/>&quot;She wants you afraid,&quot; Victoria said firmly. &quot;She wants you paralyzed. Reactive. Don&#x27;t give her that power.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I can&#x27;t lose you,&quot; Camille whispered, the words torn from someplace deep and vulnerable. &quot;I can&#x27;t lose any of you.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You won&#x27;t,&quot; Victoria promised. &quot;We&#x27;re prepared now. We&#x27;re ready for her.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander finished his call and rejoined them. &quot;Agent Chen is sending a team to trace the message. They&#x27;ll be here within the hour.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And until then?&quot; Camille asked.<br/><br/>&quot;Until then, we tighten security even further.&quot; Alexander&#x27;s voice was calm, matter-of-fact, a counterpoint to the storm of emotion raging inside Camille. &quot;No one enters this floor without biometric verification and direct approval from me. All staff are being vetted again. Guards at every entrance, exit, and elevator.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;What about my parents?&quot; Camille pressed.<br/><br/>&quot;Agent Chen is sending FBI agents to supplement their security team. They&#x27;re being moved to a safe house as we speak.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille nodded, trying to take comfort in these concrete measures. But the knot of fear in her stomach remained, hard and cold.<br/><br/>A knock on the door made them all tense. Alexander moved to answer it, his hand inside his jacket where Camille knew he carried a weapon. He checked the security monitor beside the door before opening it.<br/><br/>Jason, Alexander&#x27;s head of security, stepped in. &quot;Sir, we&#x27;ve completed the first sweep of the floor. All clear. Additional teams are arriving now to establish the expanded perimeter.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Good,&quot; Alexander said. &quot;Any updates on the trace?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Nothing yet. The tech team says the message was routed through multiple servers. They&#x27;re still working on it.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille listened to this exchange, the professional calm of the two men both reassuring and somehow terrifying. They were preparing for war. A war Rose had brought to their doorstep.<br/><br/>After Jason left, Camille moved to the window, looking out at the city below. Somewhere out there, Rose was watching. Waiting. Planning her next move. The thought made Camille&#x27;s skin crawl.<br/><br/>&quot;She&#x27;ll make a mistake,&quot; Alexander said, coming to stand beside her. &quot;They always do.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You don&#x27;t know Rose,&quot; Camille replied, her voice hollow. &quot;She&#x27;s patient. Careful. She&#x27;s been planning this for years.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No plan survives contact with reality,&quot; Alexander countered. &quot;And the reality is that the entire country is looking for her. Every law enforcement agency. Every airport. Every border crossing.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That won&#x27;t stop her,&quot; Camille insisted. &quot;Not when she&#x27;s this close to what she wants.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And what does she want?&quot; Alexander asked.<br/><br/>Camille turned to him, her eyes haunted. &quot;To see me suffer. To take away everyone I love and watch me break.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Then we don&#x27;t let her,&quot; Alexander said simply. &quot;We protect each other. We stay together. We deny her the victory she wants.&quot;<br/><br/>Victoria&#x27;s voice joined the conversation from her bed. &quot;Alexander is right. Rose&#x27;s weakness has always been her obsession with you. It blinds her. Makes her take risks she shouldn&#x27;t.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille wanted to believe them. Wanted to trust in security teams and FBI agents and locked doors. But she had underestimated Rose before. They all had.<br/><br/>Her phone buzzed again. Another message.<br/><br/>Her heart seemed to stop as she opened it, expecting more threats from Rose. Instead, it was from her father.<br/><br/>*We&#x27;re at the safe house. Your mother is upset but safe. We love you, Camille. Stay strong.*<br/><br/>A small relief in the midst of fear. Her parents were secure, at least for now.<br/><br/>She showed the message to Alexander, who nodded in approval. &quot;One less thing to worry about.&quot;<br/><br/>But a hundred worries remained. A thousand ways Rose could strike at the people Camille loved.<br/><br/>The day crawled by with agonizing slowness. FBI agents arrived to take Camille&#x27;s statement about the threatening message. Security personnel established checkpoints at every entrance to the hospital floor. Doctors and nurses were escorted by guards whenever they entered Victoria&#x27;s room.<br/><br/>Through it all, Camille felt a growing sense of unreality, as if she were watching events unfold from behind glass. This was her life now, armed guards, security checkpoints, fear at every turn. All because her sister would not stop hunting her.<br/><br/>Night fell. Victoria, exhausted from the day&#x27;s tension and her ongoing treatments, fell into a restless sleep. Alexander insisted on staying, setting up a makeshift bed on the small couch in the corner of the room.<br/><br/>Camille sat in the chair beside Victoria&#x27;s bed, unable to sleep despite her own exhaustion. The threatening message played on repeat in her mind. *You took everything from me twice. Now I&#x27;ll take everyone from you.*<br/><br/>&quot;You should rest,&quot; Alexander said softly from the couch. &quot;I&#x27;ll keep watch.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille shook her head. &quot;I can&#x27;t sleep. Not with her message in my head.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander rose and moved to her side, crouching beside her chair. &quot;Rose wants you exhausted. Afraid. Unable to think clearly. Don&#x27;t give her that advantage.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille looked at him, at the steady concern in his eyes, and felt a wave of love so powerful it nearly overwhelmed her. This man, who had chosen to stand beside her despite the danger, who refused to leave her even when a murderer was targeting everyone she cared about.<br/><br/>He was right. Rose wanted her weak. Wanted her broken before the final blow was even struck.<br/><br/>&quot;One hour,&quot; Camille agreed finally. &quot;I&#x27;ll try to sleep for one hour.&quot;<br/><br/>Alexander nodded, satisfied with this small victory. He returned to the couch, maintaining his vigil while Camille reclined in the chair, allowing her eyes to close.<br/><br/>Just before sleep claimed her, a final thought drifted through her mind: Rose had threatened to take everyone from her. But she hadn&#x27;t succeeded yet. Victoria still fought for health and life in the bed beside her. Alexander still guarded her sleep. Her parents waited safely in an FBI safe house.<br/><br/>Rose had made her threat. Camille and those she loved had responded by drawing closer together, by reinforcing their protections, by refusing to be separated.<br/><br/>Perhaps that was the answer. Perhaps the way to defeat Rose was not to run or hide, but to hold tighter to the connections she sought to sever.<br/><br/>With this thought floating through her tired mind, Camille finally drifted into an uneasy sleep.<br/><br/><br/></div>
