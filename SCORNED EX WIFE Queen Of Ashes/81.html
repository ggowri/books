        <h1>Chapter 62-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 62<br/><br/>The charity auction for the Children&#x27;s Medical Research Foundation had transformed the Westmore Hotel&#x27;s grand ballroom into a glittering showcase of wealth. Crystal chandeliers cast golden light over Manhattan&#x27;s elite as they mingled with champagne flutes in hand.<br/><br/>Camille stood near the silent auction display, maintaining the practiced smile Victoria had taught her. Her midnight blue gown and Alexander&#x27;s diamond necklace completed the image of Camille Kane, heiress to the Kane fortune. To everyone watching, she appeared perfectly at ease.<br/><br/>Inside, her nerves twisted like live wires. The event coordinator had just informed her that Richard and Margaret Lewis had arrived, her parents, though they had no idea their &quot;dead&quot; daughter stood in the same room.<br/><br/>&quot;Ms. Kane,&quot; Rebecca murmured, appearing at her side. &quot;They&#x27;ve been seated at table twelve, directly across from the stage. Would you prefer to move your placement?&quot;<br/><br/>Camille sipped champagne, buying seconds to compose herself. &quot;No. Victoria would want me to remain as planned.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Victoria would want you to avoid unnecessary risks,&quot; Rebecca countered.<br/><br/>&quot;Perhaps. But Victoria isn&#x27;t here.&quot;<br/><br/>Rebecca nodded. &quot;I&#x27;ll stay close, just in case.&quot;<br/><br/>As her assistant moved away, Camille allowed her gaze to drift across the room, finding her parents. The sight hit harder than expected. Nineteen months since she&#x27;d last seen them, the night she&#x27;d confronted Rose about Stefan.<br/><br/>Her mother looked older, shadows beneath her eyes that makeup couldn&#x27;t conceal. Her father stood straight-backed as always, but new lines marked his face. Was it grief that had aged them? Or Rose&#x27;s scandals?<br/><br/>A waiter passed with champagne. Camille exchanged her empty glass for a full one, steadying her trembling hands. She should move away. Should minimize the risk of direct interaction. Should protect the revenge plan she and Victoria had executed so meticulously.<br/><br/>Instead, she drifted closer, drawn by something stronger than caution. Not love, that emotion had burned away months ago. Not forgiveness, that was beyond her now. Perhaps simply curiosity about what had become of the people who had once been her world.<br/><br/>She hadn&#x27;t counted on her mother&#x27;s uncanny ability to sense when someone was watching. Before Camille could retreat, Margaret turned, eyes sweeping the crowd before settling directly on her. Their gazes locked across the ballroom.<br/><br/>No recognition showed in Margaret&#x27;s face, only polite interest. But as Camille held her stare a heartbeat too long, something shifted in her mother&#x27;s expression. A slight furrowing of her brow. A tilt of her head. The look of someone encountering a puzzle.<br/><br/>Camille turned away first, pulse racing. Too much risk. She moved toward a display of artwork, pretending absorption in a landscape painting she barely saw.<br/><br/>&quot;Beautiful brushwork,&quot; a voice observed beside her. &quot;The artist captures light in a way that reminds me of Turner.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille&#x27;s blood froze. Her mother&#x27;s voice. So achingly familiar. She turned slowly, face composed in a mask of polite interest.<br/><br/>&quot;You have a good eye,&quot; she replied, amazed at how steady her voice remained.<br/><br/>Margaret Lewis stood closer than Camille had realized, elegant in a navy dress that brought out her blue eyes, eyes that had once looked at Camille with love, then disappointment, then grief.<br/><br/>&quot;Margaret Lewis,&quot; her mother introduced herself, extending a hand. &quot;I don&#x27;t believe we&#x27;ve met, though you look remarkably familiar.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille accepted the handshake, the brief contact sending lightning through her body. <br/><br/>&quot;Camille Kane,&quot; she responded, the name strange on her tongue when speaking to someone who had once known her by another name entirely. <br/><br/>&quot;Ah! I&#x27;ve seen your photos in the business journals. You&#x27;ve made quite an impression since your public debut.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille smiled, Victoria&#x27;s coaching allowing her to maintain the conversation while emotional earthquakes shook her internal landscape. &quot;I&#x27;ve had excellent guidance.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Your mother is certainly a force of nature. My husband and I have admired her business acumen for years, though we&#x27;ve never had the pleasure of working directly with Kane Industries.&quot;<br/><br/>The mention drew Camille&#x27;s gaze past her mother&#x27;s shoulder. Richard Lewis was watching them, expression unreadable from this distance.<br/><br/>&quot;Perhaps that will change in the future,&quot; Camille said carefully. &quot;Kane Industries is always seeking new partnerships.&quot;<br/><br/>Margaret tilted her head slightly, that puzzled look returning. &quot;Forgive me for saying so, but you remind me of someone. I can&#x27;t quite place who.&quot;<br/><br/>Danger. Victoria&#x27;s voice echoed in her memory: &quot;If anyone from your past life shows unusual interest or mentions similarity, end the interaction immediately.&quot;<br/><br/>But some reckless part of her couldn&#x27;t resist pushing further.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ve been told I have one of those faces,&quot; Camille said lightly. &quot;Familiar without being recognizable.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No, it&#x27;s more specific than that.&quot; Margaret studied Camille&#x27;s features. &quot;Something about your expressions. The way you tilt your head when listening. It&#x27;s quite striking.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille&#x27;s heart pounded loudly. Dr. Torres had changed her appearance, sharpened cheekbones, refined her nose, altered her jawline, but no surgeon could change the mannerisms engrained since childhood.<br/><br/>&quot;Love.&quot; Richard Lewis appeared beside his wife. &quot;The Hendersons are looking for us.&quot;<br/><br/>His eyes met Camille&#x27;s briefly, recognition completely absent. The man who had taught her to ride a bike, who had checked her homework, who had walked her down the aisle, looked at her as if she were a perfect stranger.<br/><br/>It cut deeply.<br/><br/>&quot;Richard Lewis,&quot; he introduced himself with a quick handshake. &quot;I see you&#x27;ve met my wife.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Ms. Kane is Victoria Kane&#x27;s daughter,&quot; Margaret explained, still studying Camille. &quot;The one everyone&#x27;s been talking about.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Ah, of course. Your work with the TechVault acquisition was impressive. Quite a debut into the corporate world.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Thank you,&quot; Camille responded, grateful for the shift to professional territory. &quot;Though much of the credit belongs to the team behind the scenes.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Modest as well as accomplished,&quot; Margaret observed with a smile that didn&#x27;t quite reach her eyes. &quot;A rare combination these days.&quot;<br/><br/>Something in her mother&#x27;s tone raised warning flags. That wasn&#x27;t social pleasantry, it was assessment. Margaret might not recognize her daughter, but something about Camille Kane had triggered her curiosity.</div>
