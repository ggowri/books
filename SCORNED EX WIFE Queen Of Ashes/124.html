        <div><br/>Herod&#x27;s phone rang. He excused himself, moving toward his office while Rose remained transfixed by the images on television.<br/><br/>Now they showed Camille&#x27;s house, journalists crowded at the gates while security kept them back. The caption read: &quot;Kane Heiress Remains Secluded as Mental Health Questions Mount.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose felt a rush unlike anything she&#x27;d experienced before, not just satisfaction or triumph, but something deeper and more primal.<br/><br/>Herod returned, his face alight with fresh news. &quot;Alexander Pierce has been making calls to his investigative team. They&#x27;re trying to trace the source of the leaks.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Let them try,&quot; Rose said, unconcerned. &quot;We&#x27;ve covered our tracks.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We have, but vigilance is essential.&quot; Herod checked his watch. &quot;The interview with your parents is scheduled for 9 AM tomorrow. Have you made the necessary arrangements?&quot;<br/><br/>Rose nodded, her expression turning calculating. &quot;My father received documents this morning detailing &#x27;concerns&#x27; about Camille&#x27;s mental state going back years. Along with a reminder about what happened to the last family who publicly contradicted these reports.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;A threat?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;A warning.&quot; Rose smiled thinly. &quot;My father understands self-preservation. He&#x27;ll say exactly what the interviewer expects to hear.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And if he doesn&#x27;t?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Then we release evidence of his offshore accounts.&quot; Rose shrugged. &quot;He doesn&#x27;t know we know about those. But we do, thanks to your financial investigators.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod whistled softly. &quot;You really would destroy your own father.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;He stopped being my father the moment he chose Camille at the Phoenix gala.&quot; Rose&#x27;s voice turned to ice. &quot;Family is just another word for people who haven&#x27;t betrayed you yet.&quot;<br/><br/>A notification chimed on Herod&#x27;s laptop. He moved to check it, his expression shifting from curiosity to delight.<br/><br/>&quot;Kane Industries stock has triggered circuit breakers. Trading temporarily halted after falling twenty percent.&quot; Herod looked up at her. &quot;The market is passing judgment faster than we anticipated.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose closed her eyes, letting the news wash over her. Twenty percent. Billions of dollars in value erased in a single day. Because of her.<br/><br/>&quot;Victoria must be beside herself,&quot; she said, reopening her eyes. &quot;The great business titan, watching her empire crumble.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This is only the beginning of her pain,&quot; Herod reminded her. &quot;When we reveal the Phoenix Grid flaws next week, the real damage begins.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose moved to the bar cart, pouring herself a measure of whiskey. The burn of alcohol down her throat matched the fire of vengeance in her chest.<br/><br/>&quot;I want to be there,&quot; she said suddenly. &quot;When they realize the Phoenix Grid is flawed. I want to see Camille&#x27;s face.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod considered her request. &quot;Risky. You&#x27;re too recognizable now.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;ll find a way.&quot; Rose wasn&#x27;t asking permission. &quot;I&#x27;ve spent too long watching from the sidelines.&quot;<br/><br/>An assistant entered with news about tomorrow&#x27;s interview arrangements. After finalizing details, Rose turned back to Herod. &quot;We should celebrate properly tonight. Dinner at Eleven Madison Park? I&#x27;m suddenly in the mood to be seen.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Bold,&quot; Herod commented. &quot;Flaunting yourself while Camille hides away.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That&#x27;s the point.&quot; Rose drained her whiskey. &quot;I&#x27;m not the one in disgrace anymore. I&#x27;m the victim, remember? The concerned sister who finally found the courage to speak her truth.&quot;<br/><br/>As the afternoon sun began to fade, casting long shadows across the city, Rose returned to the window. Somewhere out there, Camille was hiding, wounded and cornered.<br/><br/>The thought should have been enough. But Rose realized with mild surprise that it wasn&#x27;t.<br/><br/>&quot;What are you thinking about?&quot; Herod asked, noticing her silence.<br/><br/>Rose kept her eyes on the city below. &quot;I&#x27;m thinking that when this is over, when we&#x27;ve taken everything from her... I want her to live.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Live?&quot; Herod sounded surprised. &quot;I would have thought you wanted her destroyed completely.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Death is too quick.&quot; Rose turned, her expression chilling in its calmness. &quot;I want her to live a long, empty life knowing she had everything and lost it. Just like I did.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod studied her for a long moment. &quot;You&#x27;re more dangerous than I initially assessed, Ms. Lewis.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Thank you.&quot; Rose accepted it as the compliment it was meant to be.<br/><br/>As they prepared to leave, Rose paused by the television once more. The screen showed Alexander Pierce entering Camille&#x27;s home, his face grim and determined.<br/><br/>&quot;The white knight rushes to save the damsel,&quot; she murmured.<br/><br/>&quot;Does that concern you?&quot; Herod asked, retrieving his jacket.<br/><br/>Rose shook her head, a slow smile spreading across her face. &quot;No. It&#x27;s perfect actually. When Camille falls, Alexander falls with her. Two enemies destroyed for the price of one.&quot;<br/><br/>She switched off the television, casting the room into sudden silence. The news would still be there tomorrow, with fresh headlines, new revelations, more damage to inflict.<br/><br/>&quot;Ready?&quot; Herod asked, holding open the door.<br/><br/>Rose stepped into the hallway, head high, eyes bright with triumph. &quot;I&#x27;ve been ready for this my entire life.&quot;<br/><br/>Behind them, the penthouse fell quiet, the schematics for the Phoenix Grid laid out on Herod&#x27;s desk like a blueprint not just for a clean energy project, but for the complete devastation of Camille Kane and everything she had built.<br/><br/>The first battle was won. The war continued tomorrow.<br/></div>
