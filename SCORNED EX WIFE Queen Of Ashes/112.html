        <h1>Chapter 79-2</h1>
        <div><br/>Emily turned away, her shoulders rigid. &quot;She&#x27;s ruined us.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;No, Mother. I ruined us. Rose helped. All Camille did was make us face the consequences.&quot;<br/><br/>Eduardo crossed to the bar and refilled his glass. The silence between them stretched painfully before he spoke again.<br/><br/>&quot;The night before your wedding to Camille,&quot; he said quietly, &quot;I had doubts. Not about her, about you. I wondered if you deserved her devotion.&quot; He took a measured sip. &quot;I should have spoken them aloud.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan felt the unexpected truth of those words like a physical blow.<br/><br/>&quot;We still have the property in Madrid,&quot; Eduardo continued. &quot;It&#x27;s modest by our standards, but it&#x27;s paid for. Your mother and I will go there next week.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And me?&quot; Stefan asked, though he already knew the answer.<br/><br/>Eduardo&#x27;s expression was uncharacteristically gentle. &quot;You need to fix this.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Eduardo!&quot; Emily protested. &quot;There&#x27;s nothing to fix! That woman has....&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That woman,&quot; Eduardo interrupted firmly, &quot;has shown more backbone than anyone who&#x27;s ever married into this family. If our son has any hope of salvaging his future, it lies with her.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;She won&#x27;t take me back,&quot; Stefan said. &quot;I&#x27;ve already tried.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Of course she won&#x27;t take you back,&quot; Eduardo scoffed. &quot;Why would she? But there might be a path to redemption that doesn&#x27;t involve reconciliation.&quot;<br/><br/>Emily collapsed onto the sofa, burying her face in her hands. &quot;This is a nightmare. My son, begging for scraps from that woman&#x27;s table.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;That woman,&quot; Stefan said quietly, &quot;has a name. The same name she had when you welcomed her into this family, before you decided Rose was the superior choice.&quot;<br/><br/>Emily&#x27;s head snapped up, her eyes flashing. &quot;Rose was one of us! She understood our world, our obligations. She wasn&#x27;t going to embarrass us at every turn, she doesn&#x27;t lack refinement.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan stared at his mother, truly seeing her perhaps for the first time. The shallow values, the obsession with appearances, the brittle pride masquerading as strength.<br/><br/>&quot;Rose hired men to kill Camille,&quot; he said flatly. &quot;Did you know that? She paid them to attack her own sister in a parking garage and make it look like an accident.&quot;<br/><br/>Emily&#x27;s face drained of color. &quot;You&#x27;re lying.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;She admitted it. In front of me. She wanted Camille gone so badly she was willing to have her murdered.&quot;<br/><br/>Eduardo slumped heavily into a chair. &quot;Dios mío.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;So tell me again, Mother, about Rose&#x27;s superior refinement.&quot;<br/><br/>Emily&#x27;s mouth opened and closed, no words emerging.<br/><br/>&quot;The irony,&quot; Stefan continued, a bitter smile twisting his lips, &quot;is that if Rose had simply waited, she would have had everything she wanted. I gave Camille divorce papers on our anniversary and she signed it.  I betrayed her, but  Rose had to arranged to have her killed.&quot;<br/><br/>The weight of this confession seemed to press the oxygen from the room. Eduardo covered his eyes with one hand, the gesture of a man who could no longer bear to witness his son&#x27;s disgrace.<br/><br/>&quot;I need you to leave the estate early,&quot; Stefan said, surprising himself with the steadiness of his voice. &quot;Both of you. Take what matters and go to Madrid by the end of the week.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You&#x27;re throwing us out?&quot; Emily&#x27;s voice rose incredulously.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m asking for space to do what needs to be done.&quot; Stefan moved to his father&#x27;s desk and pulled out a folder containing papers he&#x27;d drafted with his remaining lawyer. &quot;I&#x27;ve outlined a plan to salvage a fraction of our holdings. It won&#x27;t restore our fortune, but it might preserve something of our legacy.&quot;<br/><br/>Eduardo took the folder with a weary nod. &quot;And what will you do?&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan looked out the window at the carefully tended gardens that had surrounded his childhood. Soon, they&#x27;d belong to strangers or, worse, be bulldozed for development. The thought should have devastated him, but instead, he felt an odd lightness.<br/><br/>&quot;I&#x27;m going to help Camille,&quot; he said finally.<br/><br/>&quot;Help her?&quot; Emily sputtered. &quot;Help her do what? Destroy what little we have left?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Help her build something worthwhile.&quot; Stefan turned back to his parents. &quot;Her Phoenix Foundation, it&#x27;s going to help women trapped in abusive relationships, women who&#x27;ve been betrayed by those meant to protect them.&quot;<br/><br/>Eduardo studied his son&#x27;s face. &quot;And you think she&#x27;ll accept your help?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Probably not. But I have to try.&quot;<br/><br/>Emily stood abruptly, smoothing her wrinkled traveling clothes with trembling hands. &quot;I don&#x27;t recognize you anymore.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan smiled sadly. &quot;That&#x27;s because I&#x27;m finally becoming someone worth recognizing, Mother.&quot;<br/><br/>She turned and left the room without another word, her footsteps echoing on the marble floors.<br/><br/>Eduardo lingered, fatigue etched in every line of his face. &quot;There&#x27;s a fine line between atonement and self-destruction, hijo. Be careful you know which side you&#x27;re on.&quot;<br/><br/>Stefan nodded, watching his father follow his mother upstairs. The house fell silent except for the ticking of the grandfather clock in the hallway, counting down the moments of the Rodriguez family&#x27;s final days in their ancestral home.<br/><br/>He returned to the window, gazing out at the property that had defined him for so long. The setting sun cast long shadows across the lawn, like fingers reaching for something just beyond grasp.<br/><br/>Tomorrow, he would contact the Phoenix Foundation. Not to beg Camille for forgiveness, he&#x27;d attempted that already and understood its futility. Instead, he would offer the one thing he had left that might matter: his complete surrender to her cause.<br/><br/>She might reject him. She probably would. But in that rejection, he might find the path to becoming the man he should have been from the start, a man worthy not of possessing Camille Lewis, but of inhabiting the same world as her.<br/><br/>Stefan lifted his glass in a silent toast to the dying light. To endings that might, with work and grace, become beginnings of a sort.<br/>.<br/></div>
