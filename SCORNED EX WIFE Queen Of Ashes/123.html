        <h1>Chapter 87-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 87<br/><br/>Rose lifted her champagne flute, the bubbles catching the afternoon sunlight that streamed through the penthouse windows. Across the table, Herod mirrored her movement, his eyes glinting with satisfaction. On the television behind them, muted news channels cycled through images of Camille&#x27;s face alongside headlines questioning her mental state. The stock ticker at the bottom showed Kane Industries down fifteen percent and falling.<br/><br/>&quot;To bringing down giants,&quot; Herod said.<br/><br/>They clinked glasses. Rose savored the expensive champagne, allowing herself this moment of triumph. <br/><br/>&quot;I must admit,&quot; Herod said, settling back in his chair, &quot;your media contacts exceeded my expectations. The coverage is... spectacular.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose smiled, running her finger along the rim of her glass. &quot;Money talks. But so do old favors.&quot; She nodded toward the television where her tearful interview was replaying. &quot;Eliza Jenkins has hated Victoria Kane for a decade. Ever since Victoria blocked her husband&#x27;s appointment to the Federal Reserve. Getting her to conduct my interview was almost too easy.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And the medical records? A particularly inspired touch.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;There are no medical records,&quot; Rose laughed, the sound sharp with triumph. &quot;Just enough specific details to sound convincing, provided by a therapist who never treated Camille but is happy to consult anonymously for the right price.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod raised an eyebrow. &quot;Creative.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It&#x27;s how the game is played.&quot; Rose stood and walked to the window, looking out over Manhattan with fresh eyes. For weeks, the city had felt like a prison, places she couldn&#x27;t go, people who wouldn&#x27;t speak to her. Now it felt like a chessboard where she was moving pieces again. &quot;The trick isn&#x27;t just creating a lie. It&#x27;s creating one so big, so shocking that people want to believe it.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Especially when it comes from the tearful sister.&quot; Herod joined her at the window, champagne in hand. &quot;Your performance was quite moving.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I learned from the best actors in the business, the ultra-rich.&quot; Rose&#x27;s voice hardened. &quot;Watching my so-called family pretend to be perfect while judging me for every mistake.&quot;<br/><br/>On the coffee table, Herod&#x27;s phone buzzed. He glanced at it, his smile widening.<br/><br/>&quot;Kane Industries has called an emergency board meeting,&quot; he said, raising his glass again. &quot;Your sister is in full crisis mode.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose closed her eyes briefly, picturing Camille&#x27;s face as she woke to find herself branded unstable and dangerous. The thought sent warmth through her chest.<br/><br/>&quot;They&#x27;ve pulled her from the Phoenix Grid launch event,&quot; Herod continued, reading from his phone. &quot;Claiming she&#x27;s &#x27;focusing on technical aspects rather than public-facing duties.&#x27;&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;They&#x27;re hiding her,&quot; Rose said, satisfaction flooding her voice. &quot;Exactly what I wanted. The mighty Camille Kane, driven back into the shadows.&quot;<br/><br/>Herod poured more champagne for them both. &quot;Phase one accomplished. But remember, this is just the beginning.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The beginning of the end for Camille.&quot; Rose took the refilled glass. &quot;Tomorrow my parents give their interview. My poor, concerned parents, heartbroken over their daughter&#x27;s mental decline.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;They agreed to participate?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;They don&#x27;t know they&#x27;re participating yet,&quot; Rose said with a harsh laugh. &quot;But they will. My father will do anything to protect the family name. Including disowning his &#x27;unstable&#x27; daughter if he thinks it will limit the damage.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Ruthless.&quot; Herod studied her with new appreciation. &quot;You&#x27;ve thought of everything.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Not everything.&quot; Rose&#x27;s eyes darkened. &quot;Victoria Kane is still standing. That woman has weathered worse storms than this.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Which is why phase two targets the Phoenix Grid itself.&quot; Herod gestured toward his desk where blueprints and technical documents were spread out. &quot;My sources inside their engineering department provide weekly updates. The more we learn, the more vulnerable points we find.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Explain it again,&quot; Rose said, moving toward the desk. &quot;How exactly do we sabotage a clean energy project without getting caught?&quot;<br/><br/>Herod joined her, laying his hand on a schematic. &quot;We don&#x27;t have to sabotage anything physically. We just need to prove it was built on flawed assumptions.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And how do we do that?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;By revealing that Hannah Zhao, their chief engineer, falsified her initial test results.&quot; Herod tapped a document. &quot;The system works in controlled settings but fails under the load conditions of a full city grid. Zhao knew this six months ago but buried the findings to keep her job.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And you have proof of this?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I will by next week.&quot; Herod&#x27;s smile didn&#x27;t reach his eyes. &quot;My contact is gathering the final pieces. When they release the evidence, Kane Industries will face more than bad publicity. They&#x27;ll be looking at fraud charges, investor lawsuits, regulatory investigations.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And Camille takes the fall,&quot; Rose whispered, the image so sweet she could almost taste it. &quot;The unstable heiress who pushed forward a dangerous project despite warnings.&quot;<br/><br/>She moved to the television, turning up the volume just as a financial analyst appeared on screen.<br/><br/>&quot;Investors are rightfully concerned,&quot; the woman was saying. &quot;Kane Industries has positioned the Phoenix Grid as the cornerstone of their future growth strategy. If the leadership of that project is compromised, as these reports suggest, we have to question the viability of the technology itself.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Listen to them,&quot; Rose said, gesturing at the screen. &quot;They&#x27;ve already connected Camille&#x27;s supposed instability to doubts about the project. We barely had to nudge them in that direction.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;People see what they expect to see,&quot; Herod agreed. &quot;Create the right framework, and they fill in the blanks themselves.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose stared at the screen as it cut to footage of Victoria Kane entering Kane Industries headquarters, surrounded by security and ignoring shouted questions from reporters. The older woman&#x27;s face was a stone mask, revealing nothing, but Rose could read the tension in her posture.<br/><br/>&quot;I wish I could see inside that building right now,&quot; Rose murmured. &quot;Victoria realizing her perfect revenge plan is unraveling. Camille hiding away as the world questions her sanity.&quot;</div>
