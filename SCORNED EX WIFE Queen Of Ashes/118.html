        <h1>Chapter 84-1</h1>
        <div>Chapter 84<br/><br/>Rain pounded against the windows of Kane Industries as Camille reviewed the quarterly reports for the Phoenix Grid project. The soft glow of her desk lamp created a bubble of light in the darkening office. Most employees had gone home hours ago, but Camille found comfort in the solitude of these late hours. Here, in the quiet, she could focus on creation rather than destruction.<br/><br/>Her phone buzzed with a text from Alexander: *Still working? The world won&#x27;t change in a single night.*<br/><br/>A smile tugged at her lips. She typed back: *Says the man who probably hasn&#x27;t left his lab yet.*<br/><br/>Three dots appeared, then: *Guilty. Dinner tomorrow?*<br/><br/>Before she could respond, a sharp knock echoed through her office. Camille glanced up, expecting her assistant with the financial projections she&#x27;d requested.<br/><br/>Instead, Rose stood in the doorway.<br/><br/>Time seemed to slow as their eyes locked. Rose looked different—thinner, harder. Dark circles shadowed her eyes. Her designer clothes had been replaced by a plain black sweater and jeans. But the hatred blazing in her gaze remained unchanged.<br/><br/>&quot;Security didn&#x27;t mention you were coming,&quot; Camille said, her voice steady despite the sudden hammering of her heart.<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s lips curled into a bitter smile. &quot;Money still opens doors, sister dear. Even when most of it&#x27;s gone.&quot;<br/><br/>She stepped into the office uninvited, her movements jerky with barely contained rage. Rain dripped from her coat onto the polished floor. The door swung shut behind her with a soft click that sounded unnervingly final.<br/><br/>&quot;What do you want, Rose?&quot; Camille asked, rising from her chair. She wouldn&#x27;t give Rose the advantage of looking down at her.<br/><br/>&quot;What do I want?&quot; Rose laughed, the sound brittle and sharp as breaking glass. &quot;That&#x27;s rich coming from you. I want back everything you stole from me.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I didn&#x27;t steal anything from you. I took back what was mine.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s face contorted. &quot;Nothing was ever yours! You were just holding it for me until I was ready to take it.&quot;<br/><br/>The raw honesty of the statement hung between them. No more pretense, no more masks. Just the ugly truth that had always lurked beneath their relationship.<br/><br/>&quot;So you admit it,&quot; Camille said quietly. &quot;You never saw me as your sister. Just someone whose life you could steal when it suited you.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;You had everything handed to you,&quot; Rose spat, taking another step forward. &quot;The perfect parents. The perfect house. The perfect life. I had to claw my way out of the foster system, waiting for someone.... anyone..... to want me. And then I saw your family with their big house and their perfect daughter. I made them choose me. I made them love me more.&quot;<br/><br/>Rain lashed against the windows, punctuating her words with angry bursts.<br/><br/>&quot;And it was so easy,&quot; Rose continued, her voice dropping to a near whisper. &quot;So pathetically easy to make them see you as less. To make them question you. To make them choose me over and over again.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille absorbed the cruelty of these words, feeling them strike against an old wound that had finally begun to heal. The old Camille would have crumbled, would have begged for understanding. But that woman was gone.<br/><br/>&quot;Did you come here just to tell me what I already know?&quot; Camille asked, keeping her voice level. &quot;Or did you have something else in mind?&quot;<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s hand slipped into her pocket. &quot;I came to promise you something.&quot;<br/><br/>The movement set off alarms in Camille&#x27;s mind. She tensed, ready to call security or defend herself if necessary.<br/><br/>But Rose didn&#x27;t pull out a weapon. Instead, she withdrew a small silver object and placed it on the desk between them. A worn photograph of Camille&#x27;s childhood bedroom, torn in half.<br/><br/>&quot;Remember this place?&quot; Rose asked, her voice eerily calm.<br/><br/>Camille didn&#x27;t touch it. The photo brought back unwanted memories, the room she&#x27;d decorated with such care, the space that had been hers before Rose had gradually taken it over with her opinions and presence.<br/><br/>&quot;You&#x27;ve kept that all this time?&quot; Camille asked, keeping her expression neutral.<br/><br/>Rose&#x27;s smile widened. &quot;I keep all my trophies. And now I&#x27;ve come to tell you..... you haven&#x27;t won. You&#x27;ve just started a war that I intend to finish.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Is that what this is? A threat?&quot; Camille asked.<br/><br/>&quot;Is that what this is? A threat?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;A promise,&quot; Rose corrected, leaning forward with her palms flat on the desk. &quot;You took everything from me, Camille. My reputation. My business. Stefan.&quot; She spat his name like a curse. &quot;You even took our parents. All because you couldn&#x27;t handle that he chose me over you.&quot;<br/><br/>Camille shook her head, refusing to be baited. &quot;You tried to have me killed, Rose.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;A mistake,&quot; Rose said dismissively. &quot;I only wanted to scare you into leaving. Those idiots went too far.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;And you&#x27;re making another mistake now.&quot;<br/><br/>Rose straightened, studying Camille with narrowed eyes. &quot;You think you&#x27;ve won. That&#x27;s your mistake. You&#x27;ve taken everything that mattered to me, so now I have nothing left to lose.&quot; She tapped the Preston pin. &quot;But you? You&#x27;ve built a whole new life. New mother. New company. New boyfriend.&quot; Her lips curved into a cruel smile. &quot;So many new things to take from you.&quot;</div>
