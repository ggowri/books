  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Osborne's command, the Blood Demon members began their approach toward the volcano.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Osborne had already slipped into a parallel dimension, making his way into the heart of the dormant volcano.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Years had passed without a rumble from this mountain, but deep within its caverns, a network of intricate lava tunnels sprawled out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Terrence and his companions were navigating through them, careful to suppress any energy signatures that might expose their presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gathered in a reasonably spacious underground chamber were more than twenty members&mdash;the remnants of the Deschanel Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them were 18 Transcendent Deities and nine Superior Deities, the last line of defense for their clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere was thick with silence, a heavy weight of despair hanging over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither did they realize that Osborne, accompanied by Divine Shadow and God of Star, had already arrived nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Terrence broke the silence, his voice sharp and unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen up! Everyone, get your heads in the game! We're still alive, and as long as we breathe, the Deschanel Clan is not done for! We've faced annihilation countless times in the Age of Gods, and somehow, we've always found a way to bounce back and reclaim our rightful place at the top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This time will be no different!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With our survival, the Deschanel Clan will rise again! When we do, the Augustine family will be nothing but dust!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes burned with fury and determination, and his words sparked a flicker of hope within the clan members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone spoke up, "But what do we do now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Augustine family is too powerful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They have close to five thousand Junior and Intermediate Deity warriors, and their coordination is flawless. We stand no chance against them with this small group!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence snorted derisively. "Sure, the Augustine family is hiding some serious secrets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In such a short time, they've turned that many into gods, with at least Level Three Divine Bodies to boot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But at the end of the day, they're just Junior and Intermediate Deities! As we move forward, their power will plateau, but we just need to hit our peak once again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once we do that, taking them down will be a walk in the park! Junior Deities and Intermediate Deities? They're nothing but pests, mere cannon fodder! No matter how well they work together, we'll crush them effortlessly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His passionate speech left the clan members darting nervous glances at one another; doubt etched on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Recovering our peak power is easier said than done. With the rules of this new world being what they are, we can only reach the pinnacle of Transcendent Deity!" one replied, frustration evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence smirked, his confidence unwavering. "I get that! That's exactly why we need to leave this place and return to Celestara!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I'm right, this new world is connected to Celestara. Once we find a way back, we can regain our powers swiftly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When we're back at our peak and ready to unleash our full strength, we'll return here and wipe out the Augustine family to avenge what they've done to us today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he finished speaking, the place fell into an astonished silence, the weight of his words sinking in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this world connected to Celestara? Are we headed back there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Deschanel Clan members frowned with confusion and concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But before we retreated into the Sanctuary Casket, Celestara was already nearly destroyed by the cataclysmic battle between Lord Malevolence and the Deity Kings! It reeked of death, making it uninhabitable. That's why we had to seek refuge within the Casket..." one member expressed his reservations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence let out a cold chuckle, dismissing the worry. "Don't fret. We've been cooped up in the Sanctuary Casket for a millennium. Celestara must have recovered substantially by now&mdash;at the very least, it's sufficient for survival! Back then, when Lord Malevolence invaded Celestara, he annihilated over ninety percent of the deities in an instant. Divine clans, hegemonic powers, even Deity King-level factions&mdash;all were eradicated in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Their treasures are likely scattered in the ruins of Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we can return, we can hunt down those riches! Not only will we restore our former strength, but we may also surpass it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrence's eyes gleamed with visions of grandeur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He continued, "This time, perhaps I can break through the shackles of being a Deity Overlord, rising higher to become a supreme Deity King warrior! When that day comes, the Augustine family will be nothing more than ants beneath my feet&mdash;I'll snuff them out with a wave of my hand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, the entire Celestara will bow before the Deschanel Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, the Deschanel Clan regained their confidence, and each member's spirits buoyed with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They envisioned a future where the Deschanel Clan would rise again, far surpassing their former glory, ruling over Celestara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, Terrence's face suddenly contorted in alarm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, he sensed an overwhelming surge of power surging around them, encircling them from all directions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"No way!" he gasped, his voice tinged with dread.</span></p><div class="pagination">
