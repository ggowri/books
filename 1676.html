  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and Diana had already spent more than a day in this area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Angelo and his team had put quite a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After descending from Celestial Sword Peak, they encountered no further trouble, successfully bypassing the city-level Deathborn nests and returning to a safer route.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For quite a stretch ahead, they wouldn't face any formidable Deathborn strongholds. It wasn't until they got within about three thousand miles of the Celestial Crystal mine that they encountered a national-level Deathborn nest blocking their path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Angelo and the others were moving swiftly, and at this point, they were closing in on the area where the national-level Deathborn stronghold was located.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, their pace began to slow as they approached the danger zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne and Diana followed the path the others had taken, quickly catching up and keeping a distance of about six miles behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Be careful, Osborne!" Diana warned, and her expression turned serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been here before, years ago, with another Deity King's team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was in this very area that they had run into a patrol from Deathborn Kingdom, which quickly escalated into an overwhelming assault by a massive Deathborn army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, only she and the Deity King warrior had survived. Everyone else perished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The might of Deathborn Kingdom was evident from that experience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had never pinpointed the exact location of Deathborn Kingdom, only knowing it was nearby, and even if they wanted to take a detour, it was impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most frightening aspect of Deathborn Kingdom was the presence of Deity King-level Deathborn, known as Deathborn Kings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These Deathborn Kings had powerful control over their minions, and any patrols they sent out could immediately alert the King if they encountered any threats, leading to a swift mobilization of the Deathborn army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, the area surrounding Deathborn Kingdom was extremely perilous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A careless encounter with a patrol could spell disaster. If they didn't eliminate the patrol, Deathborn would report back, revealing their location. But if they did kill the patrol, Deathborn King would feel the disturbance and still learn of their presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Angelo was on high alert, his face serious as he cautioned his team.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone, stay sharp!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep your divine power under wraps. We can't make a sound! If we can make it through this area without being spotted by the Deathborn Kingdom's patrols, we should be able to reach the Celestial Crystal mine without a hitch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if we get discovered and surrounded by their forces, don't say I didn't warn you when I can't come to your rescue!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere grew tense as everyone understood the gravity of their situation. They knew this was the most dangerous part of their mission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Deathborn army surrounded them, the chances of survival would be slim, even for Angelo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that realization, they proceeded cautiously, moving silently, not even daring to breathe heavily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a distance, Osborne watched their careful movements, a smirk creeping onto his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think you can just waltz through this area and make it to the Celestial Crystal mine unscathed? Dream on! You'd better brace yourselves for a showdown with the Deathborn Kingdom's army. Especially you, Angelo. Your purpose here is to help me take out a Deathborn King!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought in mind, Osborne sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He activated Satan's Eye to scout the surroundings. To his surprise, there were no signs of the Deathborn Kingdom nearby, not even a patrol in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm? Could it be that the Deathborn Kingdom isn't close by? That doesn't seem right." Osborne murmured to himself, puzzled by the unexpected silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thick fog shrouding the area limited Osborne's vision, making it difficult for even Satan's Eye to penetrate the mist. Determined, he quickly conjured four spatial clones, sending them out in different directions to scout the surroundings. Finding the Deathborn Kingdom would be ideal, but if they couldn't locate it, stumbling upon a patrol could work just as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drawing the patrol toward Angelo's team could make everything easier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the four spatial clones were off, connected to Osborne's consciousness as if they were extensions of his own body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under his control, they moved swiftly, scanning the area with Satan's Eye to hunt for any signs of Deathborn Kingdom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this situation, if Deathborn Kingdom was truly nearby, he would surely find it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't take long for Osborne to make a breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two of the spatial clones nearly simultaneously spotted a patrol of Deathborn. These warriors were no joke; all of them were at least Deity Overlord level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no doubt that this was definitely a patrol from Deathborn Kingdom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just as I thought, there really is a Deathborn Kingdom nearby." Osborne whispered to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of his clones began to lead the patrol away, guiding them toward Angelo and his group, while the others focused on pinpointing the exact location of Deathborn Kingdom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, Osborne's efforts paid off again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, they're here! Deathborn Kingdom is less than 300 miles from Celestial Crystal Mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their patrol range probably covers the mine itself. This is going to complicate things."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned slightly, weighing the implications of this newfound information.</span></p><div class="pagination">
