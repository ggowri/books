  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne touched his face and froze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought, "What's going on?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Why did Ms. Alba touch my face? If she wanted to encourage me, she would have patted my shoulder or head.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But before leaving, she actually touched my face."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This left Osborne puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Could this be Ms. Alba's special way of saying thanks? That's really strange..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne didn't think further.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He couldn't possibly think Adriana would fall for him. After all, with her strength and status, she would never look up to someone as weak as him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the Glorious Divine Emperor had pursued Adriana, but she rejected him without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, many powerful individuals lack the emotions that ordinary people have. They are born strong and strive for higher cultivation levels and greater strength from the moment they are born. All their goals revolve around evolving more completely, becoming stronger, and standing at the pinnacle of the cosmos...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They never even considered falling in love or getting married and having children.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana is that kind of person.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And Osborne felt that he was also becoming that kind of person. When he was on Blue Planet, he was still very weak. Seeing a beautiful woman would make his heart flutter, and he would want to fall in love with her, live together, get married, and have children.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But as his strength grew, these thoughts were almost fading away.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing beautiful women, Osborne would only appreciate them, think about whether they were suitable as friends, and whether they were trustworthy, without any other thoughts.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Clara and Leroy are also very beautiful. Osborne interacted with them a lot, helping each other and facing dangers and troubles together. If it were before, Osborne would have already developed feelings for them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But now Osborne simply sees them as trustworthy friends.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He has a similar attitude toward Agatha and Angela.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's strength keeps growing, and so does his ability to control desires. His body has evolved, and he is no longer easily controlled by physical desires or easily falls in love with others.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This has its pros and cons.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Osborne already has many women, such as Isa, Clarissa, Emma, and Austin. Osborne's feelings for them haven't changed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne is grateful that he was once very weak.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he were like Adriana, born strong and already a warrior when he became aware, he might have never loved anyone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Adriana's emotions are suppressed by reason.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even the Glorious Divine Emperor, she looks down on, let alone falling in love with Osborne, so he didn't think much about it.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two days remain until the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, but Osborne is already impatient. He finds himself a bit restless. This is clearly unusual, but he can't control it, nor does he want to control his emotions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because he knows he's just looking forward to it!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He isn't looking forward to the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel starting quickly, wanting to fight in the arena, defeat all the princes and princesses, and trample them underfoot, but rather anticipating entering the Glorious Divine Kingdom's Royal Sepulcher soon!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Entering the Royal Sepulcher, Osborne can go pay his respects to Michelle.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's mother from his previous life, Michelle, was allowed to be buried in the Royal Sepulcher after her execution. At that time, Osborne only took one glance during her burial.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After that, he was exiled from the Palace and the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So in his previous life, Osborne never had the chance to pay his respects to Michelle. This is his first time visiting her grave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Almost there! Almost there!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne's body trembled slightly with excitement.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Time passed slowly in Osborne's anticipation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Two days finally passed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This day marked the Glorious Divine Kingdom's once-in-a-decade Glorious Sacrificial Ceremony. All members of the Glorious Divine Kingdom's Royal Family had to return to Nebula City and enter the Royal Sepulcher for the ritual.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The one presiding over the ritual was the ruler of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, the Glorious Divine Emperor!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In addition, high-ranking generals, officials of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, and even leaders of major powers would attend to observe the ceremony.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is a major event for the Glorious Divine Kingdom!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Glorious Sacrificial Ceremony, held once every ten years, has never been interrupted, and this year's ceremony is particularly grand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Early in the morning, the Inner City of Nebula City was already filled with a chilling atmosphere. Countless soldiers of the Glorious Divine Kingdom stood solemnly on both sides of the streets, scrutinizing everyone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The big figures appeared, dressed in luxurious attire, heading toward the Palace. They would first enter the Palace to meet the Glorious Divine Emperor, and then follow the Glorious Divine Emperor to the Royal Sepulcher for the sacrificial ceremony.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the Glorious Sacrificial Ceremony concludes, the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel will officially begin as a performance event.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As for Osborne and the others participating in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel, they are not qualified to enter the Palace to meet the Glorious Divine Emperor. They will be taken to the Royal Sepulcher first, placed in a corner, and wait for the Glorious Sacrificial Ceremony to end before going on stage to perform.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This is the status of the hundred participants in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although they are prodigies who emerged through layers of selection in the zone duel, they are ultimately beneath Empyrean Sacredness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the entire Glorious Divine Kingdom, they are utterly insignificant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, every ten years, a hundred people participate in the Glorious Divine Kingdom Duel.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A prodigy who doesn't grow up isn't a prodigy!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Too many prodigies end up perishing or failing to reach their expected potential. Only if they achieve Empyrean Sacredness Lesser Perfection, or even Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection, will they be valued.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne was looking out the window as those big figures were being guided into the Palace.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He clenched his fists tightly because among these people were many of his enemies, such as Ian...</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian is also a member of the Royal Family, but only from the branch bloodline.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he is also a general of the Glorious Divine Legion, a three-star general, naturally qualified to enter the Palace and meet the Glorious Divine Emperor.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ian is also a loyal subordinate of Hendrix.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back then, under Hendrix's orders, he subjected Osborne to countless beatings and torture. Osborne wanted revenge the first time he was on Abyssal Planet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But unfortunately, when on Abyssal Planet, Osborne's strength wasn't strong enough. Ian, however, was a warrior of Empyrean Sacredness Great Perfection. Osborne couldn't defeat him.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now Osborne's gaze at Ian is filled with killing intent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only Ian but also many others in similar situations. Back then, they were bodyguards or attendants of certain princes or princesses, but now they've all become prominent figures in the Glorious Divine Kingdom, serving as high-ranking generals or officials.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Osborne hasn't forgotten any of them.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Very soon, I'll find you all. None of you can escape!" Osborne said, trying to control his anger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Osborne sensed a wave of energy, turned to look at Clara and Leroy in the room, and smiled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "You're finally awake!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Now we can join the other contestants and enter the Royal Sepulcher early!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom, I'm here to see you..."</span></p><div class="pagination">
