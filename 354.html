  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne quickly met up with Kendra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Kendra possessed two types of special abilities and excelled in certain areas, her self-defense skills were practically nonexistent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Osborne had decided to take her to the Ghost Ship's hiding place, he would try his best to ensure her safety as much as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He handed her a set of Class A Defensive Soft Armor. This way, even if they encountered enemies, at least she wouldn't be accidentally killed in the crossfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once everything was ready, Osborne prepared to set off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Which direction should we go?" He asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cruise ship had changed positions, and on the vast ocean, Osborne was unsure of the ancient ship's whereabouts. He could only rely on Kendra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra closed her eyes, sensed for a moment, and then pointed north.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The ancient ship went north."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"North?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was surprised. The north led to the coast of Rosmandi, the direction they had come from, and also toward Dampston Port. He hadn't expected the ancient ship to be heading north.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't doubt Kendra. He swept her up in a whirlwind, ready to pursue northward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Isa suddenly appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take me with you. I don't want to waste energy. As a martial artist, flying is quite strenuous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she stepped into Osborne's whirlwind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne paused for a moment, taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had assumed Isa would follow them in secret, not expecting her to show up directly and join their pursuit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was, of course, a good thing for Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Isa by his side, he felt more at ease. Plus, carrying one more person wasn't an issue for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, hold on tight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, they flew off into the night, quickly leaving the Alisa Ship behind as they sped north.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pursuing an ancient ship that had long since departed across the nighttime sea was a rather dull task.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Kendra began to study Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa was stunning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Kendra had confidence in her own looks, she had to admit that Isa had the edge in her figure, features, and aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's cool, icy demeanor even made Kendra a little afraid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Isa's gaze swept over her, Kendra quickly looked away, suddenly flustered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne found it amusing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps out of sheer boredom, Kendra hesitated for a long time but still couldn't resist saying to Isa, "Isa, you remind me of someone my brother mentioned."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa glanced at her indifferently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kid, do you like chatting so much? I'm not that idle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra felt embarrassed, shrinking her neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't scare her," Osborne couldn't help but say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa shot him a glare. "What? Are you feeling protective? Just because you've been in love, you think you're something special? What are you so proud of?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "Where did that come from?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa's acting a bit strange. Why is she suddenly so angry?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afraid of provoking her further, Osborne quickly changed the subject. "Kendra, you said Isa reminds you of someone your brother mentioned? Who was it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra hesitated, glancing at Isa, and only dared to speak when she saw Isa had no reaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone called Night Witch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne froze, then couldn't help but look at Isa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Night Witch was Isa's codename.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly asked, "Your brother knows Night Witch? How did he describe her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra replied quickly, "I just heard my brother mention her. He admires Night Witch so much. I've never seen him look up to anyone like that. As for why he admires her, I have no idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He only described Night Witch's appearance. He said she has a peerless beauty, is cool, and distant. He couldn't forget her after seeing her once."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, she cautiously glanced at Isa again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa looked at her with a faint smile and said, "Your brother has poor eyesight and a low level of education. He didn't even come close to describing Night Witch's perfection!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kendra was astonished. "You know Night Witch, too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa responded coolly, "Of course I know her. She's a goddess."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne couldn't help but laugh, a strange smile appearing on his face. He looked at Isa as if condemning her with his eyes for her shamelessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "A goddess?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How can you praise yourself like this right in front of me? Don't you feel even a bit embarrassed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isa certainly wasn't embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression grew even colder as she stared at Osborne, her eyes flashing with a dangerous warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne immediately stopped laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kendra, Isa is right. Night Witch really is a goddess. Her beauty defies description, and her perfection would captivate anyone who sees her! Your brother was lucky to meet her. It's only natural he admires her so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you saw her, you'd worship her, too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Osborne finished speaking with a serious face, the coldness on Isa's face finally melted away, replaced by a satisfied smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression showed that she was very satisfied with his words.</span></p><div class="pagination">
