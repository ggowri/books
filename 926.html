  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everett appeared calm and collected, commanding life and death with a mere flick of his wrist. He easily overwhelmed Emma, the impending blow set to silence her forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To a top-tier Class S like him, even a strong Class AAA posed little threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Everett's attack was about to land, a figure rushed to Emma's rescue, blocking the hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne threw himself in front of Emma, absorbing the full force of Everett's strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood poured from his mouth, and he felt every bone in his body shatter&mdash;his insides were left in tatters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sheer force hurled him backward, and Osborne crashed into the ground alongside Emma, both gasping and choking on blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He struggled to rise but found himself completely incapacitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The injuries were too severe!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Light of Redemption was out of reach, leaving him helpless as Everett unleashed another deadly attack aimed at both him and Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Osborne truly felt death's chill creeping closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the blink of an eye, an old figure stepped into his line of sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Caleb!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when all hope seemed lost, Caleb appeared. In a desperate bid, he positioned himself between Osborne and Everett, using his own body to block the impending energy attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A massive gaping hole burst through Caleb's chest as the overwhelming power crushed his insides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Life drained from his eyes, flickering out like a dying flame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne stood frozen in horror, his eyes swelling with rage and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Caleb Augustine!" Osborne shouted, feeling an unexpected surge of strength propel him up as he caught Caleb's faltering body, tears streaming down his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Caleb, blood gushing from his mouth, tried to speak, every word costing him dearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run! Get out of here! As long as you're alive, the Augustine family won't fall!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Caleb's head slumped to the side, his life extinguished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Osborne felt his heart shatter into a million pieces. Tears blurred his vision, crimson hot with grief and fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had never felt much attachment to the Augustine family. After all, he had grown up without a home, a discarded orphan from the very beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His arrival at the Augustine Estate had been nothing more than a test of succession imposed by his grandfather, forcing him into their midst. His interactions with the family had been limited, making it hard for him to see them as anything more than strangers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, facing the specter of death, everything changed. Caleb stepped forward without hesitation, placing himself in front of Osborne. With his body as a shield, he bravely took on Everett's lethal attack, using the last of his strength to urge Osborne to escape. In that instant, Osborne finally understood what it meant to feel familial love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His vision blurred with tears, his heart aching with an indescribable pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "If only I were stronger! If I were strong enough, Emma wouldn't be hurt! Mr. Caleb Augustine wouldn't have... wouldn't have died!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If I were powerful enough, who would dare challenge the Augustine family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fists clenched, he glared up at Everett, teeth grinding audibly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everett, I swear I'll make you pay for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's growl echoed through the air, a desperate howl filled with rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet to Everett, it sounded like a dying dog's whimper, one that incited nothing but disdain from his icy demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Make me pay? Newsflash&mdash;you don't have a chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With an arrogant wave of his hand, another surge of terrifying energy exploded forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne had no means to evade it and was struck again, a fresh wound blooming on his chest as blood poured out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne!" Emma screamed, panic flooding her voice, but she was no better off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Injured and weakened, she couldn't muster the strength to save him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Everett suddenly halted his attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold smirk, he spoke, "Bradley! It's your turn now. I promised I'd let you kill Osborne with your own hands. He's been sufficiently wounded by me; now, it's up to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Everett's words, Bradley appeared, his eyes cold and filled with murderous rage as he fixed them on the severely injured Osborne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Excellent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bradley advanced step by step toward Osborne, saying, "Osborne, you must be feeling pretty desperate right now, huh? Hahaha, then die in your despair!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a moment's hesitation, Bradley swung a shattered divine artifact sword at Osborne's head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne, too gravely injured to move, could do nothing but stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that instant, he truly felt the presence of death. But instead of fear, he fixed his fierce gaze on Bradley and then on Everett.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bradley's divine artifact sword seemed to grow larger in Osborne's vision, closing in for the kill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, an unexpected change occurred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrible force erupted from the direction of the Challenge Peak. The power was immense and awe-inspiring. A blinding white light shot forth and struck Bradley's divine artifact sword.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the divine artifact sword shattered, and the immense force sent Bradley flying backward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, an ancient, cold voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out of the Augustine Estate! Or face death!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
