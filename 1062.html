  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Up to one hundred thousand combat drones and battle robots erupted at once. The power of energy weapons in such a large-scale war was still terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fighters of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> fell one after another. The casualties of the coalition forces were quickly brought under control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the help of countless battle robots and drones, the coalition forces surged with momentum and completely suppressed the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>' army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> suffered massive casualties. If they were an ordinary army, they would have retreated long ago in such a disadvantageous situation. But they were merely a group of clones, clones who had thought but completely obeyed Gerardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo did not order their retreat, so even if they died in battle, they would absolutely not back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo snorted, "A bunch of soulless drones. Even optimized to their peak, this is all the power they possess. In the past, I indeed had no way to deal with these battle machines, which is why I never returned to </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span>. But now...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now they're just a pile of scrap machines. I can dismantle them directly." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this dismissively, Gerardo waved his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From among the eight hundred Class S clones beside him, one hundred stepped forward and quickly flew towards the swarms of combat drones in the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The combat drones sensed the threat and rapidly changed their attack directions. Countless energy attacks instantly enveloped those one hundred Class S clones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, their energy weapons were barely enough against Class AAA, let alone Class S.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The defenses of the Class S clones completely ignored the attacks from the drones. When energy attacks landed on their defenses, they merely stirred up some ripples, failing to cause any substantial damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Death Claw."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ghost Petrification."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Formidable Punch."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The one hundred Class S clones attacked at the same time, causing the combat drones to either explode or be petrified, losing their ability to fly and attack. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, large numbers of combat drones plummeted to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The materials used to manufacture the drones were the finest diamond from the materials research lab. Even a Class AAA warrior would find it challenging to wreck them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in the face of Class S, they were far too fragile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each time the clones launched an attack, large quantities of drones and robots were destroyed, as if they were one hundred Titans crushing thousands of ants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wesson's expression changed dramatically. These weapons were the most cutting-edge technological products of the Draco Group. Each one cost dear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would not have minded losses in normal combat, but now they were being slaughtered&mdash;Wesson could not accept such losses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Retreat! Retreat! Combat drone units retreat, provide remote weapon support," Wesson ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the combat drones and battle robots began to withdraw, while atop the nine peaks of the Augustine Estate, dense energy artillery appeared. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each peak had hundreds of energy cannons, totaling thousands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cannons on each peak locked onto a Class S clone and unleashed a torrent of violent energy that struck the Class S clone at a terrifying speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The horrendous energy attack broke through the defenses of the targeted clone, completely shattering its upper body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy cannons on the other eight peaks also fired. Each targeted one clone and unleashed terrifying power, blasting clones apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After two simultaneous barrages, eighteen of the one hundred Class S clones disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gerardo snorted coldly, "No wonder it's the Augustine family, no wonder it's the Draco Group. After driving me away, you ruled </span><span>Rosmandi</span><span> for thirty years. If you had no more other cards, I would actually feel disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Energy cannons capable of killing Class S? If I couldn't mass-clone Class S Jackals, I might face defeat against these energy cannons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this your trump card? Well, it's still not enough. Today, you must face annihilation." After saying this, Gerardo issued another command.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another one hundred Class S clones charged out, all of them Tauren Kings with formidable defenses, shaking the ground as they ran. Their target was the energy cannons on the nine peaks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just a pile of immobile scrap. Knock them down," Gerardo commanded.</span></p><div class="pagination">
