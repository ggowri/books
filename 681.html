  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The current situation was almost the same as the one Osborne had faced a few days earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few days earlier, though, Osborne's opponents were five men who had reached Class AAA, he killed Duke Tauren and Duke of Blood Clan before he encountered a real siege from the three men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even his opponents were identical clone men!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few days ago, Osborne almost died in a siege by the three men. If Clarissa hadn't shown up just in time, helped him defend against Duke Titan's attacks, and helped him recover from his physical injuries, Osborne would never have won.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne wondered if Clarissa could stop such a siege. They clenched their fists, ready to attack to help Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Clarissa used her Divine and Demonic Wings again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The giant Divine and Demonic Wings wrapped her body like a cocoon, completely protecting her inside. Duke Medusa used her Ghost Petrification, Duke Titan used his giant fists, and Duke Werewolf used his sharp claws to attack Divine and Demonic Wings, but they only made Divine and Demonic Wings shake violently once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was protected by Divine and Demonic Wings, so she was completely unharmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke Medusa, Duke Titan, and Duke Werewolf were instantly shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa unfolded her Divine and Demonic Wings, her perfect face looking very indifferent at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that all you guys have?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that's all, you can all go to hell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Clarissa raised the Fate Staff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying and bizarre power suddenly erupted on the Fate Staff, surging in all directions like waves of water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's the Retribution for Fate!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa murmured, pointing at Duke Medusa with the Fate Staff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a crack, pieces of stone skin instantly appeared on Duke Medusa's body and spread rapidly as her body began to stiffen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke Medusa was stunned. Was her body petrified? She was the originator of using petrification power, and no one's petrification power could be stronger than hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now her body was petrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, no matter what she used, she was completely unable to stop this petrification effect, and she could only watch as her body was petrified bit by bit, her face filled with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke Medusa screamed in horror, but it didn't help at all. Osborne could use the Light of Redemption to dissolve her petrification, and Clarissa could use the divine healing to dissolve her petrification, but Duke Titan and Duke Werewolf had no way to dissolve this petrification effect at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could only watch in horror as Medusa's body was rapidly petrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> this is what being petrified feels like."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, a thought flashed through Duke Medusa's mind. All of her body was petrified, and she never moved again, standing there like a stone statue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this situation, not only Duke Titan and Duke Werewolf were stunned, but even Osborne was astonished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Retribution for Fate? Petrifying Duke Medusa with her own petrifying power?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne swallowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was so bizarre that even Osborne didn't expect this result.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't seem clear when Clarissa executed the trick though.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face looked pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke Titan and Duke Werewolf looked at each other, and a crazy killing intent appeared in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This woman must die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, she is bound to become a threat to the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span>! The great King of the </span><span>Aberrants</span><span> created us to help him clear all obstacles. Even if we die here, we will still kill this woman!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about it, Duke Werewolf and Duke Titan started attacking at the same time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Death Claw!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Formidable Punch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of them erupted with the unique skill at the same time, and they couldn't care about executing the unique skill anymore. Their bodies fell into weakness, and all they wanted to do now was kill Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two unique skills looked unbelievably scary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Osborne had been seriously injured, and he instantly tried to attack in order to help Clarissa defend herself against them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Clarissa suddenly put away the Fate Staff at that moment, holding a huge harpoon in her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was one of the divine artifacts, the Trident of Poseidon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa quickly swung the Trident of Poseidon, and the ground shook as if the world had come to an end. Terrifying power erupted from the Trident of Poseidon, ruthlessly crashing into Duke Werewolf and Duke Titan's unique skill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a rumbling sound, in the next second, both of their unique skill </span><span>were</span><span> shattered by the power of the Trident of Poseidon, and the Trident of Poseidon ended up smashing hard on both of their bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bang, bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a bang, Duke Titan was smashed straight into two parts from the waist by the Trident of Poseidon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Duke Werewolf was even worse as his head was smashed to pieces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, both Duke Titan and Duke Werewolf died horribly on the spot, blood spattering wildly and coloring half of the sky blood red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa was protected by Divine and Demonic Wings, and no blood fell on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Clarissa was panting violently, and it was obvious that her use of the move had drained a great deal of her strength. Her body was almost exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Osborne, a smug smile on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, I did it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can finally help you!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
