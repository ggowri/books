  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coming in at the eighth spot, Lincoln was an outrageously powerful warrior hailing from a relatively unknown race&mdash;the Battle-ascendant Warriors Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though this clan was part of the Human Community, its unique traits set it apart, making it a recognized entity on its own. Unlike Lord Malevolence, who tried to set up his Paramount Supreme Clan but couldn't gain recognition beyond Celestara Planet, the Battle-ascendant Warriors Clan was a well-known name across the Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clan's reputation was built on the back of its legendary ancestor, the Invincible Battle Overlord.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This badass lived thousands of years ago when the Racial Convergence Planet was under the thumb of a tyrannical force called the Overpowering Dynasty. The rulers of the Overpowering Dynasty were as cruel as they came. They treated the living beings on the Racial Convergence Planet like dirt, more like slaves and livestock than sentient beings. Life there was a living hell, a real dog-eat-dog world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, back then, the Racial Convergence Planet was nicknamed the Dark Planet, a place shrouded in eternal darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the face of this tyranny, twelve top-notch warriors from different races got together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They called themselves the Twelve Celestial Overlords of the Dark Planet. They banded together and launched a full-on rebellion against the Overpowering Dynasty. With their incredible might and by rallying all sorts of forces, they fought tooth and nail. In the end, they managed to bring the tyrannical Overpowering Dynasty to its knees.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three of these heavyweights were from the Human Community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was Solomon Augustine, the guy who founded the Glorious Divine Kingdom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And there was his wife, Darlene Marjory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The third one was Armand Sanders, the Invincible Battle Overlord, who was the ancestor of the Battle-ascendant Warriors Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armand had this freaky-cool ability. In the heat of battle, he could jack up his power exponentially. He called it the Battle Warrior's Rampage State. Once he slipped into this state, he got scarier and scarier, like there was no ceiling to how powerful he could get. His mad skills were a game-changer in the war against the Overpowering Dynasty, and they eventually bit the dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Armand was so impressed with his own ability that he decided to cook up a clan that could inherit this power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was how the Battle-ascendant Warriors Clan was born.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were the real deal, recognized far and wide across the entire Racial Convergence Planet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clan's always been a small fry, but every member can tap into the Battle Warrior's Rampage State. Sure, their abilities might not hold a candle to Armand's legendary might, but they're still no joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They just kept getting stronger with each fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lincoln, a real proud peacock from this clan, had now stepped into his Battle Warrior's Rampage State.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His golden-hued skin and the glowing Sacred Power were like a neon sign, showing he was in the zone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The golden fist-force collided head-on with Osborne's Sacred Power arrow. In the blink of an eye, the fist-force went up in smithereens. Meanwhile, the Sacred Power arrow kept on blazing a trail towards Lincoln at a jaw-dropping speed, undeterred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of getting the jitters, Lincoln felt a rush of pure excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go! Hit me with your best shot!" he roared, raining down punches like a hailstorm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each punch, the arrows started to lose their edge under the sheer force of his blows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time they reached Lincoln, they'd already taken a beating from his powerful strikes and finally gave way under the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha, this is the real deal! This feels amazing!" Lincoln laughed, his eyes lighting up as he saw Osborne's second arrow hurtling towards him at breakneck speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His excitement cranked up a notch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His golden skin glowed even brighter as he unleashed another wave of bone-crushing punches.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time around, it only took five well-placed punches for Lincoln to completely annihilate Osborne's Sacred Power arrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what?" Osborne blurted out, his voice tinged with a touch of shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Osborne, watch your back! Lincoln hails from the Battle-ascendant Warriors Clan! The longer they fight, the stronger they get&mdash;there's practically no ceiling to their power! If you wanna take him down, you gotta act fast. Otherwise, he'll just keep climbing the power ladder, and no one'll be able to put the brakes on him!" Clara yelled, her voice thick with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clara's warning triggered a flood of memories in Osborne's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his past life, he'd been a prince of the Glorious Divine Kingdom, poring over tales about its founding ancestor, Solomon. Naturally, he was well-acquainted with Solomon's buddy, the Invincible Battle Overlord, Armand, and the Battle-ascendant Warriors Clan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But those were old memories, and it took Clara's words to bring them into sharp focus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, so it's the Battle-ascendant Warriors Clan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne's eyes lit up as he finally understood why Lincoln's energy signature had been skyrocketing. He was clearly slipping into the Battle Warrior's Rampage State.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this state, if Osborne didn't act swiftly, he'd be the one in hot water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Battle Warrior's Rampage State knew no bounds. Even a heavy-hitter from the Empyrean Sacredness level could find themselves in a pickle if they didn't make a move quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If the stars aligned, I'd love to see just how far that infinite growth can go! But tough luck, this is a state duel. I can't afford to give you a free pass or waste any more time on you!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Osborne pulled back his Bloodwrought Bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So this next arrow's gonna pack an even bigger punch. You won't know what hit you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lincoln, all fired up with battle lust, felt the energy coursing through his golden-hued skin, which was glowing like a furnace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He laughed at Osborne's words. "Come on then! Every time a member of the Battle-ascendant Warriors Clan gets knocked on their ass, they bounce back even stronger! So I'm itching for you to take me down! But if you think you can stop my ascent, you've got another think coming. Don't let me down!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne smirked. "Let's see what you're made of!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he let loose a dazzling blast of Sacred Power from the arrow nocked on his Bloodwrought Bow. A terrifying wave of energy radiated out from it, as if the very fabric of space was collapsing. Lightning crackled all around, and darkness seemed to ignite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lincoln's expression hardened. "A Sacred Power that combines three forces? You've fused powers just like Agatha and Horace, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborne nodded, wearing a calm smile. "Just got it fused recently! And you're gonna be the first one to feel my new Sacred Power arrow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lincoln's eyes lit up with excitement. "Bring it on! I'm itching to see how powerful a Sacred Power arrow with three-force infusion can be!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he said that, his golden aura flared up, shining even brighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the Sacred Power arrow zoomed towards Lincoln at breakneck speed. Any run-of-the-mill warrior wouldn't have had a chance to react, but Lincoln was no ordinary fighter. The moment Osborne released the bowstring, he sprang into action. His fists moved so fast that they were just a blur, leaving a trail of afterimages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he started unleashing a flurry of punches at the Sacred Power arrow, landing over a dozen blows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood spurted from his fists with each strike, but he kept going, getting faster and stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a few moments, he'd thrown over twenty punches, feeling like he'd reached his limit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But all his dog-gone, non-stop effort was for nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lincoln's fists were now a bloody mess, with the bone showing through the torn flesh. Yet, the Sacred Power arrow only dimmed a little bit and showed no sign of breaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying Sacred Power arrow crashed head-on into the golden aura that surrounded Lincoln.</span></p><div class="pagination">
