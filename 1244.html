  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's expression was one of utter shock. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Pantheon League from the Western </span><span>Celestara</span><span>? Weren't you the ones who were wiped out by the God of Night for crossing him? I should have seen this coming! When that person mentioned the Mount of Gods, it should have clicked for me. But honestly, I thought you </span><span>were</span><span> all gone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone turned icy. "</span><span>So</span><span> what if you're from the Pantheon League? You were driven into hiding, fleeing from the God of Night, and now you've scuttled over to the eastern continent! You made a grave mistake coming to the Deschanel Clan's territory </span><span>to steal from us, thinking you could wipe us out and rule the world!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helios frowned at the accusation. "What are you implying? That our people went to your Deschanel Clan to steal and eliminate you? This sounds like a massive misunderstanding! We, the Pantheon League, had no idea anyone from the Deschanel Clan was still alive, let alone that we'd want to wipe you out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph scoffed. "Oh, really? You think denying it will make it go away? Just answer me this: has the Pantheon League ever considered ruling this new world?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helios fell silent, the weight of Joseph's words hanging heavily in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph smirked. "Looks like I'm not wrong about you! You do want to dominate this new world! </span><span>So</span><span> let's cut to the chase&mdash;let's fight! I want to see just how many of you Pantheon League members are still around!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helios' face darkened. "This new world isn't that big. If the Pantheon League has the strength, why shouldn't we aim to rule it? Besides, we genuinely didn't know the Deschanel Clan was still around! Now that we do, we're willing to ally with you to rule this new world together. Can't we avoid a battle?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph burst into laughter. "You want to form an alliance? Rule this new world together? You're dreaming! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just like you said, this new world is too small for two dominant powers! There's no way we could ever join forces! You're just trying to buy time, aren't you? Hoping to stall us until your members regain their strength so you can take us down later. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think I'd fall for that? My goal is to wipe you out now, while you're still weak, to avoid future headaches!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, a fierce aura radiated from Joseph, filling the air with tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helios' anger flared. "Deschanel Clan, don't push your luck! We've already made concessions! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're willing to overlook the destruction of our twenty-four Divine Families! Do you think we're scared of you? If it comes down to a fight, we're more than capable of holding our own! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you really willing to risk mutual destruction?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's laughter was cold and mocking. "Mutual destruction? You think you're worthy of that? Let's not waste any more time&mdash;let's fight! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This new world is too small for both the Deschanel Clan and the Pantheon League. There can only be one ruler! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Either we defeat you and enslave you, or you take us down and keep us suppressed forever! Let's settle this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With fierce determination, Joseph unleashed a terrifying wave of power, locking his gaze onto Helios, ready for the inevitable clash. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill them!" he shouted, echoed by the other thirty-five gods of the Deschanel Clan, brimming with murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helios' face darkened considerably. The negotiations had clearly broken down. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold snort, he declared, "If the Deschanel Clan wishes for war, then so be it! Otherwise, you might think the Pantheon League fears you! If you seek your own doom, I shall grant it! Come forth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Helios waved his hand, and from the Thornberry family's place, a large </span><span>group of deities emerged, each exuding a powerful aura, with Divine Flames blazing atop their heads. The count reached over a hundred!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph's face immediately hardened. He hadn't expected the Thornberry family to field such a formidable force of over a hundred divine warriors. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The return of cosmic energy had only been three months and counting! However, upon seeing the Divine Flames blazing atop their heads, Joseph let out a derisive snort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In such a short time, to amass over a hundred divine warriors&mdash;it's truly impressive! It seems the Pantheon League has indeed been eyeing the rule of this new world! </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, these are merely a bunch of Junior Deities. Do you really think they can contend with the Deschanel Clan? Eliminate all of you, and this new world will be ours! Kill!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
