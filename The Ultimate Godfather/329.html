  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tony, what do you want? Let me go, or my father will kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma was full of fear and struggled desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Tony still pulled her into the van as she lacked his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitch, I've wanted you for a long time. I'll show you my masculine charm today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tony's lewd laughter and Emma's struggling sound came from the vehicle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was also the sound of clothes being torn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma kept crying, but it was useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tony directly forced himself on her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma let out a loud cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, her cry was extremely stained with agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as Tony gradually accelerated, her cries gradually turned into moans with deep passion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tony exited the car with his pants on and licked his lips in delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This bitch is really exquisite. So tight and passionate. Guys, enjoy her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, the rest of the gangsters rushed into the vehicle in excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, with the shaking of the car, Emma's seductive groans came out again, which lasted at least two hours before it completely subsided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma, drenched in sweat and with torn clothes, collapsed, her face covered with a mysterious white fluid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Vito, how are we going to deal with her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A younger man just got off Emma and asked Tony breathlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Send her to our nightclub as a waitress!" Tony ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay. I'll do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, these gangsters got into the car and peed at Emma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heat flow awakened Emma, and her face was full of pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never dreamed that she would suffer such abuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tony, this is not over. When I go back and tell my dad, my dad will definitely destroy the Black Tiger Gang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Emma roared wildly in a state of madness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as soon as her voice fell, Tony slapped her in the face and said coldly, "Bitch, how dare you mention your dad? Do you know what will happen to your family since you offend Mr. Fitzgerald? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then waved his hand at his men and ordered, "Take her away! She's so disgusting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest immediately took orders and forcibly dragged Emma to another car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What awaited Emma was bound to be misery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was caused all by herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She offended someone she shouldn't, after all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't know that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he had come to the headquarters building of Rivera Construction Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the president's office of Rivera Construction Group, Mark was resting in the chair with his eyes closed and thinking about the actions of Tony and others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was supposed to be no problem, but somehow, Mark felt restless after Emma left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was not even in the mood to work, so he had to close his eyes to stabilize his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the office door was knocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come in!" Mark didn't think much and said casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus entered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark subconsciously looked up and saw a stranger. He couldn't help asking, "Are you new here? How come I haven't seen you in the company? Why are you here? "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus walked towards Mark step by step without answering him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark frowned and questioned, "Didn't you hear me? Are you deaf?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was his company. He was the boss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man had just joined the group and didn't know the rules. Therefore, Mark must teach him a lesson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus seemed really like deafness, directly coming to Mark's desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're so young yet so rude. You are fired. You don't have to come to work tomorrow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark was wholly angered and wanted to fire Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Want to fire me? In your dreams."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus drew his gun, its dark barrel trained on Mark's brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark was pale with fear and asked involuntarily, "Who are you? Why do you have a gun?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus," Marcus answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mark was shocked at the name and was about to call security when Marcus pulled the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Poof!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the sound of the silencer, Mark's forehead was scored, blood gushing out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus put away his pistol, covered Mark's body with his suit, and quietly left the headquarters building of Rivera Construction Group.</span></p><div class="pagination">
