        <h1>Chapter 180 Kingston University</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Marcus shoved another pill into Lilian's mouth, he turned to Benjamin. "Mayor Benjamin, I've got some other business to take care of. I'll be heading out now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without waiting for a reply, Marcus strode out of the ICU.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin and the two doctors stared at his retreating back, frozen in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>About two minutes of silence later, the two doctors finally snapped out of it and frantically called in every senior specialist they could find to examine Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The outcome left everyone in a state of astonishment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace, who had been practically knocking on death's door, had all the cancer cells in her blood wiped clean in a ridiculously short amount of time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from the tissue damage caused by the cancer, she was, for all intents and purposes, a normal person!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news sent shockwaves through the entire Kingston Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dean, Jason Green, upon hearing the report, immediately canceled the Advanced Medical Summit Forum and tore back to the hospital to get the lowdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jason approached Benjamin with a demeanor of utmost politeness and pleaded in a tone of respectful urgency, "Mayor Benjamin, could you please give me any information on this miracle worker you brought in? Our hospital wants to hire him as a figurehead dean. I'd be eternally grateful if you could help us out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A miracle doctor who could bring a patient back from the brink of death with severe blood cancer in under half an hour wasn't just a miracle in </span><span>Uswad</span><span> but a global phenomenon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Jason could bring someone like this on board, it would be worth any price!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several other senior specialists looked on with similar anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having dedicated their lives to blood disorders, they were naturally eager to make breakthroughs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Working alongside Marcus was a guaranteed fast track to academic glory!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Benjamin shot down Jason's request flat. "Mr. Green, I'm really sorry. He is a friend of mine. I believe he's not looking to have his personal information spread around. You'll have to forgive me for not sharing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jason was clearly disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't push it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These miracle doctors were usually pretty elusive, so it was understandable that they wouldn't want their identities out there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he couldn't help but feel a pang of regret for not having met Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Jason and the other senior experts practically drool over the thought of meeting Marcus, Hugh and Jenny were consumed by regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only had they disrespected Marcus but they had practically called him a con man and almost had him arrested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing their earlier skepticism, they wished they could slap themselves for their stupidity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A miracle doctor who the dean would practically beg to meet had been treated like dirt by them. They deserved to be buried alive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through this event, Hugh gained a moment of clarity, understanding why, despite his decade-long tenure at the hospital, he remained an attending physician.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't a question of his medical skills; rather, it was his inability to see beyond the conventional.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was oblivious to all of this, and frankly, he couldn't care less what those people were thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, he was in a taxi headed for Kingston University.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His main reason for coming to Kingston was to see Natalia and Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Firstly, he made his way to visit Natalia's school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kingston University was a prestigious institution in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It churned out elite talent for the country every year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Natalia had been a bit of a rebel, her grades were always top-notch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she got into Kingston University, she was in the top ten students in all of Solomia. She was a serious brainiac.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus got out of the taxi and stared up at the imposing, ancient-looking gates, genuinely impressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was one of </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> top universities, and it was even more impressive in person!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The students streaming in and out had faces full of youthful energy and smiles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Standing in the middle of the crowd, Marcus felt like he'd shaved a few years off himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalia, Harvey Burnett from the Burnett family in Kingston is </span><span>gonna</span><span> be at this party, too. I'll introduce you. With your looks, you'll totally charm him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Natalia. While your family enjoys a middle-class status in Solomia, it's not on par with the elite. But if you manage to align yourself with Harvey this time, you'll have truly elevated your standing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a group of female college students, all with elegant vibes and striking looks, walked out of the school gates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus spotted Natalia instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other two girls were gabbing away, practically drooling over some rich dude, while Natalia looked like she was about two seconds away from snapping.</span></p></div>
