  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ethereal voice fell into a brief silence as if pondering. After a moment, it replied, "Based on my estimation, while your State hasn't advanced to the Return Essence stage, with the combat strength you've accumulated in the castle, combined with your battle experience and the Hidden State enhancement, you're now capable of holding your own against an ordinary Return Essence stage expert."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was stunned by the revelation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had once heard Diana say that there was an insurmountable gap between the Foundation Establishment Stage and the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two stages differed immensely in every aspect, especially in combat strength, which was like heaven and earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the weakest Return Essence stage practitioner could effortlessly annihilate the </span><span>strongest Foundation Establishment expert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This disparity was a product of inherent limits, impossible to bridge through sheer effort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet now, after the grueling trials in the castle and the unexpected Hidden State breakthrough, Marcus found himself capable of standing toe-to-toe with someone at the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but wonder how powerful he would become once he truly stepped into the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought stirred a wave of anticipation within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, when will I advance to the Return Essence stage?" Marcus asked the disembodied voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Once you pass the Hidden State, you can rely on the Return Essence Crystal to attempt the breakthrough," it explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In essence, you've cultivated an additional State that others lack, granting you an unshakable foundation. No matter where you are, you'll be the strongest in your State and capable of surpassing those above it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Human, you're the first person in the countless millennia I've guarded this place to discover and master the Hidden State. Treasure this opportunity and strive to ascend even higher!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus bowed slightly in gratitude. "Thank you for granting me this chance to face the trials. Now, when will I receive my 24 Return Essence Crystals?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They've already been deposited into your Spatial Ring. Take a look," the voice replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus immediately activated his spiritual senses to check.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as promised, 24 crystals, each radiating a dazzling glow, were now inside his Spatial Ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every crystal emanated a unique, almost otherworldly energy as if bridging the heavens and the earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Remember, you've earned permanent access to the space-time tunnel. If you wish to explore the world beyond the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall, you can return anytime," the voice continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave a deep bow before turning to leave the massive castle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he stepped through the towering doors, Raphael and Ada stood waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment they saw Marcus emerge, their faces lit up with excitement, tears welling in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, congratulations on becoming the first person in history to clear all the trials!" Ada exclaimed, rushing forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes brimmed with admiration as she looked at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt there was something different about Marcus now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't put her finger on it, but he seemed even more powerful than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did he grow stronger again?" she wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought crossed her mind briefly before she dismissed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Marcus had cleared all nine trials, it had only taken a day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt it was hard to believe anyone's strength could advance significantly in such a </span><span>short time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shook her head, convincing herself it was just her imagination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unaware of Ada's thoughts, Marcus turned to the two of them. "I've obtained the Return Essence Crystals. Let's head back to the Nuer Tribe. Once we're there, I'll distribute the crystals to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, both Raphael and Ada couldn't contain their joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raphael, in particular, was elated. Having recently reached Ancient Martial Stage Nine, he was eager for the Return Essence Crystal to aid his advancement to the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Return Essence Crystal was crucial to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This moment reaffirmed his decision to pledge loyalty to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Marcus thought about returning to the Nuer Tribe, something miraculous happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a mere thought, the scenery around them changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dark, infinite expanse of the space-time tunnel disappeared, and in the blink of an eye, they found themselves standing beneath the massive statue in the heart of the Nuer Tribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This... What just happened? It's unbelievable!" Raphael </span><span>exclaimed,</span><span> his face filled with astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had spent hours traversing the tunnel and overcoming countless obstacles to reach the castle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet now, they had returned in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Ada's expression betrayed her disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, remained calm. He explained, "Since I now have permanent access to the space-time tunnel, I suspect everything within it was merely an illusion created by a powerful expert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What we experienced in the tunnel may not have been real. Once I gained access, there was no need for the illusions to persist. That's why we returned so quickly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His explanation left Raphael and Ada in awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though their experiences in the tunnel had felt entirely real, they couldn't doubt Marcus' words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they hadn't experienced as much as Marcus had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cheer erupted among the Nuer Tribe members as Marcus and his companions returned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus wasted no time distributing the Return Essence Crystals to Raphael, Ada, Elliott, Nadia, Susan, and several others who had reached Stage Seven or higher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each recipient was overjoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crystals not only renewed their determination to cultivate but also removed a major obstacle in their path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With these crystals, they could now progress from Ancient Martial Stage Nine to the Return Essence stage without any hindrance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This saved them the trouble of searching for Return Essence Crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time the celebrations began, the sun was already setting. That evening, the Nuer Tribe hosted a grand feast in Marcus' honor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laughter and toasts filled the air as everyone reveled in the joyous occasion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus decided to stay the night in the Nuer Tribe with Ada. He planned to return to </span><span>Solomia</span><span> the next day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though this journey to the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall space-time gate had been eventful, only five days had passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the feast, Marcus returned to his room, ready to finally rest. He didn't plan to cultivate tonight. He just wanted a good night's sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he lay down, a light knock came at the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come in. It's not locked," Marcus said casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door opened, and Ada stepped in, her beautiful face tinged with a faint blush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not resting yet?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada hesitated, then smiled awkwardly. "They said there weren't any rooms left, so... I have to borrow yours for the night. You don't mind, do you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus felt a wave of helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Nuer Tribe was one of the top factions in the world of Ancient Martial Art, practically a fortress under the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Claiming there were no rooms available was a flimsy excuse at best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These people really went to great lengths to get Ada and me into the same room," Marcus thought wryly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
