Mr. Fitzgerald, when will the treatment be over?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera could hardly bear it anymore, her hand clutching the bedsheet, her expression one of agonizing pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's only been five minutes, hold on a little longer," Marcus responded calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Right now, he was at a critical moment in unblocking the nodules in her breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He increased the intensity of the Timeless Numinous Energy, sending even stronger waves crashing through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Suddenly, she felt her secret parts contract sharply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She didn't understand the feeling, but it was as if she were soaring through the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her mind became utterly blank, overwhelmed by a tremendous sense of bliss that seemed to open every pore in her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A loud moan escaped her, her expression one of exquisite ecstasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Indeed, under the surge of Timeless Numinous Energy, Kiera experienced her first climax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She closed her eyes tightly, biting her lower lip seductively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Finally, Marcus concluded the treatment on one side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment his hand left her peak, Kiera felt a sense of loss as if she didn't want him to stop touching her, which brought a strong sense of shame flooding her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet the sensations were too wonderful and comforting to deny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The conflicting feelings left Kiera in a state of extreme emotional turmoil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Fortunately, Marcus soon began treating the other peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The soothing sensation that had just faded hit her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This time, Kiera allowed herself to enjoy it more freely, suppressing all other thoughts and immersing herself in the waves of sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her moans also became even more intoxicating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unsurprisingly, the treatment of the other breast brought her to a second climax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, her core was flooded, and her gaze at Marcus was no longer clear but soft and filled with desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, she was dying to be filled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, why does your treatment evoke such feelings?

Those two immense bouts of comfort were still fresh in her memory, even sparking a longing for the next one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Prepare yourself; I am about to treat your uterine fibroids," Marcus warned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera nodded faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without waiting for her to react, Marcus pulled down her beige underwear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera resisted slightly but understood that the treatment could not proceed if she kept them on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though Marcus tried to shield her privacy, the dense forest below was still exposed, and the glinting moisture within was barely visible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Taking a deep breath to clear his mind, Marcus channeled the Timeless Numinous Energy and placed his hand on Kiera's lower abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A powerful surge of heat struck her, eliciting another high-pitched cry from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sensation was even more intense than during the breast treatment, nearly bringing her to a third climax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the Timeless Numinous Energy penetrated deeper, Kiera's body writhed uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her cries of ecstasy grew louder, and her cheeks flushed with a fiery red.</span></p><div class="pagination">
