  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fuck you, you didn't pay the protection fee last week, and you dared to set up a stall. You're looking for death"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The red hair gangster Kim pointed at Theo's nose and cursed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, Kim pulled a machete from his waist and rushed at Theo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The woman, Mary, quickly ran to her child and shielded him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Theo was terrified and quickly explained, "Bro, please. Last week, my father was ill, and I sent all the money home, so I didn't have the money to pay the protection fee. Can I make it up this week?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The red hair sneered, "Make it up, right? Last week's protection fee was 500 dollars, and you owe it for a week. So you'll pay 10 times, not much, just 5,000 dollars. If not, I'll fucking cut off your arm!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then the red hair came to Theo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He grabbed Theo by the collar, waving a bright machete in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Theo turned pale with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Theo knew that these underground people were ruthless and killed people without blinking an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What they said, they would do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he didn't pay for last week's protection fee today, he would lose his arm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Please have mercy and let us go this time. My husband is the backbone of the family. If he loses an arm, how will we make a living? You have to give us a way out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mary came up and prayed to Kim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The red hair kicked Mary in the abdomen and knocked her to the ground. "Fuck you, how dare you talk about conditions? What does your family have to do with me? You are getting me killed if you don't pay protection fees. Got it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Kim went one step further and wanted to make another move on Mary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I will fight you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing that his wife was beaten, Theo was completely angry and rushed directly to Kim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, these people in the underground world were used to fighting and killing all year round, and they were not someone ordinary people could compete with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kim knocked Theo to the ground with just one punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kim's brow wrinkled, his eyes turned cold, and a murderous glint flashed in them. "You fucking asked for it! How dare you touch me! An arm won't cut it now. Today, I'm going to tear all your limbs off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kim then cut directly at Theo's arm!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The strike was merciless and packed with immense power. If it landed, the consequences would be unimaginable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, before the blade could strike, Kim's wrist was firmly grabbed by someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kim glanced sideways at Marcus and coldly said, "Who the hell are you to interfere in my business? Get out of here right now, or I'll kill you too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In this slum, the Black Tiger Gang members were like emperors. No one dared to mess with them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was exactly what gave Kim the arrogance to act so wildly</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It wasn't just Theo's booth. At that moment, over a dozen members of the Black Tiger Gang had arrived, while another dozen were collecting protection fees from the other stalls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The small vendors were also terrified. Two of them refused to pay the protection fee and were being beaten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus seemed too lazy to waste any words. He threw a punch directly at Kim's forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kim immediately screamed and was knocked down, with blood all over his face!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Theo and Mary were terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Theo struggled to get up from the ground and said urgently to Marcus, "You shouldn't get involved in this. We can't afford to offend the Black Tiger Gang. You need to leave now, or more people will come, and you will be in danger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Theo pushed Marcus toward the edge of the slum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fuck! He hit me! You think you can leave now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The red hair got up from the ground, and with a machete, he slashed directly at Marcus' back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus frowned and delivered a swift kick that sent the red hair flying into the nearby tables and chairs and caused a mess!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The noise drew the attention of the other thugs from Black Tiger Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One thug, covered in tattoos, said, "It looks like Kim got beaten up. Let's go check it out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Fuck! Someone dared to hit Black Tiger Gang members. I'm going to make him pay today!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
