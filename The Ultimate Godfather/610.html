  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada had worry written all over her face. She didn't know how to stop Millet. If he really planned to face Marcus alone in Solomia, he'd be walking into a life-or-death gamble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long moment of hesitation, Ada made a decision&mdash;she would follow Millet in secret. If danger arose, she'd step in to save him. It was the only way to ensure Millet made it out alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Marcus was completely unaware of all this. At that moment, he was in his room, focused on stabilizing his newfound strength. The Dual Cultivation with Ada had propelled his abilities to Ancient Martial Stage Eight, marking a significant leap in power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus wasn't one to settle. His sights were set on breaking through the Foundation Establishment Stage and stepping into the Acquired State&mdash;a true milestone in martial cultivation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he finished solidifying his progress, the door to his room burst open without warning. Pearl stumbled in, wrapped in nothing but a towel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced toward the door and caught a glimpse of Jane outside. That sly smile on her face before she locked the door spoke volumes. Jane shut the door behind Pearl with a decisive click of the lock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is that woman scheming now?" Marcus muttered under his breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He got up from the bed and turned his attention to Pearl. She stood there hesitantly, her head bowed and her hands clutching the edges of the towel as though debating whether to cover herself or let it drop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bath towel barely covered her bronze-toned curves, hinting at the flawless figure beneath. Her cheeks flushed red as she approached him, her </span><span>eye</span><span>s faltering with every move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pearl, what's going on? Why did I see Jane outside?" Marcus asked, his tone calm but his eyes sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pearl bit her lip, her voice barely above a whisper. "I... I want to give myself to you, Mr. Fitzgerald." Her fingers loosened their grip on the towel. The towel slid down her body, pooling at her feet in a soft heap. Marcus' breath hitched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At just 19, Pearl's figure was exquisite, with every curve in perfect harmony&mdash;soft and full where it mattered most. Her chest was especially eye-catching, standing out against her bronzed skin in a way that made it impossible to look away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pearl wasn't slender like most girls her age. Her figure leaned toward the curvy side, with just enough softness to make her irresistibly alluring. Her body was full of youthful vitality and sensuality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her flat stomach was smooth and taut, with not a blemish in sight. Beneath it, her intimate area carried a hint of innocence&mdash;soft and barely adorned by a sparse growth of hair that added to her youthful charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus swallowed hard. Back in the southwestern region of Uswad, Pearl had once offered herself to him before. But he knew that back then, she had been forced into it by her father's schemes and the dire circumstances they faced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the time, Marcus had refused her. Marcus didn't like forcing anyone into anything&mdash;unless, of course, it was someone like Ada, an enemy he couldn't tolerate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But over time, he could clearly see how much Pearl had changed. At first, she was cautious, keeping her thoughts to herself as if testing the waters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, little by little, she was softened by his presence, her guard gradually lowering. More than once, Marcus caught her stealing glances at him&mdash;shy, lingering looks filled with something unspoken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That kind of gaze, so hesitant yet earnest, was unmistakable. It was the look of a girl falling in love. And Marcus understood exactly what it meant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Jane had pointed out, Pearl's feelings for him had already gone far beyond the surface. If he continued avoiding her or pretending not to notice, ignoring her affection, he'd only be betraying the sincerity of her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pearl, are you sure about this? No one's forcing you, right?" Marcus asked, his eyes sweeping over her figure, lingering almost involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nineteen-year-old Pearl was at the peak of her youth&mdash;her beauty and charm in full bloom. Her body radiated a soft, almost intoxicating fragrance unique to her age, carrying a sweetness that was hard to ignore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Combined with her exotic features, she awakened in Marcus a primal, almost uncontrollable desire to possess her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pearl nodded firmly, her cheeks flushing as she suddenly threw herself into Marcus' arms. The soft, generous curves of her chest pressed against him, her warmth seeping through his skin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice came out in a whisper. "Yes, Mr. Fitzgerald. No one's forcing me. This is what I want. I... I like you. I've just never been brave enough to say it out loud. I even told Jane about it, and she helped me come up with this idea. Mr. Fitzgerald, please take me. I want to be yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Pearl rose up on her tiptoes and kissed Marcus, her lips trembling but determined. Marcus, already teetering on the edge of desire, couldn't hold back any longer. Pearl's kiss shattered the last of his restraint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus wrapped his arms around her frame, pulling her closer as their lips locked in a heated embrace. It was Pearl's first kiss, and the electric jolt of it seemed to ignite every nerve in her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strange, exhilarating sensation washed over her, making her tremble from head to toe, and somewhere deep within, a newfound warmth began to bloom, leaving her feeling wet and yearning for more.</span></p><div class="pagination">
