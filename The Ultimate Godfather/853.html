  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have poured the wine for you. You must drink. This is the rule here. As the leader, you must strictly adhere to it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying this, Marcus pinched Nolan's cheek hard with one hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan felt a sharp pain and opened his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus poured a glass of </span><span>Everclear</span><span> into Nolan's mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan choked and coughed violently as more than half a glass of </span><span>Everclear</span><span> was forced down his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face turned ashen. He never dreamed that one day he would be forcibly made to drink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people present were also stunned by Marcus' crazed actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard, how dare you force me to drink? You are asking for death. I must make </span><span>you pay for what you have done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan struggled desperately. He suddenly stood up, swaying even more under the influence of alcohol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, an intense killing intent radiated from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Marcus could speak, Nolan swung a punch at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan was at Ancient Martial Stage Two, and his punch naturally carried tremendous power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, his fist reached Marcus, creating a fierce gust of wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Marcus remained calm, and just as the punch was about to land, he suddenly extended a hand and grasped Nolan's wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan did not expect Marcus to be so strong and froze momentarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried desperately to break free but could not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' grip was like a vice, holding his wrist tightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Marcus grabbed another bottle of strong liquor from the table and poured it again into Nolan's mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck you! If you force me again, I will definitely kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan struggled fiercely, trying to spit out the liquor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus squeezed his cheek tightly, preventing any liquid from escaping, forcing Nolan to swallow everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan felt his stomach swell and burn, an overwhelming dizziness enveloping him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time he experienced such a feeling of drunkenness. It was unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone watched in shock, thinking, "Marcus is so arrogant. He clearly doesn't care about the Watson family at all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard! Let go of my boss!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan's subordinate couldn't hold back anymore. He grabbed a stool and smashed it toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His speed was quick, and the strike carried significant force, aimed straight at Marcus' head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold light flashed in Marcus' eyes, and he casually threw a punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the stool hit him, Marcus' fist had already struck the servant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A muffled sound rang out, followed by the servant's piercing scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body was sent flying, crashing hard against the nearby wall before he fell unconscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, another frightening attack came.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another person picked up a fruit knife and lunged for Marcus' neck. The attack was also terrifying, but it did not directly target Marcus' carotid artery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus seized the enemy's throat and then violently threw him aside as if discarding garbage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attacker didn't even have time to scream before being tossed away, landing lifelessly on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard, how dare you hurt my servant? I am a disciple of the Swords Sect. Aren't you afraid I will call the experts from Swords Sect to destroy you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus becoming increasingly arrogant, Nolan felt compelled to reveal his </span><span>background.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Swords Sect was one of the three major sects in the Martial World, a top-tier power with countless experts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The head of the Swords Sect, Liam Sky, was a formidable warrior at Ancient Martial Stage Eight, exceptionally powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan believed that sending even one person from the Swords Sect would easily eliminate Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was also one of the reasons Nolan felt confident enough to act so arrogantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't care about your background. Since you started this game, you must follow the rules," Marcus sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He picked up more alcohol from the dining table and began pouring it into Nolan's mouth again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, Nolan had consumed several hundred milliliters of liquor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to break free but couldn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, his ability to dissolve alcohol was suppressed by some mysterious force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, he was completely intoxicated, spewing unknown substances from his mouth, emitting a terrible stench, and looking utterly disheveled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon witnessing this, even Melina was terrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never expected things would escalate to this extent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan was the only heir of the Watson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' treatment of Nolan would surely provoke retaliation from the Watson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Nolan was also a disciple of the Swords Sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Melina did not know much about the Martial World, she had heard of Swords Sect's reputation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With two significant backers, Nolan posed a great threat to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This left Melina worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nolan lay on the ground, continuing to spew filth, and the foul smell filled the entire private room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone had to cover their mouths and noses, and some even opened the door to air out the stench.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard! Just wait! I won't let this go. I will definitely destroy you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Nolan was thoroughly drunk, he still slurred threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was too disgusted to look at Nolan any longer. He turned to Melina and said, "He's nothing. Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina mechanically nodded, glancing at Nolan on the floor, her worry deepening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Marcus got into Melina's red Ferrari sports car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina looked at Marcus, who was lazily reclining in the passenger seat and said worriedly, "Marcus, Nolan has a precious identity. The Watson family and Swords Sect might cause you trouble. You should leave Kingston soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Melina wanted Marcus to stay in Kingston for a few more days, she didn't want him to face risks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Melina felt very guilty. She shouldn't have let Marcus attend this gathering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she hadn't, Marcus wouldn't have gotten involved in this mess or offended Nolan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You seem really eager for me to leave. Don't you want to spend more time with me?" Marcus asked with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course I do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina hurriedly explained, "I want to be with you, but I'm just worried about you. Why can't you understand my good intentions?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled and said, "Since you miss me so much, how about I give myself to you tonight?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Marcus' flirtatious words, Melina felt her face flush, and she gently nodded, saying, "Marcus, how can you say such things so calmly? I would feel embarrassed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Melina had been </span><span>intimate</span><span> with Marcus many times, she still felt shy most of the time and wouldn't dare to say such teasing things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because I am a man, and I am not afraid of embarrassment." With that, Marcus unexpectedly started to stroke Melina's smooth thigh.</span></p><div class="pagination">
