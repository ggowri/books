        <h1>Chapter 77 In Hilton Hotel</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie ran out of the hospital quickly, trying to catch up with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, there was no trace of him. He had already walked far away and disappeared completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she felt a little regretful that she had not tried to keep Marcus before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie even questioned Marcus's insistence on holding Vincent's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had wrongly blamed him and let Marcus leave alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two had just met by chance, and although they had discussed business matters before, it was only a verbal agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus returned to Solomia, she would be helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Josie hurriedly dialed his number, but the line was always busy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that Marcus deliberately didn't answer the call, but he was talking to Michelle on the phone, discussing matters regarding the factory construction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Vincent was anxious to get a reply, Josie returned to the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Josie, where is my saviour? Why didn't you bring him back?" Vincent asked expectantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she shook her head helplessly and said, "He left, and I couldn't catch up with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent was very disappointed. "Josie, he is my savior. No matter what, I will repay him for saving my life. Find a chance to contact that young man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie nodded but didn't hold out much hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was very likely that she did not take good care of him and made Marcus unhappy...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, the hospital conducted further examinations on Vincent and confirmed that all indicators were normal, and then notified Josie that she could go through the hospitalization procedures tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, the hospital asked her for Marcus's contact information many times, but Josie refused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without his consent, she would not disclose his information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the evening, Josie helped Vincent complete the discharge procedures, and the family left the hospital happily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She always had Marcus in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dinner, Josie called Marcus again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, it was connected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a sound of running water coming from the other end of the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, where are you? I want to see you," Josie asked with a look of surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm taking a shower in the hotel and preparing to take a rest," Marcus answered casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Which hotel? I'll come see you now," she continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hilton Hotel, Room 2103," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finishing asking this question, Josie realized that she was a bit abrupt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she was a woman, and it was really awkward to go to a hotel alone to find a strange man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Josie didn't care about that anymore. She wanted to thank Marcus anyway and had no other thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I will come to you now and show you the plan I made." Then, Josie set off immediately, drove her Mercedes-Benz to the Hilton Hotel, and rang the Room 2103's doorbell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, wearing a bathrobe, opened the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the day, the two talked about serious matters and wore quite formal clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, seeing him wearing a bathrobe, Josie felt surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In particular, his bronze muscles were exposed on the chest, which were solid and full and full of strong power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please come in, Ms. Shelman." Marcus made a gesture of invitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie dressed up carefully before going out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In sharp contrast to the professional attire she wore during the day, she looked gentle, generous, and extremely elegant at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is Vincent?" Marcus handed Josie a drink and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie said with gratitude, "I came here mainly to thank you, Mr. Fitzgerald. Vincent has completely recovered."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was stunned and asked, "It's good that he has recovered, but why did you thank me, Ms. Shelman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie said, "Vincent said that a young man saved him. Who else could it be if not you, Mr. Fitzgerald?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised his eyebrows and didn't expect that Vincent, who seemed to be in a coma, was actually conscious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that he could no longer conceal it, he admitted it generously, "It's just a small favor, Ms. Shelman, and don't pay attention to it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason why he rescued Vincent was because of Josie's kindness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, it was rare to find a woman who could still take care of her husband's parents for many years after her husband died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as soon as Marcus finished speaking, she stood up, bowed deeply, and said with gratitude, "I would like to thank you for saving his life on behalf of Vincent. If he dies this time, I don't know how to face my dead husband."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she actually began to sob quietly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus knew that the woman in front of him had been a widow for many years and must have endured hardships and difficulties that ordinary people could hardly imagine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she was able to create a brilliant career in adversity, which showed the strength of her inner heart and personal abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Shelman, Vincent is already well, so don't blame yourself anymore." Marcus helped her up and comforted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wiped her tears, forced a smile, and said, "I'm sorry, I lost my composure and trouble you, Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Josie asked, "Excuse me, Mr. Fitzgerald, have you ever learned medical skills? Why did you cure a heart disease that even the hospital couldn't cure?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was still extremely shocked by his magical methods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's inherited from my ancestors, nothing surprising." Marcus made up a lie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, he couldn't tell her that he was a warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie looked at him with admiration in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was not only young and promising but also humble and polite. She hadn't seen a man as outstanding as him for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, she took out a pre-made plan from her bag and handed it to Marcus. "Mr. Fitzgerald, this is the plan I made for you. The total price of ten production lines is 7.5 billion dollars. Since you saved Vincent's life, I will give you a discount. It only costs 5 billion dollars."</span></p></div>
