  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Marcus' chiseled features, Chloe felt a sudden sense of emotion stir within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps overwhelmed by her earlier grief, she instinctively reached out and embraced Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she began to regain her composure, she became acutely aware of their bodies pressed together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' embrace was not only broad but also incredibly warm, offering Chloe a comforting solace on this early winter night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, this intimate contact stirred something within her. Even as she felt the warmth of his arms, her heart began to race uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of his potent masculine energy enveloped her, sending a flush of color to her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flustered moment, she quickly extricated herself from his embrace, her breathing slightly hurried as she tried to steady herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, I'm sorry. I lost my composure there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe said and looked down as she couldn't bring herself to meet his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's fine, really. You're very soft... and fragrant."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he looked at Chloe, her well-formed breasts caught his attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they had hugged earlier, her soft curves had pressed firmly against his chest, and the sensation had been quite pleasant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe's face turned even redder when she heard Marcus' words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew exactly what he meant and instinctively glanced down at her own figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, unable to hold back, she shot Marcus a glare before quickly opening the door to her apartment. "Since you don't want to leave, why don't you come in? It's pretty cold standing out here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Marcus followed Chloe into the elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe lived on the 18th floor, the most affordable floor in the building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a key reason why she had chosen it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her apartment was a 1,000-square-foot, 2-bedroom, 1-living room layout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though not large, it was more than enough for a single woman like Chloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The d&eacute;cor wasn't extravagant, but it was very cozy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The interior was done in a rustic wood style, with every detail meticulously crafted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear that Chloe was a thoughtful person who had put a lot of care into the design.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The style not only saved money but also had an aesthetic appeal that was easy on the eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A faint, pleasant fragrance lingered in the air. The same one Marcus had noticed earlier when he held Chloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The apartment was spotless, and Marcus sat down on the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe made him a cup of coffee and sat beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your house is quite nice. I really like it, but it has one flaw."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said, sipping his coffee while looking at the beautiful girl beside him with a mysterious smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What flaw?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe asked, curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's missing a man like me as the head of the household. No matter how carefully you decorate or how exquisite it is, it's just not complete without me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe almost spat out the water she had just taken a sip of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shot Marcus a fierce glare, then laughed and said, "I didn't expect you to be such a smooth talker. No wonder Lila likes you so much. You really know how to charm people."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have I charmed you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked, his eyes locking onto Chloe's, wearing an expression that seemed both sincere and almost irresistible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, it felt as though he had some sort of magic that made it hard to say no.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe's eyes were drawn into his gaze, and for a brief moment, she was on the verge of falling into his trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, her willpower held strong, and she snapped back to reality at the last second. "Marcus, stop joking around. I'm Lila's best friend..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe trailed off, the unspoken words clear in her warning to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus was relentless. "What if we set aside the relationship with Lila? I want to hear your honest thoughts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe glared at Marcus once again. "Why are you so annoying, always digging for answers like that? I'm not talking to you anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Chloe stood up to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at that moment, Marcus used a small trick. He released a burst of Numinous Energy that sank into the floor. To the untrained eye, there was no difference in the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when Chloe's foot stepped on it, the surface became so slippery that she immediately lost her balance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe's body suddenly lost its footing, and she fell backward onto the sofa, facing the ceiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus swiftly caught her in his arms, holding her close to his chest.</span></p><div class="pagination">
