  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was just a small favor. Don't make such a big deal out of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved his hand nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, it was he who had unintentionally intruded into the Nuer Tribe earlier and had seen Susan's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given that situation, it was only natural for him to offer some assistance to them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald first broke the Cursed Power placed on Princess Nadia and saved her from the brink of death. Now, he's saved us from the disaster that would have wiped </span><span>out our tribe. His kindness to the Nuer Tribe is as great as giving us a new life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Therefore, I believe our tribe should pledge </span><span>our </span><span>eternal allegiance to Mr. Fitzgerald, and honor him as our guiding leader, to repay his immense kindness!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Elliott spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's eyes widened, and they immediately voiced their approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew that without Marcus, the Nuer Tribe would have had no hope of surviving the onslaught of the Shark Tribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The battle just now had truly been a life-or-death struggle for the Nuer Tribe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had singlehandedly turned the tide, rescuing the tribe from the brink of destruction. His favor was akin to granting them a second life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raphael also nodded immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he and the rest of the tribe knelt before Marcus, their faces filled with reverence. "We, the people of the Nuer Tribe, are willing to pledge </span><span>our </span><span>allegiance to you, Mr. Fitzgerald, to serve you for all generations, and to follow you as our leader. Please, Mr. Fitzgerald, accept us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia and Susan also knelt before </span><span>Marcus,</span><span> their eyes filled with deep admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes flickered, and his brow raised slightly as he said, "It's no problem if you wish to submit to me. However, I cannot stay in this underwater world for long. To be honest, I came here to uncover the mystery of the space-time gate and to obtain the Return Essence Crystal within."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing his words, the Nuer Tribe's people did not hesitate and said in unison, "Our allegiance to you is not to have you live with us in the underwater world. We, the Nuer Tribe, will continue to guard this place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raphael continued, "As long as you remember that the Nuer Tribe is here in the depths of the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall and that we are forever loyal to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing that, the others all nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could never repay his immense kindness, so they could only offer their loyalty in return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, with the strength Marcus had shown, it was an honor for them to follow someone like him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given how young he was and the achievements he had already made, his future potential was limitless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They believed that the Nuer Tribe would surely benefit from following him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In that case, I'll have no choice but to graciously accept," Marcus agreed to the Nuer Tribe's request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, he had been appointed as the Godfather's successor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his two older brothers had always been keeping a close eye on him, and they had made several attempts on his life, sending powerful assassins after him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus knew that if he wanted to take the Godfather's position, he would inevitably have to defeat his two brothers, whom he had never met.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So even though they hadn't met yet, a battle between them was bound to occur eventually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before that day came, Marcus knew he had to establish a formidable force of his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Serpent's Coil in </span><span>Solomia</span><span> was the first force Marcus had cultivated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By imparting magic powers to the members of Serpent's Coil, its strength had begun to take shape.</span></p><div class="pagination">
