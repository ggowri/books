  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden appearance of the group left everyone stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every person present, including Cody, wore expressions of absolute shock on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason was straightforward&mdash;the man leading the group, wearing two wheat-stalk stars, was Commander Max Durant of the </span><span>Rowane</span><span> Military District, Cody's father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Maxine found herself taken aback by his presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone of Max's rank and stature rarely appeared in the public eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't seen this decorated war hero and Commander of the </span><span>Rowane</span><span> Military District in many years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good afternoon, Sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Max approached, the uniformed personnel immediately snapped to attention, executing a perfect military salute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Max returned their salute with a brief gesture before fixing his gaze on Cody, his face dark with displeasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, what brings you here? I thought you had a meeting to attend," Cody asked, meeting his father's stern look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I hadn't come when I did, you would have caused an absolute disaster!" Max replied in an ice-cold tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cody looked stunned and asked Max, "Dad, what do you mean? I don't quite understand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Max replied coldly, "Do you know who you were about to hit?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cody looked bewildered again and said, "Isn't he just Maxine's boyfriend? Just an ordinary guy from </span><span>Solomia</span><span> who supposedly has some military achievements, though </span><span>I'm not sure if that's even true."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Cody could finish, Max snapped at him, "Listen carefully! This is Mr. Marcus Fitzgerald, the one who rescued Commander Ashford in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>BOOM!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news hit everyone like a thunderbolt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stood frozen in shock, thinking they must have misheard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine, especially, felt her body tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly remembered how Marcus had told her he was Special Advisor before Cody and the others arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd dismissed it as a joke then, not taking it seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Max was confirming that Marcus was indeed Special Advisor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could there be any doubt?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, Maxine felt her mind spinning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at Marcus with shock and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cody trembled involuntarily. Staring at Max in disbelief, he said, "Dad, there must be some mistake. How could he possibly be Special Advisor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Max cut his son off sharply and said in an icy tone, "You ungrateful child, don't say another word. I couldn't possibly be mistaken about this. Apologize to Mr. Fitzgerald right now, or I won't be able to protect you if you upset him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words hung heavy in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cody's expression crumbled utterly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt like he was trapped in some bizarre dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could this guy standing before him be the legendary Special Advisor who had single-handedly taken down dozens of criminals?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you not hear what I said? Go apologize right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cody stood there in complete shock, unable to process the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Max's stern reminder cut through his daze once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Cody had no choice but to accept the reality of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't wrap his head around the fact that Maxine had managed to date the Special Advisor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The irony wasn't lost on him! He had just planned to arrange a meeting between Maxine and the Special Advisor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even more ridiculous was how he had refused to let Maxine bring Marcus along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now it turned out that Marcus was none other than the very Special Advisor they had been so eager to meet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking back, he couldn't believe how foolish his previous behavior had been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I sincerely apologize, Mr. Fitzgerald. I had no idea who you were earlier. Please forgive my disrespectful behavior!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Cody felt defiant inside, he had no choice but to swallow his pride, given the reality of the situation.</span></p><div class="pagination">
