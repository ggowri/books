  <div class="container"><p style="text-align:left;">Morgana and Nicole&#x27;s conversation didn&#x27;t go unnoticed—everyone present heard it loud and clear. </p><p style="text-align:left;">The crowd&#x27;s expressions shifted instantly, shock flashing across their faces.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Garrick, in particular, looked completely stunned. &quot;You... It was you? You&#x27;re the one who bought my Faust Properties?&quot; His voice trembled as he looked at Marcus, still struggling to believe it.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Even now, the whole thing felt surreal. This guy—who looks so unremarkable—is really capable of pulling off something this massive?</p><p style="text-align:left;">Even Sebastien, who was still lying on the ground, couldn&#x27;t hide his disbelief.</p><p style="text-align:left;">The sheer impossibility of it all left Sebastien rattled.<br/>Just last night at the KTV, I&#x27;ve seen Nicole. No matter how I look at her, she doesn&#x27;t seem like someone from an ultra-wealthy family. So how can her brother possibly have this much money?</p><p style="text-align:left;">But Marcus simply replied, &quot;Who else could it be?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Garrick&#x27;s expression crumbled completely. His mind went blank.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Then Marcus delivered the final blow. &quot;Faust Properties is mine now. Consider this your official notice—you&#x27;re fired. From this moment on, you have nothing to do with the company.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">As those words fell, Garrick&#x27;s face drained of color, and a wave of dizziness hit him. If not for his men catching him in time, he would have collapsed right then and there.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I built Faust Properties from the ground up! Even if you bought the company, you can&#x27;t just fire me. Without me, it won&#x27;t survive!&quot; Garrick shouted, his voice hoarse with desperation.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Sure, he was getting a huge payout from the acquisition. But this wasn&#x27;t just about money—Faust Properties was his life&#x27;s work. He couldn&#x27;t accept being thrown out of his own company just like this.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But Marcus just gave a cold laugh. &quot;Whether Faust Properties survives or not is none of your concern anymore. You don&#x27;t need to worry about it. All you need to understand is that from now on, you have nothing to do with this company.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">This was the first thing Marcus wanted to take care of after acquiring Faust Properties—kicking Garrick out for good.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Garrick&#x27;s face twisted with rage and despair. Gritting his teeth, he spat, &quot;Fine. You&#x27;ve got guts. If you&#x27;re going to push me into a corner, don&#x27;t blame me for what happens next!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Sebastien had been permanently crippled. His company had been taken right out of his hands. And now, he was being thrown out like trash. There were no words to describe the depth of his hatred at this moment.</p><p style="text-align:left;">With nothing left to lose, Garrick pulled out his phone. The crowd watched as he made a call. &quot;Regis, Sebastien has been ruined. My company was taken from me, and I was kicked out. This bastard not only crippled Sebastien, but he also attacked my men. Send someone over right now and arrest this criminal!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was plain as day—he was scrambling to call in some cavalry. Regis was the chief of police in Westpine District. He had serious power.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Hearing Garrick&#x27;s words, Regis&#x27; expression turned ice-cold. His voice was laced with fury. &quot;Sebastien was crippled? Garrick, you&#x27;re not joking, are you?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Garrick gritted his teeth. &quot;This is serious! Would I joke about something like this?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">There was a brief silence on the other end. Then Regis spoke. &quot;Alright. Stay where you are. I&#x27;m sending people over right now.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Seeing Regis confirm his decision, Garrick became resolute. Someone had crippled the only heir of the Faust family—there was no way he could just sit back and do nothing.</p><p style="text-align:left;">More importantly, Solomia Institute of Technology fell under the jurisdiction of his precinct. Based on what Regis had told him, Marcus&#x27; actions already constituted a serious assault.</p><div class="pagination">
