  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This thought frustrated Maxine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared so deep into his eyes and asked, "Who am I in your heart? Just an ordinary friend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or what? You didn't allow me to get it deeper, Officer Burnett," said Marcus with a courteous smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words actually made her tears well up because they proved all the previous fantasies about their relationship would never come true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus only saw her as a friend or a friend who had a vague romantic relationship with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Maxine had already saved a place for him in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she seldom dealt with men and had a woefully scarce knowledge of coping with romantic relationships.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, she had allowed Marcus to explore her body but still couldn't shed the shackles of moral restraint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Maxine suddenly felt a part of her missed, and her heart suffered a sharp pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This affliction, however, drove her to kiss Marcus' lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment their lips </span><span>touched,</span><span> Marcus felt as if he had been electrocuted in the face of her unexpected action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before today, he was the only one who took action to maintain their relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Never had Maxine crossed the line of a friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was definitely the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the kiss went deeper, Marcus suddenly felt a so sharp sting on his lips that he had to push Maxine away to check what happened; it turned out that she bit his lips...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you losing your mind?" Marcus couldn't help but ask her harshly with his bleeding lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood also stained her even teeth, yet her stunning face was brimmed with a smile. "Don't worry about my mental health. I just want to engrave myself in your mind. I suppose you will never forget me even if you never meet each other for the rest of our lives with this kiss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wiping the blood from the corner of his mouth, Marcus deliberately put on a painful look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It aroused her sympathy. She hurried to check out his wound and said, "Is it hurt? I'm sorry for biting you so hard just now. Sorry..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before she could finish her apology, he pulled her into his hot chest and shut her up with a passionate kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Groaning, Maxine tried hard to get away from his hug but failed to pull herself out of his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus caged her in his arms without giving her any chance to leave and then carried her towards her black police vehicle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throughout the whole process, Maxine never stopped struggling and seemed to protest inarticulately as she was appalled by his mad behavior without warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, he gave her no chance to react and threw her into the passenger seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he stamped the accelerator, making the engine roar as the vehicle dashed to the round-mountain-roads that were near the Bayside Villa located where the mountains and the sea met.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus just drove directly in that direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine, after calming her breathing, asked, "What the hell are you doing, Marcus? Where are you taking me? Are you out of your mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lingering feeling of that passionate kiss still made her heart race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he remained silent and steered the vehicle into a fork road in five minutes where there was a dense jungle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This police</span><span> off-road vehicle had extremely strong off-road capabilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Marcus' control, it quickly drove into the dense forest. Then, he stopped the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you bring me here? Is there something you can't say there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine looked at the man in front of her with a puzzled look, or to be more specific, not puzzled enough as she had an inkling of what was going to happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment she finished her words, Marcus reclined the passenger seat and pressed Maxine under him before starting to kiss her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Widening her eyes in shock, Maxine had never been treated by a man like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she kept trying to escape, there was simply no way out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' strength overwhelmed her so much that she could only powerlessly let him kiss her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, his domineering kiss turned her on as her heart couldn't help but throb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Marcus' hands slipped upward to her breasts under the police uniform but was stopped by Maxine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Frowning, Marcus sat straight up and said to her while looking into her eyes, "You were upset about my indifference to your dating others, weren't you? I'll have you right now to drive away all your worries. And I'm telling you: I also hate seeing you marry any man that is not me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he tore her police uniform apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the buttons on that uniform were all destroyed, and the white shirt underneath was revealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps because her boobs were too big, the shirt was bulging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, what are you doing? You're crazy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears welled up in Maxine's eyes as she tried to push Marcus off her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right. I am crazy. I am crazy about you!" Then, he tore the white shirt apart. Her bulging breasts bounced, impacting anyone with a strong sense of carnality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time he saw Maxine looking so sexy, which turned him on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine couldn't help but weep perhaps because his rudeness really astonished her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus didn't notice her sadness and focused on tasting her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She kept slapping his back, but her struggle still couldn't prevent him from prying open her teeth and putting his tongue into her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something similar to an electric current was generated as they kissed and spread through their bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine was so stimulated by it that she began to gasp with a flushed face, and her resistance subsided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands gradually rested behind Marcus' back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Marcus kissed down to her neck where many sensitive nerves existed. The slightest touch could make her let out soul-stirring moans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a veteran in the love field, Marcus was a master of flirting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While kissing her neck, his hands climbed up to her round and full breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the previous emergencies, it was the first time he actually caressed them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, he only touched her boobs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, however, he directly pulled down her beige bra and rubbed her nipples.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's perky breasts gave anyone who gripped them a very pleasant feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her nipples seemed to be very sensitive as his casual touch could make her let out a really high-pitched groan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her whole body was trembling. "Marcus, let me go... If you don't stop here, I'll call for backup. You are infringing on the police, do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raising his head slightly, Marcus smiled. "Go ahead and see if anyone comes to save you. You are my woman, and I will kill anyone who stops me from having you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The second half of his words was full of domineering charm.</span></p><div class="pagination">
