        <h1>Chapter 238 Interception!</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, dinner's ready."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie, wearing an apron, accentuated her slender waist, making it impossible to ignore her curves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Ms. Shelman," Marcus replied as he sat down to enjoy dinner with Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They spent the evening together, relishing their private time, both physically and mentally relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Marcus prepared to leave for Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Early in the morning, he received a call from Maxine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coincidentally, she was also heading back today and would pick him up to go to the airport.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sent her his location, and less than half an hour later, the Burnett family's business car pulled up outside Sunshine Estates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie seemed to sense something, and with great tact, she didn't go to see Marcus off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She peeked from the window, watching as Maxine got out of the car to greet Marcus. A complex expression crossed her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've been staying here these past few days?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine asked, looking at the unassuming Sunshine Estates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes." Marcus nodded casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine gave him a curious glance. "I didn't expect you to live in such a modest place. Could it be you're hiding a mistress here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few beads of sweat appeared on Marcus' forehead, and he felt an uncomfortable chill down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not saying anything, so I must've guessed right," Maxine said, scrutinizing him with a sharp gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she seemed to return to her cold, untouchable demeanor, exuding a strength that rivaled any man's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't admit that I'm your man, but why are you so concerned about what I say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smirked lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine bit her teeth in frustration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car soon merged onto the expressway to the airport.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, Marcus sensed three powerful presences approaching from afar, sweeping toward them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car was quickly enveloped by an overwhelming aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy was terrifying, indicating that their owner was at least at Ancient Martial Art Stage Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most formidable of them all had reached Ancient Martial Art Stage Four!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes sharpened, instantly recognizing the danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Driver, pull over!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus instructed, his voice calm but urgent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Burnett family's driver knew Marcus' status and immediately complied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine asked, confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait here. I'm going to take care of a few people."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said with a nonchalant tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he already exited the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take care of a few people?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine raised an eyebrow. "Is there anyone who would talk about killing so casually? This guy's arrogance knows no bounds!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Maxine knew that Marcus had the right to be arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus walked to an open area, surrounded by tall weeds, with no one else in sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come out," he called into the empty air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, three figures appeared, their powerful auras sweeping across the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two of them were Wizards, both at Level Three, surrounded by a strong magical energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader, an elderly man, possessed Ancient Martial Art Stage Four cultivation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this level, he was far stronger than Marcus had been before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus hadn't been training hard these past few days, breaking through to Stage Four himself, he wouldn't have stood a chance against them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're quite the smart one to come here and wait for death," the elderly man said with a sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had originally thought Marcus would run the moment they ambushed him, considering the news that Marcus' cultivation was still around Stage Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with two Wizards at Level Three and an Ancient Martial Art Stage Four expert, they could easily destroy him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, if Marcus didn't flee, he was either foolish or brave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't understand. Where does your confidence come from, thinking you can kill me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes glinted with cold amusement as he addressed the elder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elder paused for a moment, then chuckled again, "I may not be the strongest, but I'm more than enough to deal with someone like you. Could it be I'm wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smirked again. "Was it the second son of the godfather who sent you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're smart," the elder said with a cruel grin, revealing his nearly toothless mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then you can die," Marcus' expression hardened, and his gaze turned sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hands, which had been resting behind him, suddenly shot forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two intense fireballs erupted from his palms, filled with searing heat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The temperature around them skyrocketed as the fireballs hurtled toward the two Wizards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two Wizards' eyes widened in surprise, realizing Marcus had mastered Wizard-level power.</span></p></div>
