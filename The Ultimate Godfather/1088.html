  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Garrick erupted in fury instantly. Staring at Regis with blatant disbelief, he bellowed, "Regis, have you lost your mind? Why the hell are you arresting me? I'm your brother! What on earth is going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regis retorted sternly, "Sebastien stormed into the campus, harassed a girl at Solomia Institute of Technology, and was on the verge of raping her. As his father, instead of reining him in, you've been egging him on and led a mob to surround and attack her brother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your son has committed attempted rape, and you're guilty of inciting a riot. Your offenses are no trivial matter. You must be apprehended immediately and await judgment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Regis, I'm your brother, and Sebastien is your nephew. How can you be so heartless?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Regis' words, Garrick's face was etched with despair. He had never expected that the one issuing the arrest warrant against him would be his esteemed elder brother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't acknowledge a brother like you. Don't try to play the family card. Arrest them and haul them away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regis made a gesture, and several policemen rushed forward, swiftly restraining Garrick and Sebastien and herding them towards the police car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regis turned his back to Garrick and Sebastien, his eyes shut, and his wrinkled face betrayed helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was acutely aware that if they were not arrested, he would lose his position and even end up behind bars, just like them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In such a dire situation, he had no choice but to put justice above family to safeguard his job.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Regis had a wife and a daughter relying on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he landed in prison, they would be left in a precarious situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this astonishing turn of events immediately stunned everyone present. Their eyes were wide with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had foreseen that Regis would order the arrest of Garrick and Sebastien.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was simply incredible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Regis had been hell-bent on avenging Garrick and Sebastien.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But ever since Dustin's arrival, Regis' attitude had undergone a drastic change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This piqued everyone's curiosity about what Dustin had whispered to Regis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What on earth has he told Regis to cause such a huge shift in his stance?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana was equally dumbfounded, never imagining that the situation would take such a dramatic twist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite not having caught Dustin's words, she could surmise that Marcus' identity was far from ordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Perhaps Marcus is wealthy and influential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he is from a peasant family. How could this be?</span><span> </span><br><span>Morgana was thoroughly perplexed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was lost in thought, Regis had already stepped up to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said deferentially, "Mr. Fitzgerald, I am sorry for not recognizing your eminence and offending you earlier. I almost committed an irreparable mistake because of my good-for-nothing brother and nephew. Mr. Fitzgerald, I implore your forgiveness, considering my prompt about-face!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simultaneously, Regis saluted Marcus respectfully in full view of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, of course, wouldn't hold a grudge against Regis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was wise to show mercy and avoid extremes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Regis was sensible, Marcus saw no need to target him any further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he waved his hand dismissively at Regis and said, "Since you were in the dark, I won't hold it against you. You may go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Regis breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unconsciously, beads of cold sweat had formed on his forehead, as if he were deathly afraid that Marcus wouldn't forgive him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Marcus was someone even Benjamin treated with respect. Compared to Marcus, he, a lowly director of the public station, was likely no more significant than an ant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus refused to forgive him, Regis would lose his job and might spend the rest of his life in prison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regis couldn't help but feel a creeping sense of dread.</span></p><div class="pagination">
