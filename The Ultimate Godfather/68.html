        <h1>Chapter 67 Kiss You</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, Marcus grabbed Yvonne's hand, whose body trembled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did she wake up from the shock just now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo's spirit completely collapsed, and he kept begging for mercy, "I won't dare to do it again. I won't dare to do it next time. Please don't kill me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apologize and call me Master, and I will spare your life. Otherwise, you will end up like Haley," continued Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo apologized and said to Marcus, "I'm so sorry, Master."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus pushed Leo's forehead hard, his eyes full of sarcasm. "Remember. Next time you see me, you must call me Master. Otherwise, I will beat you every time I see you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he took Yvonne's hand and walked out of the nightclub.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hearts of those present kept frantically beating as Marcus had just completely shocked them with his series of performances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a conflict, Haley, the heir of TreatMed Pharmaceuticals, was shot to death, and Leo, the member of the Brown family in Kingston, apologized and called Marcus "Master".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who in the Solomia could do such a crazy and arrogant thing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus and Yvonne leave, Jalen also left with his henchmen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen was quite satisfied with his performance this time. He knew that he would be highly valued as long as he could make Marcus happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because of his actions today that Jalen was about to reach the peak of his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only seeing that everyone had left did Leo dare to get up from the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His legs were shaking, but he roared angrily, "Marcus, just wait for me. I will chop you into pieces and throw you into the sea to feed the fish."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus didn't know this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not that he didn't dare to kill Leo, but he had no interest in such a coward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he was walking on the street holding Yvonne's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne still hadn't recovered from the shock, and her eyes, looking at Marcus, changed a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, thank you. You saved me again today." After a long while, Yvonne could not help but speak. She raised her face, and her big, watery eyes showed tenderness and admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Yvonne had been cranky before, she was now as docile as a sheep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Women all admired strong men, and Marcus' strong performance today completely conquered Yvonne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't thank me. You're my girlfriend. Who else should I help if I don't help you?" smiled Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who wants to be your girlfriend? I haven't agreed yet." Yvonne blushed and pretended to be reserved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' expression changed. He let go of Yvonne's hand and said, "Since you don't agree, I'm leaving now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he turned around and left without any more lingering feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, stop." However, just as Marcus turned around, Yvonne hugged him from behind, with her soft body pressed against his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus could even feel the elastic softness of Yvonne's breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held Yvonne's hands tightly, turned around, and looked into her eyes. "Did you agree?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're so bad!" Yvonne seemed very embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was just about to say something, but Marcus' handsome face gradually enlarged in her sight. Then, he kissed her red lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne closed her eyes instinctively. She felt as if her body had been electrocuted, and her mind went blank!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never had such close contact with a man before, and her movements were unfamiliar. But that feeling made her intoxicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just when Yvonne was about to concentrate on enjoying this wonderful moment, Marcus left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bad guy. You are so bad! How could kiss me?" said Yvonne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clenched her fists and punched on Marcus' chest. Her delicate face flushed, and her breathing became a little rapid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus' sudden separation left her feeling a bit unsatisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm your boyfriend. Isn't it normal for me to kiss you?" said Marcus casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You require my consent." Yvonne waved her fist in protest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Marcus is the first person who dare to do this to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't say anything. He just picked up Yvonne and walked towards a dark alley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, what are you doing? Let me go. Don't do this." Yvonne struggled hard, but Marcus was unmoved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He pushed Yvonne's body against the wall, kissed her hard, and put his hand under her skirt.</span></p></div>
