  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet now, Marcus was proof that they could coexist in a single individual. It was terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smirked coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't need to worry about who I am," he said. "Now tell me&mdash;do you finally believe me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thorne's face twisted with despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was supposed to be a simple dinner. Yet, by the end of it, he had lost everything. His job was gone. His father was ruined. He had dug his own grave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A single night had completely destroyed his life. He felt nothing but overwhelming regret. He wished he could turn back time, take back every smug remark, every condescending glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, meanwhile, had already lost interest in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Chloe and said, "This dinner is beyond boring. Let's get out of here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe nodded mechanically, still overwhelmed by everything that had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, Marcus took her hand and led her out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe followed him without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet inside, her thoughts were in chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time she thought she had finally grasped the extent of Marcus' power, he shattered her expectations yet again. Every time she thought she had finally understood him, he revealed a whole new layer of mystery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't just the head of a billion-dollar tech empire&mdash;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had deep ties to the military, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who exactly was Marcus Fitzgerald?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but feel like he was... invincible. Like there was nothing in this world he couldn't control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting inside Marcus' Aston Martin, Chloe looked at him apologetically and murmured, "Marcus, I'm really sorry. I feel like I've caused you so much trouble tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus simply chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How many times do I have to tell you?" he said. "It's not trouble. It was just a minor inconvenience&mdash;dealing with a nobody like him was nothing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, back in the banquet hall, Eulalia and Isolde finally snapped out of their daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time that night, they felt a deep sense of guilt toward Chloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As her immediate family, they had spent the entire evening mocking her, belittling her, and siding against her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, after witnessing Marcus' absolute dominance, they realized just how foolish they had been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had treated a man worth trillions like he was some lowly extra on a film set.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking back, it was laughable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thorne, on the other hand, was completely broken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mind had snapped under the weight of what had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after regaining some sense, he began muttering nonsense&mdash;his words disjointed and irrational, like a man on the verge of a complete mental breakdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shock had been too much for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not wanting to take any risks, Eulalia and Isolde immediately called Thorne's family, telling them to come pick him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What happened afterward was no longer their concern. But one thing was certain&mdash;tonight's events had left an irreversible mark on everyone involved. And as for Marcus and Chloe? Their relationship had just taken another step forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they returned to Sunridge Estates, Marcus wasted no time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With burning desire, he pinned Chloe beneath him, claiming her without restraint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe gave herself to him completely, no longer holding back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, they made love six times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each time lasted over an hour, their bodies entwined in endless passion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the end, Chloe had passed out from sheer exhaustion&mdash;her body completely spent from the pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Marcus? He still wasn't done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately activated Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, beginning a rapid transformation of his body. With the aid of several pills, Marcus' cultivation became increasingly stable, steadily pushing forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, just before dawn, he successfully broke through to Acquired State Six!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon achieving this cultivation breakthrough, Marcus' strength skyrocketed once again, reaching an entirely new level.</span></p><div class="pagination">
