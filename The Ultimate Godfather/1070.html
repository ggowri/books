  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thorne laughed, completely elated, as if he had already won.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most people in the industry had no idea who his parents were. Even those who had known him for years didn't realize his father held such a powerful position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus hadn't pissed him off to this extent, Thorne never would have revealed this information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing his words, Eulalia and Isolde were completely dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially Isolde&mdash;she had known Thorne for years, yet she had never known his father was a high-ranking customs official.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This completely changed everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Marcus was the head of SiliconWave Technologies, he would still be at a major disadvantage now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chloe, I'll admit I misjudged your boyfriend," Eulalia said, shaking her head. "But why is he being so stubborn? Thorne literally begged him for a second chance, and he refused. And now? He probably never imagined Thorne's father had this kind of power, huh? A 100% increase in tariffs&mdash;that was going to be a hundred-billion-dollar loss per year. Tell me, Chloe, is that a big deal or a small one? Honestly, I think this just proves a point. No matter how rich or powerful you are, you shouldn't be so arrogant. Because when you act too cocky, you end up shooting yourself in the foot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isolde immediately agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, you're absolutely right," she said. "Let's see how he gets himself out of this one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, both she and Eulalia turned their gazes toward Marcus, eager to see how he would respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Chloe's expression darkened. She hadn't expected Thorne to pull a move like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A 100% tariff increase wasn't just a minor inconvenience&mdash;it was a massive financial blow. And as long as SiliconWave Technologies continued operating, they'd be stuck paying double on all imports. The losses would be astronomical.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling guilty, Chloe lowered her gaze and murmured apologetically, "Marcus, I'm really sorry. This is all because of me... If I had known things would turn out like this, I never would have let you come with me tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Marcus could respond, Thorne burst into laughter again. "Regretting it now?" he sneered. "Well, too bad! You had your chance. But since you chose to screw me over, now you get to watch me screw you over in return! Your company is about to bleed billions, all because you pissed off the wrong guy. So tell me&mdash;who's laughing now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus didn't even glance at Thorne. Instead, he turned to Chloe and said calmly, "Don't worry. Not just here in Solomia&mdash;even in Kingston, no one has the power to touch my company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thorne's smug expression faltered for a moment, before twisting into a mocking grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where the hell do you get your confidence from?" he scoffed. "If you're so sure I can't touch your company, then I'd love to see what you do next."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus simply smirked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll see," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, Marcus dialed his assistant, Lydia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, how can I help you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lydia's soft, professional voice came through the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Investigate a senior official at the Customs Department&mdash;last name Winslow. Get back to me as soon as you have information."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood, Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lydia swiftly got to work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Five minutes later, his phone rang again.</span><br><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I've found him. His name is Magnus Winslow, Deputy Director of the Customs Department.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus left the call open and then turned to Thorne. "Your father's name is Magnus, isn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thorne nodded smugly. "That's right. Why are you asking? You think you can pull some strings and get my father to reverse the tariff increase? Keep dreaming! That's never going to happen. You messed with me, and now you're going to pay the price!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he had the confirmation, Marcus didn't even bother responding to Thorne.</span><br><span>Instead, he turned back to Lydia and said, "Investigate Magnus Winslow immediately. If you find any evidence of bribery, embezzlement, or misconduct, report him to the Customs Bureau and launch a full-scale investigation into him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood, Mr. Fitzgerald. I'll take care of it right away," Lydia responded before hanging up the call.</span></p><div class="pagination">
