        <h1>Chapter 970 Moral Coercion-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Marcus knew that if this woman really wanted to, she could paint him as a trespasser with bad intentions, simply for stepping foot into the girls' dormitory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as things were getting tense, a familiar figure appeared at the top of the dormitory stairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole, her hair tied in a ponytail and still wearing her school uniform, made her way down.</span><br><span>When she saw Marcus standing with Morgana Valmont, her large, beautiful eyes blinked in surprise. "Ms. Valmont... you and my brother?" she asked, confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Nicole, Marcus and her strict homeroom teacher were from two completely different worlds&mdash;they shouldn't have any reason to interact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as she came down the stairs, she had overheard bits of their conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mind short-circuited for a moment&mdash;what exactly was going on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole knew Morgana's personality all too well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her teacher was a stickler for rules, someone who followed policies to the letter, and she never let anything slide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And from the way Marcus had been speaking, it sounded like he had actually gotten into trouble with Morgana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That worried Nicole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because if there was one thing she knew about Marcus, it was that once he got stubborn, he feared nothing and no one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If these two butted heads, there was no telling how bad it could get.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nicole, don't worry," Marcus quickly explained. "Ms. Valmont and I just had a little misunderstanding&mdash;nothing serious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Morgana immediately cut in. "This is not just a misunderstanding," she said firmly. "This is a serious offense. This is a girls' dormitory&mdash;no men are allowed inside, under any circumstances. What you did was a major violation of school policy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus rolled his eyes, deciding it wasn't worth arguing with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole, however, shot him a look, signaling him not to escalate things further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she flashed Morgana a polite smile and quickly said, "Ms. Valmont, this was my fault. I thought the dorms were practically empty, so I asked my brother to help me move my stuff. I was busy packing, so I didn't hear my phone ringing&mdash;that's why it looked like he was coming in without permission."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana narrowed her eyes and then nodded slightly. "Next time, be more careful," she said. "If you need help moving things, you need to report it to dorm management first. Otherwise, it's still a violation of the rules."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Understood, Ms. Valmont." Nicole nodded obediently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she shot Marcus another look, urging him to go upstairs and grab her things while Morgana was no longer pressing the issue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Nicole's reaction, Marcus could tell that this teacher was the type who made everything more complicated than necessary. So, the best approach?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Avoid conflict and get out of here as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Marcus was about to head upstairs, a group of men suddenly barged into the dormitory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their arms covered in tattoos, their hair dyed in garish colors, and their entire demeanor radiating street-thug arrogance, these men looked completely out of place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell are you?" Morgana snapped, her face twisting in anger. "This is a girls' dormitory&mdash;outsiders are not allowed! Leave immediately!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to Marcus&mdash;who had at least entered the building with a legitimate reason&mdash;these guys were outright trespassing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as Morgana finished speaking, one of the men&mdash;clearly not in the mood for arguments&mdash;slapped her across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact sent Morgana staggering backward, nearly falling to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A deep red mark immediately formed on her pale, delicate face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut the fuck up, bitch," the man sneered. "Who the hell do you think you're talking to? This is just some shitty university dorm&mdash;I'll go wherever the fuck I want. You're telling me to leave? You must have a death wish."</span></p></div>
