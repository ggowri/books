  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the head of the Uswad First Family, Jasper was, of course, an exceptionally wise individual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Oliver's words were meant to undermine others and deflate their spirit, Jasper didn't immediately explode in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Instead, he calmly turned to Oliver and asked, "Oliver, do you know this person?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver took a deep breath and explained in detail the events from that day when Solomia had captured Auber, the leader of the Black Hawk Legion, as well as Josiah's actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A serious expression appeared on Jasper's face. "So, you're saying that the person who killed Xander and his family is Mr. Death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver nodded with quiet certainty. "He's young, yet possesses immense power. There's only one person who fits that description."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jasper paced back and forth in the room, before finally pausing and taking a deep breath. "I trust your judgment. We'll proceed as you suggest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though Oliver was not his son, he was the chosen heir to the family leadership, selected by his father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jasper couldn't dismiss Oliver's opinions lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once Jasper had agreed with his assessment, Oliver left the room, satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite his strong suspicion that Marcus was the killer, Oliver felt no hatred toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was simple&mdash;he understood Xander's family too well. Xander's family had always been reckless, their personalities abrasive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Marcus' low-key, calm nature, it was clear that Xander's family had provoked him first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the end, their deaths were merely a consequence of their own actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus, however, remained unaware of the reactions following Xander's family's deaths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had returned to Bayside Villa, where he relaxed in comfort, taking a long, soothing bath before sinking into the couch with a cigarette in hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Nearby, Pearl, ever attentive, massaged Marcus' shoulders. It was a rare moment when he wasn't focused on training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Meanwhile, in the heart of Uswad's Ancient Martial Arts sects, things were much more tense. The Astral Serpent Order, one of the three major factions, was in turmoil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Soul Lamps of two prominent elders had shattered, a sign of grave news. Even Phoenix, the normally composed and cautious leader of the Order, could no longer stay still.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Determined to get to the bottom of it, Phoenix decided to personally investigate the deaths, and if necessary, take action to avenge the fallen Asher and the two elders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next morning, Marcus set out early to visit Serpent's Coil and check on the progress of Jalen and the others' training.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, as his car neared a bustling shopping plaza, the noise of a crowd caught his attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus instinctively pulled over, stepping out and standing on a flower bed to observe the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To his surprise, a fighting ring had been set up in the center, and inside, a Crankhurst man was engaged in combat with a woman dressed in modern martial arts gear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under normal circumstances, such an arena was typically rented by local fighting clubs for promotional purposes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Anyone could register to compete, and while it was meant for entertainment, the fighters were supposed to wear protective gear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But here, neither the Crankhurstian man nor the woman wore any protection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their battle was intense, brutal, and clearly not staged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Go Shannon! Take him down! Show that Crankhurstian what Uswad's made of!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd cheered with fervor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From their reaction, it was clear that the Crankhurstian in the ring had earned their disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus squinted, his gaze sharpening as he recognized the man in the ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Easton, a member of the Griffin family from Crankhurst, who had once come to Benjamin's house with his father Terry, his uncle Zane, and his sister Charlotte.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Back then, Easton had tried to challenge Marcus in an attempt to showcase Crankhurst's might but had been easily defeated, leaving in disgrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It seemed their paths had crossed once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ha! Uswad's weakling, you're no match for me. Why don't you just admit defeat now?" Easton sneered, fully in control of the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shannon Jarvis, the woman in the ring, had nothing left but defense; she struggled to keep up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stop talking and show me what you've got!" Shannon clenched her jaw, fists flying toward Easton's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Easton scoffed, grabbing her wrist with ease, swinging her violently to the side. Shannon staggered backward, barely managing to keep from falling out of the ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ha ha ha! Is this all Uswad has to offer? A woman fighting for their honor? What a joke!" Easton's arrogance knew no bounds, and despite the furious glares from the crowd, he only grew bolder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Shannon, enraged, lunged at him, delivering a powerful kick aimed at his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Easton didn't even flinch. With a cruel grin, he took the full force of her kick, and with a forceful push, Shannon was sent sprawling to the ground, her body crashing heavily. She had no strength left to rise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd's anger erupted in a wave of frustrated shouts, but no one dared to challenge Easton directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had already won over ten matches that day, and no one was capable of defeating him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
