        <h1>Chapter 35 A Dragnet!</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an abandoned factory on the eastern outskirts of the city, Richard and his family were held captive, bound to stone pillars by Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Davis, Marcus is a well-known dutiful son. He'll definitely come for them," Felix said, bowing respectfully to Brandon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon nodded and grinned. "Good. After I kill Marcus, I'll make you the general manager of Golden Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson, fearing he'd be left out, hastily stepped forward. "Mr. Davis, don't forget about me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson knew Cedars Villas better than anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was his knowledge that had helped Felix successfully capture Richard and his family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, there's plenty in it for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon made a promise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Mr. Davis!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson bowed deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of relief washed over him at the thought of Marcus's impending demise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melinda, tears streaming down her face, pleaded, "My son has been a good boy his whole life. He won't defy you. If you're going to kill someone, kill me and let him go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her heart, Marcus's life meant more than her own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard nodded vigorously in agreement. "As long as you let my children go, you can tear me into pieces!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix wore a cruel smile. "You think you're worth that much? If it weren't for luring Marcus here, I wouldn't waste my time on you old fools!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He motioned to the thugs beside him. "Beat them until they shut up. Their whining is annoying."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several thugs complied, raining blows on Richard and Melinda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within moments, Richard and Melinda lost consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their daughter, Nicole, had avoided this nightmare by being away at college.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before making his move, Brandon had conducted a thorough investigation of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing that Marcus was likely a warrior, Brandon had left nothing to chance, ensuring that a tight net of death awaited Marcus at the factory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus drove his Ferrari to the gates of the abandoned factory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two armed guards spotted him immediately and raised their guns without a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus was faster. He whipped out a submachine gun and fired with deadly precision. The silencer made a soft puffing sound as the two men fell, riddled with bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly grabbed their guns and found two grenades on their belts, which he also confiscated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He moved swiftly into the factory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before arriving, Marcus had already grasped a clear understanding of the situation at hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was aware that the adversary was baiting him into a trap, undoubtedly having made ample preparations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This abandoned factory was nothing less than a meticulously laid dragnet of traps!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being a warrior at the primordial ascension stage of Stage One, Marcus knew better than to underestimate his enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kept his focus sharp, using every piece of cover the factory offered, advancing cautiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone's coming! Take him out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The security was tighter than Marcus had anticipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could even enter, he was spotted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the voice rang out, gunfire erupted from several directions, with bullets immediately targeting him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't flinch. Dodging bullets was second nature, and with the cover of the factory, he was nearly untouchable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His submachine gun sang in his hands, dispatching his enemies silently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than two seconds, the silencers whispered death, and several shooters lay dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus advanced swiftly, and more armed men emerged, unleashing a hail of bullets as dense as a downpour!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus darted between covers, using the terrain to shield himself from the relentless hail of bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled a grenade from his belt and lobbed it into a cluster of enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The explosion sent bodies flying, reducing them to nothing more than a bloody pulp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simultaneously, he rolled and maneuvered his body to another strategic vantage point for shooting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three men armed with heavy machine guns stood before him, ready to open fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus squeezed the trigger, and the submachine gun's bullets tore through the chests of several adversaries!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grabbing one of the heavy machine guns, Marcus unleashed a torrent of fire at another group of attackers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were at least a dozen armed men, their weapons raised, poised for retaliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the heavy machine gun was a weapon of devastation. Its high-caliber rounds tore through their defenses as if they were made of paper. The enemy's cover was shredded in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For more than ten minutes, the battle raged. The factory yard was soon littered with fallen enemies, and the air reeked of gunpowder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Throughout this onslaught, Marcus killed his foes with ruthless efficiency, culminating when he killed a sniper with a flying knife through the neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every single ambusher lying in wait within the abandoned factory yard was taken down by Marcus alone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood at the center. But just as he was about to breach the main building, the sound of clapping shattered the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon, dressed in a black windbreaker, emerged from the shadows, flanked by his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised the heavy machine gun and aimed it squarely at Brandon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impressive," Brandon said calmly. "You actually managed to get through my dragnet. Most men wouldn't have made it past the first wave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at Felix and Jackson. In an instant, the pieces fell into place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice was cold. "Where are my parents? What have you done with them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Brandon sneered, "No need to rush. We can play a little game first. Then, if you're still standing, maybe I'll tell you where they are."</span></p></div>
