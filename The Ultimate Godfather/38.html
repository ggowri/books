  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was in that split second, when Brandon unleashed Wood Attribute Power that Marcus saw his opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vine-like tentacles shot toward Marcus, and instead of dodging, Marcus allowed them to coil around his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon sneered, believing that Marcus was finally giving up, ready to concede defeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a burst of speed, Brandon closed the distance, pouring every ounce of his strength into what he thought would be the final blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as he drew near, Marcus's body erupted with a terrifying force of fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flames roared to life and seemed to scorch the very air. The vines that bound Marcus were instantly set ablaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since the vines were essentially an extension of Brandon's own body, Brandon felt the searing pain as if it were his own flesh burning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible? How did I not know you had the Fire Attribute Power? I checked your background! There was nothing about this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon screamed, thrashing in agony as he tried desperately to extinguish the flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But these weren't ordinary flames. The temperature was magnitudes higher than any normal fire, and with so many flammable objects around, it was an inferno waiting to happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fire could conquer wood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Brandon had the misfortune of facing Marcus, a freakish combination of fire and martial prowess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus scoffed, too done with playing games. He waved his hand, and a fresh wave of flames erupted from nowhere, crashing down on Brandon's already burning form.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fire fed on Brandon, accelerating into an uncontrollable blaze within seconds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brandon rolled on the ground in sheer panic, trying to smother the flames, but it was no use.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a matter of moments, his struggles stopped. His body was reduced to a pile of ash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix and Jackson, watching from a distance, felt their hearts nearly leap out of their chests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As ordinary men, they had never witnessed a battle between warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The clash between Marcus and Brandon unfolded like a scene straight out of a blockbuster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only after Brandon's body had completely turned to ash did Marcus exhale slowly, relief washing over him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The duel was nothing short of electrifying. Even though he emerged as the victor in the end, his injuries were severe, a testament to the ferocity of the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had Brandon not mastered the Wood Attribute Power but wielded a different element instead, Marcus might have been the one dead on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This fight had given him clarity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a breakthrough in his cultivation, he couldn't hope to match those above Ancient Martial Stage Two. He had been lucky this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following Brandon's demise, Marcus stumbled upon something unexpectedly radiant amidst the ashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He walked over and found a ring with gemstones embedded in it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after being subjected to the scorching intensity of such formidable flames, the ring retained its lustrous sheen, as pristine and sparkling as if it were newly forged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew at once that this was no ordinary ring. He bent down and picked it up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix and Jackson, their courage shattered, seized the moment to slip away unnoticed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop," Marcus growled, sensing their movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was not about to grant them any leeway.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They froze in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson, realizing he was as good as dead either way, decided to make a run for it. With a burst of speed, he dashed toward the exit of the abandoned factory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whoosh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised his foot and kicked a dagger lying on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blade flew like lightning, embedding itself deep into Jackson's back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jackson's body jolted to a halt. He turned to look back at Marcus in a mix of shock and disbelief before he crumpled to the ground, devoid of life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's your turn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus turned his cold gaze to Felix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Marcus looked like death incarnate as he was covered in blood, his eyes burning with a fierce intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix was petrified to the point of losing control of his bladder, his body crumpling to the ground in sheer terror. "Marcus, I swear, Brandon made me do it! It wasn't my idea! Spare me, and I'll serve you. I'll be your slave!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't even hesitate. He reached down and grabbed the heavy machine gun lying on the ground, his fingers instantly finding the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix didn't even have time to scream. His body jerked violently under the onslaught. Within seconds, he was dead, lying in a pool of his own blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' parents were his ultimate vulnerability. Anyone daring enough to threaten them would find Marcus ready to lay down his life in lethal retribution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sprinted deeper into the factory and finally found Richard and Melinda, who were tied to stone pillars, their bodies bruised and bloody.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus rushed forward and immediately began to circulate Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, injecting Numinous Energy into their bodies to stabilize them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After several agonizing moments, Richard and Melinda stirred, their eyelids fluttering open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus? Is that you? Run! The people who did this will come back. You need to get out of here! We'll hold them off!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in his injured state, Richard's first thought was to sacrifice himself to protect his son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was moved as he quickly untied them. "Mom, Dad, don't worry. Those people are not coming back. They're all dead. You're safe now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Richard and Melinda looked at each other in disbelief before their faces broke into expressions of relief and joy. "Marcus, who saved us? You must be grateful to them. Where is our benefactor?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
