  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul stood there dumbfounded, wondering if he was hallucinating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonathan, slightly recovering from the pain, stumbled to his feet and asked, "Mr. Zafer, surely you must be mistaking him for someone else? What makes this nobody worthy of such respect from you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen kicked Jonathan again, snarling, "Listen here, you piece of shit! Even Edgar shows respect to Mr. Fitzgerald. Compared to Mr. Fitzgerald, I'm less than dirt!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'd consider it an honor if Mr. Fitzgerald asked me to be his damn doormat, you got that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood drained from Jonathan's face as he realized he'd crossed someone way out of his league.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Serpent's Coil inside out. After Tory's death, Edgar had basically taken control of the whole organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And here was Edgar's right-hand man, showing such deference to this young man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jonathan broke into a cold sweat, terrified to even imagine what kind of power Marcus must wield.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, he felt nothing but burning hatred for Paul and Louise's family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for them, he would never have crossed paths with someone of Marcus's caliber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Billy, one of Jalen's men, was frozen in terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His whole body trembled uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd been running his mouth off at Marcus earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now he was screwed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was entirely and utterly screwed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus decided to take revenge, it wouldn't just be him! His whole family would pay the price!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought made Billy wish he was already dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me." Marcus turned to Jalen, his voice cutting through the silence. "What's your connection to Jonathan?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen trembled, his face etched with fear as he stammered out his response. "We were friends before. Jonathan would pay me to handle certain... situations. That's how we got close."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I swear I never meant to cross you. Please, just give me one more chance!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's gaze turned cold. "Have you forgotten the rules of the Serpent's Coil? What's the punishment for taking outside contracts behind our backs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Jalen pulled out a knife, his face ashen. In one swift motion, he severed his pinky finger. "According to Serpent's Coil rules, unauthorized contracts are punishable by finger severance. I accept my punishment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of Jalen's bloodied left hand sent shivers through Paul, Billy, and the entire Louise family. They didn't dare breathe a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To see Jalen so pathetically submissive in front of Marcus was chilling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One word from Marcus and Jalen had mutilated himself without question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This display of power was beyond anything they could have imagined, and they feared they might be next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next time, you won't get off so easy with just a pinky finger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's ice-cold voice bore down on Jalen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen nodded frantically, ignoring the searing pain in his hand as he repeatedly thanked Marcus for his mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two were so eager to kill me before." Marcus turned to Jonathan and Paul with a cold smile. "Well, here I am. Take your shot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Neither of them dared to move a muscle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul, especially, was scared shitless. He dropped to his knees in front of everyone, banging his head on the ground. "Mr. Fitzgerald, I was blind and stupid! I've learned my lesson, I swear! Please, for the sake of our family ties, spare my life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus ignored Paul's groveling and turned to Jalen. "Your so-called friend here, deal with him as you see fit. I'm washing my hands of this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen's eyes turned to ice as he barked orders to his men. "Tie some rocks to this piece of garbage and dump him in the river!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men immediately grabbed Jonathan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Real fear finally hit Jonathan as he screamed for mercy. "Mr. Fitzgerald... Mr. Zafer... please don't do this! I've got an elderly mother and a family to support! I don't want to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen didn't give a damn about Jonathan's begging. "Get him out of here and sink him! Now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men dragged Jonathan out like a dead dog.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a river not far from Louise's house. Ironically, the same one Jonathan had been in charge of managing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, that very river would become his watery grave, all because he'd fatally misjudged Marcus's power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd thought his connections and social status would make it easy to take Marcus down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, his plot backfired spectacularly, and it cost him his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus never showed mercy to those who tried to kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Jonathan being dragged to his death, Louise's family was paralyzed with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd been constantly insulting and mocking Marcus - if he decided to hold them accountable, they'd be next!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought hit Louise like a ton of bricks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She collapsed to her knees before Marcus, begging desperately. "Marcus, we were blind fools to offend you. Please don't hold it against us! I'm begging you as your aunt! Please have mercy on us for our family's sake. We'll never dare to cross you again!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
