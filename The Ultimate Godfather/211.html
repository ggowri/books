        <h1>Chapter 210 Changed the Situation</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible? How could you deflect my attack?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man collapsed helplessly to the ground. If it weren't for the protective armor that had absorbed much of the impact, that attack would have obliterated him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, his bones were shattered, and he was completely crippled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to Celestial Reversal, Marcus was completely unharmed, standing as calmly as ever. "You're not qualified to know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm, who was still under Marcus' control, had already been scared out of his wits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew exactly how terrifying the middle-aged man's power was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the presence of someone like him, even the most powerful firearms would be useless. Nothing could harm him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, right now, that same person seemed utterly powerless in front of Marcus, completely shattering everything Malcolm had thought he knew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good! Very good! You've crippled my cultivation, but the Astral Serpent Order will never forgive you for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man screamed in agony, blood trickling from the corners of his mouth as he threatened Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Astral Serpent Order was one of </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> three great Ancient Martial Art Sects, with a deep foundation and extraordinary power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was said that the sect leader had reached Ancient Martial Stage Six, and his single strike could flatten a mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By crippling one of their members, Marcus had surely drawn the wrath of the Astral Serpent Order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus merely sneered and didn't even spare the man another glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before this, he had already killed Brandon of the Golden Group, a man once considered the strongest in Solomia, who was also from the Astral Serpent Order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had already made enemies with the Astral Serpent Order, so he was not afraid of eliminating another one of their members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene left everyone in stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once mysterious and powerful Astral Serpent Order warrior, who everyone had thought invincible, had been reduced to a pitiful state in front of Marcus, unable to even break through his defense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all speculating just how powerful Marcus truly was and what kind of identity he held.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many in the room couldn't help but wonder, and their gazes toward Marcus had completely changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Maxine's heart trembled in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power Marcus displayed was even more terrifying than when he had defeated Gibson in the International Invitational. It was almost beyond human limits, something almost godlike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why haven't you put down your guns yet? Are you waiting for me to kill you all?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' gaze swept over the black-clad men holding firearms, his eyes flashing with an intense and murderous intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men were visibly shaken and instinctively took a step back, fear radiating from their eyes as they stared at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be afraid of him. No matter how strong he is, can he be stronger than a bullet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, one of the black-clad men, eager to prove himself, spoke coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, he moved to pull the trigger, and the two men beside him followed suit, aiming their guns at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before the three of them could fire, three invisible streams of force shot from Marcus' fingertips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the force pierced straight through the center of their foreheads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, loud splashing sounds filled the air as the three men's heads exploded, their blood gushing out in torrents. They fell to the floor, lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this gruesome scene, everyone </span><span>present</span><span> gasped, their faces filled with horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black-clad men holding guns were now completely paralyzed with fear, sweat pouring from their foreheads.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, under intense pressure, one of them couldn't take it anymore and dropped his gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon seeing this, the others followed suit, surrendering their weapons and raising their hands in submission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire ordeal, which could have upended the power of the Burnett family, was resolved in less than three minutes, all by Marcus' actions alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm, Ruth, and Arnold's faces turned a ghastly pale. They never could have imagined that Marcus would be the one to change the course of the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Apologize to Mr. Owen Burnett!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' gaze locked onto Malcolm as he spoke in a voice like thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm, trembling in fear, his knees buckling, immediately collapsed in front of Owen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen glanced at Marcus with gratitude, then looked down at Malcolm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm's face alternated between blue and white, and in such a dire situation, he had no choice but to bow his head to Owen. "Owen, I was wrong. I was blinded by ambition. Please forgive me for this one time. I'll never dare again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen's voice was cold and stern. "Malcolm, you've truly disappointed me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Owen, Malcolm only rebelled because of Shaun's slander. Everything is Shaun's fault. We have nothing to do with this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ruth suddenly dropped to her knees before Owen, shifting the blame entirely onto Shaun.</span></p></div>
