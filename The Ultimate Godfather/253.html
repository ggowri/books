Does it have anything to do with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle asked Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete was her ex-boyfriend, but they had never slept together</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This caused Pete to cheat on other people, and he developed a grudge against Michelle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus boldly admitted, "I did that. Will you blame me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle glared at Marcus and said, "Mr. Fitzgerald, I'm your woman now, and I'll be with you on everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pete deserved to be killed. I certainly don't blame you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle was sincere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since she met Marcus, she had fallen in love with him and was never interested in anyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was satisfied with Michelle's answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They chatted for a while, and then Marcus returned to Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, Jane came to him. After dinner, he began to practice the Shadow Step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the night, Marcus had basically mastered the essentials of the Shadow Step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could even take a few tentative steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was far from the beginner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus wasn't anxious. As long as he had the mantra, it was only a matter of time before he could master it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next morning, with Diana's farewell, Marcus boarded a flight to southwest </span><span>Uswad</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three hours later, the plane landed at Spring City's airport, the largest city in southwest </span><span>Uswad</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spring City was located in a subtropical region and on a plateau.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The climate was like spring all year round, hence the name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Spring City had a large population and thriving businesses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crystal industry was particularly developed there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The eastern part of the city had a large raw stone trading market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This market could cater to any business other than the mining of raw stones in the mountain veins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This market provided a one-stop service of opening stone, processing, sales and auction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were also many gambling stone stalls, which were crowded with a group of people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the raw stone trading market here was mostly aimed at crystal jewelry for ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy crystal that wanted was a special type of stone used by professions such as warrior and Wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These special stones were rare and most of them were traded secretly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus came to the market and spent most of the day wandering around. He secretly asked several shops, but the answers he got were all negative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ordinary shops did not sell energy crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't know what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A typical </span><span>Southvaia</span><span> looking girl walked up to Marcus and asked, "Sir, you've been walking around the market for most of the day, right? Didn't you get anything you wanted? I'm a local and can recommend something to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl's smile was simple and friendly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are a wide variety of goods in this market, but none of them are what I want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir, do you want the energy crystals used by warriors?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl stared into Marcus' eyes and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was low to a whisper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was surprised and asked, "Yes, do you have a way?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl nodded and said, "Yes, but it's not in this market. I can take you there, but you have to pay a certain fee."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked, "How much does it cost?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl said, "Half a million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was a little surprised. He didn't expect that the girl would charge half a million dollars just to show him the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in order to find the source of the energy crystal as quickly as possible, he agreed directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After receiving the money, the girl led Marcus through a series of alleys, and finally came to an old commercial vehicle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The glass of the vehicle was covered with an iron mesh, so it was impossible to see what was inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man wearing a red vest walked down from the driver's seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held a cigarette in his mouth, glanced at Marcus, and asked the girl, "Is this the only one today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl nodded and whispered in the man's ear, "But don't underestimate him. He should be rich!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their voices were quiet. Marcus' distance from them made it impossible for a normal person to hear them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus was at Ancient Martial Stage Four, and his senses were much sharper than those of normal people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He heard their conversation clearly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
