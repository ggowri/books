  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Heath let out a blood-curdling scream, collapsing to the ground and writhing in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The groin, packed with sensitive nerves, was one of the most painful places to be struck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was even more painful than giving birth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The searing pain was so intense that Heath nearly passed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His first thought was that he was finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such a devastating blow meant he would never function as a man again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No more women, no chance of fathering children.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For a man, this was a punishment worse than death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus had said earlier that nobody could leave intact if they dared provoke him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Heath's case, Marcus didn't show any mercy and destroyed his most important part.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gustavo and the remaining bodyguards instinctively clutched their groins, horrified by what they had just witnessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No one expected Marcus to actually kick Heath in such a brutal way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You bastard!" Heath growled through clenched teeth, his voice trembling with pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"How dare you kick me there! I swear, I'll destroy you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus ignored his threats and walked over to Kiera, his tone calm. "Where do you want to go? I'll take you there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera, still reeling from what she had just witnessed, was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She hadn't expected Marcus to strike so ruthlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Most importantly, he had harmed Heath, a member of Kingston's Deleon family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This wasn't just a fight. Marcus had crossed paths with the most powerful family in Uswad, and all because of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If the Deleon family learned about this, they wouldn't let it slip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Why are you standing there? Let's go," Marcus reminded her gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Snapping out of her daze, Kiera quickly followed Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the two walked away, Gustavo finally dared to move, rushing over to help Heath to his feet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Heath had already fainted from the pain, so Gustavo and the surviving bodyguards hurried to get him to the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the Aston Martin, Marcus glanced at Kiera and asked, "You haven't told me where you want to go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Still shaken, Kiera answered quietly, "Home. Take me to Peaceful Apartments."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Living alone due to her job, Kiera rented a modest apartment in an older complex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While not dilapidated, the complex was old and offered cheap rent, just 1.5 thousand dollars a month for a one-bedroom unit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was the affordability that had drawn her there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus adjusted the car's direction and began driving toward Peaceful Apartments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Along the way, the two chatted casually, and Marcus learned about Kiera's relationship with Gustavo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had been childhood friends, growing up together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But while Kiera went to college, Gustavo fell into the life of a petty thug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite this, their shared history had created a bond, and Gustavo's relentless pursuit eventually convinced Kiera to date him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gustavo had promised to turn his life around and find a proper job.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But when Kiera refused to let him cross physical boundaries, his resentment grew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That resentment had led him to offer Kiera to Heath, hoping to curry favor and gain benefits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Had Marcus not intervened, Kiera's fate would have been sealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, thank you so much for what you did today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera's wide eyes sparkled with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus waved it off. "It was nothing. Don't mention it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera's face softened, though a trace of guilt lingered. "Because of me, you've made an enemy of Heath. I'm so sorry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Please, be careful. Heath won't let this go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry," Marcus said with a chuckle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"The Deleon family won't do anything to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His confidence seemed unshakable, but Kiera couldn't help feeling concerned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Deleon family was the most powerful in Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter how formidable Marcus was, the idea of him going against such a force seemed impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their conversation ended as Marcus pulled up to Peaceful Apartments.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He intended to drop Kiera off and leave, but she insisted on cooking him a meal to show her gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Unable to refuse her sincerity, Marcus followed Kiera upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Peaceful Apartments building had been constructed over 20 years ago and showed its age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The facilities were outdated, and Kiera's one-bedroom unit was dimly lit, facing away from the sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite this, the apartment was spotlessly clean, a testament to her care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Marcus entered, his gaze accidentally landed on Kiera's open bedroom door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hanging from a drying rack were several pieces of women's lingerie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera's cheeks turned crimson. She quickly gathered the items, stammering an apology. "I'm sorry, Mr. Fitzgerald. I didn't expect to have a guest, so things are a bit... unprepared."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus chuckled, his tone easygoing. "It's normal, isn't it? Everyone wears these. It just shows you have a life, that's all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, his eyes briefly swept over Kiera.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, he noticed something. Though she was slender, her figure was surprisingly curvaceous.</span></p><div class="pagination">
