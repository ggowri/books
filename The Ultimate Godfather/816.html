        <h1>Chapter 798 Schadenfreude</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was about 26 or 27 years old. He was tall and handsome, with a sharp and well-defined face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was around the same age as Grace. She was elegant and full of youthful energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kenia Aguilar?" Grace asked, a bit uncertain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's me," Kenia replied with a smile. "Grace, it's only been a little over a year since we last saw each other. Did you forget me already?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not really," Grace said. "You just look so beautiful today. I didn't recognize you at first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you also eating at this restaurant?" Kenia asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glanced at Marcus, who was standing next to Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his ordinary clothes, she looked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I've been seeing this place online for a while," Grace explained. "I came to Kingston yesterday and decided to check it out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And who is this?" Kenia asked, looking at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remembered that Grace rarely interacted with men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when Kenia entered the restaurant, she saw Grace and Marcus acting quite close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made her curious about Marcus' identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace hesitated for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lip and said, "This is Marcus, my boyfriend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hoped Marcus wouldn't mind being called her boyfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh?" Kenia was surprised despite her mental preparation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She added, "Grace, I can't believe you're in a relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back in college, you distanced yourself from all boys.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, you had leukemia back then. Are you better now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia was shocked. It wasn't so much that Grace had found a boyfriend, but more that she had found one who seemed so ordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Kenia's memory, Grace had been troubled by leukemia during the second half of her university years and had even taken a leave of absence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never expected that after more than a year without seeing each other, Grace seemed to have recovered her health.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I'm cured," Grace said. "My boyfriend helped me get better."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was grateful to have met Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without him, she might not have survived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia and the tall man next to her were both surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man laughed and said, "Grace, your boyfriend must be a miracle worker. Curing leukemia? There aren't many doctors in the world who can do that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If word gets out, the hospitals all over the world will be eager to recruit him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words sounded like praise, but there was a hint of sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia smiled and said, "I've never heard of anyone curing leukemia before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned back to Grace. "Grace, I know you're trying to make your boyfriend sound impressive, but you don't need to lie about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leukemia is a difficult disease to treat. Maybe a bone marrow transplant could help. You said your boyfriend cured your leukemia. Which hospital does he work at? I have a relative with leukemia. Maybe your boyfriend can treat him too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia thought Grace was lying to make Marcus seem more impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unhappy about their comments, Grace frowned. "Marcus isn't a doctor, but his medical skills are better than any doctor's. He doesn't treat just anyone. He wouldn't agree to treat your relative since he doesn't know them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was not lying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace knew Marcus couldn't help everyone, even with his amazing skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That would tire him out. It was not like he was a savior to the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia and the man laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia said, "I knew he wasn't a doctor. He doesn't have that doctor's vibe. So, you were lying about him curing leukemia, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grace, we were college classmates. We know each other well. You don't need to lie to me for the sake of saving face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And even if your boyfriend is just an ordinary guy, isn't your father the mayor of </span><span>Solomia</span><span>? Mr. Mitchell could easily find him a job. So, I don't understand why you feel the need to exaggerate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia's words grew harsher. Her tone was full of mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she and Grace were classmates in college, they had never gotten along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace was the most beautiful girl in the class and the mayor's daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia's father, on the other hand, was just a bureau chief in a small city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia came up short in any aspect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Kenia jealous of Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Grace took a break from school due to leukemia, Kenia gradually regained her </span><span>confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now they met again. Even though they were no longer in school, Kenia still felt a strong urge to compete with Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to use this chance to humiliate Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Grace could respond, the man beside Kenia spoke, "So, she's Mr. Mitchell's daughter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Nash</span><span>, you know her?" Kenia asked, surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash Holden replied, "I heard that Mr. Mitchell was recently arrested by the OIG for bribery. I didn't expect to meet his daughter today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh?" Kenia was surprised but then smiled knowingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "I see. So that's why you're in Kingston. You came to bail out your father."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nash chimed in, "There's a rumor that the one targeting Benjamin is Pablo Ashford, the son of Commander Ashford. With just your efforts, there's no way you can get him out. Mr. Mitchell is in serious trouble. He might spend the rest of his life in prison."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kenia laughed, "Now I get it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After understanding the situation, Kenia became even more arrogant. She turned to Grace and said, "I used to think your father was still the mayor of </span><span>Solomia</span><span>. But now that he's locked up, </span><span>your boyfriend</span><span> </span><span>can only stay useless. There's no one to help him. How pitiful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words were filled with glee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though they had no real feud, Kenia felt a twisted satisfaction from Grace's misery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The worse off Grace </span><span>seemed,</span><span> the happier Kenia felt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Kenia's gloating expression, Grace felt a chill in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had thought that their relationship as former classmates would matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if they had conflicts during college, those should have faded away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she had been too na&iuml;ve.</span></p></div>
