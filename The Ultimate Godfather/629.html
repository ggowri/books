  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her impression, Albert had a penchant for being in the limelight. However, he didn't strike her as the sort of person who would purchase counterfeit items to deceive people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few years had passed, and it came as a surprise to her that he had changed to this extent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a dark face, Luna hurled the fake Angel's Kiss at Albert and asked angrily, "Albert, you actually lied to me. Do you still have a conscience? I really misjudged you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Born into a prosperous family, she wasn't concerned about the monetary worth of gifts, but he used counterfeit items to fool her, which touched her bottom line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Luna,</span><span> let me</span><span> expla</span><span>in</span><span>. This isn't how it seems!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert grasped Luna's hand and continued, "Luna, I procured the Angel's Kiss from a senior executive in their store. He provided me with a counterfeit item. I was deceived, too. I am also a victim!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Moreover, I suspect that this entire scheme was hatched by this man in collusion with the store employees to set me up. I'm completely innocent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert was brazenly telling lies with such a sincere expression that it was arduous for the average person to discern his deception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna, who was deeply in love with him, was immediately swayed by his account.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She asked, "Albert, is what you said true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert nodded vigorously, then raised his hand and swore, "Luna, everything I said is true. If there is even a single falsehood, I will go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given his harsh oath, Luna was suddenly filled with distress. She stood on her tiptoe and covered his mouth. "Albert, stop talking. I believe you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, she glanced at Marcus and Elena. Her expression turned icy. "Tell me, why did you team up to plot against Albert? How did he offend you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus and Elena looked at each other helplessly, realizing that they were targeted for no reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, "Miss, I don't understand what you mean. Our store is an authorized brand-exclusive outlet. We would never sell such counterfeits. The gentleman's two pieces of jewelry are not from our store."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna was immediately furious. "Shut up. How dare you deny it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she fixed her eyes on Albert and asked, "Albert, the two of them schemed against you. How do you want to deal with them? Tell me boldly, and I will definitely fulfill your wish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since making her appearance here, Luna had remained relatively quiet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as she made a sound, the distinct air of a wealthy woman emanated from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people present felt frightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert said, "Luna, the individual who sold me the counterfeit items was a senior executive of this store. I'll confront him directly and sort things out later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today, you just focus on dealing with this guy. He's the source of the trouble. You must make him pay the price!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert raised his hand and pointed at Marcus, his eyes icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone immediately became nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna's father was the CEO of the McHale Pharmaceuticals Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she really decided to take revenge on Marcus, he would probably be doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he had previously spent 650 million dollars on all the jewelry, such a sum meant little to Luna's father.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade was very worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From her perspective, Marcus' medical expertise was truly remarkable, and even Carter held him in high esteem and addressed him as Master Healer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Marcus was also good at fighting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, these aspects appeared to be inadequate in bolstering his capacity to rival Luna.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jade couldn't help but stress. "Albert, you showed up at my birthday party without an invitation. After that, you continuously launched verbal assaults on my boyfriend and wrongly accused his Tears of the Angel of being counterfeit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your trick backfired, landing you in a pickle. So, in a fit of rage, you slandered that my boyfriend set you up. How shameless you are!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Perez, you absolutely cannot fall for Albert's falsehoods. My boyfriend had no prior acquaintance with him. How on earth could he possibly frame Albert?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as soon as Jade finished her words, Luna scolded, "Stop talking. I believe Albert will not lie to me. Today, anyone who harms him should pay the price!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Luna made a phone call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than a minute, a group of Westoners in suits broke into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all armed with weapons, exuding a terrifying aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people present screamed in terror. They had never expected Luna to attack Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tense atmosphere suggested that she was not joking at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many female students shrieked in fright, rose from their seats, and hid in the corners, fearing that they would be implicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell me, how did you plot against Albert? If you don't speak the truth, I will show no mercy to you!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
