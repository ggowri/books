  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert's face darkened, and his patience wore thin. "Brenden, why would I lie to you? The surgery was a success. If you don't believe me, go in and see for yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin, Maxine, and Brenden froze as if they couldn't believe their ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't believe the surgery really was a success.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hurried into the room and saw Edward lying peacefully in his bed. His limbs were wrapped neatly in bandages, and they had returned to their former straight positions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even without medical knowledge, they could tell that his limbs had been completely repaired!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The surgery was really a success! This is amazing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brenden's face lit up with joy as he rushed out of the room. "Professor Cooper, thank you so much! If it weren't for you, Edward would have spent the rest of his life in a wheelchair, and I would have felt guilty forever!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert waved him off. "What are you thanking me for? If it weren't for Mr. Fitzgerald's guidance, with such severe injuries, not even the best doctors could have done anything. If you're going to thank someone, thank Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those words left Benjamin, Brenden, and Maxine in complete shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't believe that messy diagram really had such a crucial impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, they couldn't believe their ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert looked around anxiously, then asked, "Where is Mr. Fitzgerald? His guidance has been invaluable to me. I need to thank him properly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine spoke up, "Marcus had to leave for something. He's not here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Disappointment immediately spread across Robert's face. "Why didn't you try to keep him here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sighed and continued, "I see. A man like Mr. Fitzgerald surely has a lot to do. I should know he won't wait around for me. I must have overestimated myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He went on, "Charles really found a treasure. He's so lucky to have a family like Mr. Fitzgerald... Oh, my Debra still doesn't have a boyfriend. Before, I didn't see how special he was. What a shame. Oh, if only Debra could be Mr. Fitzgerald's girlfriend..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert's words seemed more like a personal lament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about how he had mocked Marcus at Charles' matchmaking event made him regret it deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's expression darkened, and instinctively, she asked, "Professor Cooper, do you mean Marcus already has a girlfriend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert nodded and briefly recounted the events of that matchmaking banquet to Maxine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Maxine felt a twinge of something sharp in her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't believe there is someone like Mr. Fitzgerald to come from Solomia. What a blessing for Solomia!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin couldn't help but exclaim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maxine, do you have Mr. Fitzgerald's contact information? Please thank him properly for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brenden commanded Maxine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine nodded </span><span>absentmindedly,</span><span> her mind still occupied with Marcus' handsome figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Solomia Hospital, in a high-class ward, Pete had just finished his surgery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the fact that the surgery had been performed by a renowned expert brought by Pete from Eldoria, his arm couldn't be saved because of Marcus' precise cut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at his empty arm, Pete felt a surge of fury. His eyes glinted with cold, murderous intent. "Marcus, I will make you pay for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted, completely losing control of his emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of his subordinates stepped forward to comfort him but was slapped to the ground. "Get lost! All of you get out! If Marcus is still breathing by morning, you don't need to show your face again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man staggered to his feet, his face bruised and swollen, but he didn't dare speak a word, his eyes full of fear. "Don't worry, Mr. Hudson. I've already contacted the Hudson family's top expert in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>. We'll take care of Marcus tonight. No matter how capable he is, he won't see the morning!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Pete finally calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had grown up with everyone spoiling him and had never been humiliated like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, only by tearing Marcus to pieces could he erase the hatred in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't care about any of that. He was already in his Aston Martin, heading back to Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His WhatsApp buzzed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a message from Sweetheart: [Come to my place when you're free. My dad wants to discuss some prescription development with you.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lately, he'd been working closely with Charles on developing more patented medicines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the pharmaceutical company was up and running, they could launch everything together. Only then could they truly open up the market.</span></p><div class="pagination">
