  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen was now in a comprehensive monitoring room, where a large screen was showing the situation in the nightclub where Marcus was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Dave trying to attack Marcus, he wished he could go over and kill Dave right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought, "If I offend Marcus, not only me, but even Edgar will be in trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dave was dumbfounded. He didn't expect that this seemingly inconspicuous young man in front of him would attract so much attention from Jalen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he seemed to have not yet realized the seriousness of the matter and said to Jalen, "Mr. Zafer, this man offended Haley, the heir of TreatMed Pharmaceuticals..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could finish, Jalen roared even more angrily from the other end of the line, "Are you fucking deaf? Listen to me. Whoever offends Mr. Fitzgerald, don't hesitate and just kill him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Dave broke out in a cold sweat because it was the first time he saw Jalen get so angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Dave realize that he had underestimated Marcus' importance in Jalen's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dave, why don't you do anything? Kill that country bumpkin right now." As Dave hung up the phone, Haley's voice sounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Dave said to Haley coldly, "It's you who will be dead. Go ahead and beat him to death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thugs rushed towards Haley, waving iron bars!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haley thought, "What is going on here? Dave only took a phone call, and his attitude towards Marcus changed totally. Could it be that this young man really has some extraordinary identity?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne was also shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had heard of Jalen, but she didn't expect Jalen, who was such a desperate criminal and had killed people without hesitation, to be so respectful to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne thought, "It seems that Marcus' identity is more mysterious than I thought."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haley was immediately frightened and didn't expect things to develop to this point. After a few bars came down, he wailed in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hurriedly asked Leo for help, saying, "Mr. Brown, it's time for you to take action!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo then slowly stood up, his stern face still expressionless. He gently gestured to the two bodyguards behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two pulled out pistols from their waists and pointed at Marcus and Dave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think you can hurt my man?" Leo lit a cigarette and stepped up to Marcus. "I never thought that I would meet someone as arrogant as you when I first came to Solomia. You are good, but unfortunately, you met me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words were full of confidence and arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although most of the nightclub patrons were upper-class people, they rarely came into contact with guns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Leo's bodyguards taking out guns, many people were frightened and turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some female guests even screamed and ran away, fearing that they would be shot for no reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haley laughed wildly, "You country bumpkin, why don't you still be arrogant? In front of Mr. Brown, you are nothing. Tell you the truth, even if you are killed by Mr. Brown today, it will be in vain. No one will stand up for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus being pointed at by a gun, he felt so happy that he wanted to shoot Marcus to death right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne was frightened and felt full of self-blame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "If I hadn't insisted on going into this nightclub, he wouldn't have encountered such bad luck."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It happened because of me. Don't make things difficult for Marcus. Just blame me for everything." Yvonne blocked Marcus behind her, wanting to bear the consequences alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bitch, after this country bumpkin dies, it will be your turn. Don't even think about escaping. I'll fuck you to death tonight," said Haley viciously. He felt relieved at the thought that he could finally press Yvonne on the bed and ravage her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. They can't hurt me." Marcus gave Yvonne another reassuring look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he started counting, saying, "One! Two! Three..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone said, "Isn't this guy scared silly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people were puzzled and looked at Marcus with a hint of sarcasm, wondering what Marcus was going to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, Marcus counted to nine. At that moment, the door to the nightclub was kicked open!</span></p><div class="pagination">
