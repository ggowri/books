  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, looking at the situation, Catherine realized she had been too optimistic&mdash;she had overestimated both the circumstances and people's intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyone applying for regular positions can stay in line. There's only one spot left for the department manager position. Those of you here for that role, please leave," a staff member from Sync Group called out, addressing the candidates in line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the words were spoken, those waiting for the department manager position exchanged disappointed glances, and many turned away, leaving the line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some, however, held onto a glimmer of hope, lingering nearby in case another position opened up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that she was the only one left in line, Catherine let out a breath of relief. Her timing was perfect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, it's my turn," she said, shaking off the tension caused by Gloria's earlier remarks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rummaged through her bag and touched up her makeup, preparing herself to face the interview with full confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could step forward, a middle-aged female interviewer, who had been standing at the front, bypassed Catherine completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gloria, you're here just in time&mdash;come over!" The woman smiled warmly as she waved at Gloria, her expression softening from the stern professionalism she had shown the other candidates to one of genuine friendliness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gloria beamed with satisfaction, swaying her hips as she walked briskly toward the interviewer. "Victoria, you're out here in this heat interviewing all day; you must be exhausted!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victoria smiled back, shaking her head. "It's all for a good cause. Your uncle Leif just became the General Manager of Sync Group's Solomia branch. He needs a team of elite professionals to help get the branch off the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I couldn't leave the interviews to just anyone, so I made sure to be here myself. And, since you're here for your interview, I've been waiting for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Victoria took Gloria's hand, visibly pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Victoria was technically Gloria's aunt, the two had known each other for years, and Gloria had spent much of her childhood at their house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victoria and her husband, childless for many years, had always treated Gloria like their own daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, Victoria," Gloria said sweetly, her smile as radiant as ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fill out this form, quick. Leif specifically told me to reserve a department manager position for you. Work there for a year or so, and then we'll move you up," Victoria said, handing her a form with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rest of the candidates behind them were watching, and whispers started circulating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That girl is the niece of the General Manager of the Solomia branch of Sync Group. No wonder she got to cut the line," one woman murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it's all about who you know. If I had a relative like that, I'd be in charge too. Sigh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a mix of admiration and envy in the crowd as they watched Gloria seamlessly secure the position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no one dared to speak out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's how it worked in this world: it was all about connections and money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without either, you were just a stepping stone for others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, just as Gloria was about to complete the form, Marcus' voice rang out from behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait!" he called, drawing everyone's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Gloria and Victoria turned, surprised. Victoria raised an eyebrow and asked, "Is there something wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stepped forward, addressing the interviewer with a calm but firm voice. "Isn't the order of interviews supposed to follow the line? Even if she jumped ahead, she should still be behind us. Why did you skip over us and directly offer her the position?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words reflected the unspoken thoughts of many in the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had all witnessed Gloria cut the line, and many found it offensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But most people were too intimidated to speak up. Marcus, however, had no qualms about taking a stand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, someone challenging a person with such obvious connections would be risking their career.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, it was well known that Victoria was Leif's wife, and Leif was an influential figure within Sync Group's Solomia branch. The crowd was shocked that Marcus had the guts to speak out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victoria's face tightened, a hint of annoyance flickering across her features. She answered coolly, "I'm the lead interviewer for Sync Group's Solomia branch. All interview decisions are under my authority. I can choose who I want to interview first. And who exactly are you to question the process of Sync Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't back down. "I'm a friend of Ms. Wilson here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you have the right to decide who gets interviewed," he continued, his voice steady, "as the lead interviewer, don't you think you should at least get to know the basics of the candidates&mdash;things like their education, work experience, and age? You should be selecting the best candidates to join the company, not just handing out positions without even asking any questions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was sharp, and his words carried weight. "And yet, you're about to sign a contract with this woman without even knowing anything about her. You're not fit to be the lead interviewer."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected this quiet, unassuming young man to openly challenge the lead interviewer, especially in front of such a prestigious company. It was clear that Marcus was taking a huge risk, and many in the crowd started to wonder if he had just made a monumental mistake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone already knew that Victoria was closely tied to Leif, the General Manager, and that he held a great deal of power within the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one wanted to cross someone like her, especially not someone who seemed so untouchable.</span></p><div class="pagination">
