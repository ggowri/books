        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people were stunned and didn't expect Marcus would appear at this time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, Marcus suddenly disappeared, and most people had forgotten him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people who found it didn't take it seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, in their view, Marcus was a guy who liked to brag and was useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least in military operations, Marcus was a layman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He always said something exaggerated and even doubted Oliver in public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, some people discovered that what Marcus said before actually came true one by one!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Marcus, who disappeared for an hour, reappeared in the sight of people at their most critical moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abel and Josiah were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could naturally feel the invisible strength that Marcus had just released.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was not the power that ordinary people could control at all, because only people who reached Ancient Martial Stage Two could control the energy manifestation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This showed that at present, this young man was at least in Ancient Martial Stage Two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, they didn't care about anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For this action, they made a careful plan but also dispatched the best semi-robots in the organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't take someone who just reached Ancient Martial Stage Two seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You two are finally hooked!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the eyes of all people, Marcus walked to the central position of the data center and looked at Abel and Josiah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly understood that the two of them were so crazy that they even transformed themselves into semi-Roberts to improve their ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was extremely painful to transform ordinary people into semi-robots, and it was necessary to sacrifice much happiness that ordinary people could enjoy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, this required great financial support to do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One could imagine how crazy Abel and Josiah were!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uswadian people, you are the one who took the bait, are you still unaware of it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those people who were killed by you before were all baits that we deliberately arranged to let all of you take the bait. We will keep you here and have a good slaughter!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't expect you to be so stupid that you all took the bait. The so-called God of War in Uswad has nothing special!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abel sneered at Marcus and looked disdainful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you still counting on the support of the elite force in the rear?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked at Abel and suddenly spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Elite force is just our successor. I thought that you attached so much importance to arresting us that your team must be very powerful, so we prepared a large number of elite forces for backup."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now it seems that you are not good at fighting. Even your elite force is useless, and our existing people can easily wipe you out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josiah sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should always be well prepared."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I killed all your elite force. Now, it's your turn!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sneered and walked forward step by step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't go there, you are no match for them!" Oliver spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Marcus wanted to fight Abel and Josiah alone, Oliver looked very anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Oliver couldn't handle them, so he thought Marcus was not a match for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus directly ignored Oliver's words but continued to move forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy is so ignorant, even ignoring the reminder of the Lord of War. I want to see how he died!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene immediately made the rest of the SWAT officers dissatisfied and denounce Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver also looked gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not knowing why, when he first saw Marcus, he felt that Marcus was somewhat mysterious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abel took the lead in the attack and punched Marcus, with a sharp steel thorn on the fist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver completely lost his fighting capacity because of the blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, didn't take Abel's attack seriously but casually reached out and grabbed it, then buckled Abel's wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abel was stunned and wanted to use another hand to attack Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus just broke off casually, and the sound of bone and metal fracture was heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abel's arm was abruptly broken off!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abel screamed, and blood gushed from the broken wound, and more there were more mechanical sparking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this scene, Josiah's arm instantly turned into a Gatling machine gun and fired wildly at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus used Shadow Step and easily dodged the bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, it came to Josiah's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josiah looked terrible, and his mechanical arm slammed into Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' speed was faster than Josiah's, and Marcus punched Josiah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fist fell directly on Josiah's head. And a bang was heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josiah's head exploded immediately!</span></p></div>
