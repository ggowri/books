  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's arrival immediately gave Audrey a new target for her insults. She began shouting and yelling at the crowd, behaving like a complete shrew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald is my client! Don't you dare insult him!" Josie shouted angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had heard of Audrey before. Audrey relied on her husband's influence to run rampant in Kingston, bullying people without fear of consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her daughter was a tyrant at the preschool, and many parents had suffered harassment from Audrey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the preschool staff couldn't do anything to stop her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You tramp! Look at yourself! Don't try to argue with me. Everyone knows you love seducing men!" Audrey jeered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no way you could run such a big company on your own. No one would believe it, no matter how hard you try to explain!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Audrey's words became more outrageous, her behavior fully embodying that of a shrew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie felt humiliated as tears rolled down her elegant face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if some guy helps you, your daughter still needs to kneel and apologize!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's presence didn't deter Audrey at all. She even reached out to grab Leia again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slap!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A crisp slap rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus slapped Audrey across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her sturdy build, she was still a woman. The slap sent her sprawling to the ground, where she let out a wail of pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is this guy? He actually dared to hit Noah's wife?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly! Noah controls multiple large corporations and is also the head representative for Weston preachers in Uswad. His status is highly respected."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This young man is definitely in big trouble for hitting Noah's wife!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd buzzed with chatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While it was satisfying to see Marcus put Audrey in her place, they knew he had brought serious trouble upon himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Noah wasn't a Kingston native and didn't come from a top family, he controlled a vast array of businesses and ranked among the top twenty on Kingston's wealthiest list.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His most significant role, however, was as the head representative for Weston preachers in Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was said that the Weston preachers were under the control of the Godfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, Noah was essentially one of the Godfather's people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just based on this identity alone, even Kingston's elites wouldn't dare provoke Noah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the root of his wife's unchecked arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, when Josie saw Marcus slap Audrey, her expression grew grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Josie knew Marcus had an extraordinary identity and unmatched strength, far beyond that of an ordinary person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, however, Marcus wasn't dealing with someone like Walter Wollaston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to Noah, Walter was utterly insignificant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Marcus had truly kicked the hornet's nest!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie feared that Marcus might get dragged into trouble because of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Audrey got up and furiously shouted at Marcus, "You filthy brute! How dare you hit me? Just you wait! When my husband gets here, neither you nor that tramp will escape!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And that little brat! I'll make sure he can't attend preschool anywhere in Kingston! Every school will blacklist you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's gaze turned icy as he said to Audrey, "Shut your mouth. Say another word, and I'll break your jaw!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Audrey, knowing she couldn't win against Marcus, wisely grabbed her daughter and got into a luxury SUV.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the car slowly drove away, Audrey rolled down the window and said coldly, "Just wait. My husband will make you both pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus ignored her and turned to Josie, saying, "Ms. Shelman, there's no need to get upset over someone like that. Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie nodded softly and prepared to leave with Leia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as they stepped forward, the preschool director, David Bell, appeared with two security guards to block their way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can't leave!" David said firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie frowned and asked, "David, is there something you need from me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>David gave a professional smile and said, "You had a conflict with Mr. Jones's wife. You can't leave just like that, or our preschool won't be able to bear the consequences."</span></p><div class="pagination">
