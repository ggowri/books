  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was helping Melina with something. You don't mind, do you?" Marcus asked honestly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, of course, I don't mind. Actually, I've known about you two for a while now," Natalia replied, biting her lip. Though a tinge of jealousy welled up in her chest, she forced it down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus felt a bead of sweat form on his forehead. He'd been wracking his brain about how to explain his relationship with Melina to Natalia, yet this little firecracker already knew everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't have to explain or feel guilty, Marcus. Melina is my best friend. She's a great girl, and I hope you'll treasure her," Natalia said, and her tone was earnest. "That said, it doesn't change anything between us. I know you have other women besides me and Melina, but I don't blame you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her frankness took Marcus by surprise. He pulled her into his arms, stroking her silky hair gently. "Natalia, you're incredible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shot him a playful glare. "Men are all the same. Sweet-talking women left and right. I bet you've said that exact line to plenty of other girls."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus could only smile wryly, unsure how to respond. Afterward, he took Natalia out for a meal. Initially, Natalia planned to head back to her dorm, but since Marcus was there, she ended up skipping curfew and joining him at a hotel instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it had been too long since they last saw each other. As soon as they got to the room, Natalia kissed Marcus passionately, taking the lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, she was unusually bold and completely in control of the situation. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pushed Marcus onto the bed. Her lips traced his skin, and her breath was hot and teasing. She kissed her way down his body, taking him into her mouth with fervor, nearly making Marcus lose control right then and there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After getting Marcus to the brink, Natalia stripped off her clothes and straddled him. As she slowly lowered herself onto him, Marcus felt her tight warmth envelop him, sending a shiver down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia's movements were unrestrained, her gasps and moans filling the room. It had been a month since they last met, and Marcus couldn't help but notice that her body seemed even more alluring. Her curves were fuller, and her skin was softer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached out to caress her breasts, teasing her sensitive peaks, drawing louder cries from her. Her rhythm quickened, and Marcus could feel her reaching her climax. Natalia's body trembled, tightening around him as she cried out in pleasure. She collapsed onto his chest, and her breath was ragged but her expression was utterly satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus flipped her onto her back, taking charge. His thrusts were deep and powerful, eliciting sharp cries from Natalia. Her entire body was flushed and hot. "Marcus, harder! I've missed you so much," she moaned, and her body arched to meet his movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They explored every angle, every sensation, pushing each other to their limits. Natalia reached her peak five times, and her mind was blank with ecstasy. All the stress and pressure from her studies melted away as she surrendered completely to the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus finally reached his release, Natalia surprised him by sitting up and taking him into her mouth again, swallowing every drop with a satisfied smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, I've swallowed all of your future generations," she teased, and her tone was both playful and sultry. "Now, you're completely mine. No one else can take you away from me." Her seductive gaze, combined with her usual sweetness, tugged at Marcus' heartstrings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled her into his arms, gently stroking her hair. "I've always been yours, Natalia. Always." A radiant smile spread across her face before she drifted off to sleep, exhausted but happy. Marcus looked at her with a doting smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, after Natalia woke up, Marcus checked on her progress with her magic training. She proudly shared that she'd fully mastered the basics of Magic Codex. Pleased, Marcus taught her two advanced spells. They're Lightning and Firebolt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Natalia mastered them, she wouldn't have to worry about anyone harassing her again. After all, Marcus couldn't always be there to protect her. He shuddered to think what might have happened if he hadn't been around when Patrick Isaac targeted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia was studying alone at Kingston University, and Marcus couldn't help but feel concerned for her safety.</span></p><div class="pagination">
