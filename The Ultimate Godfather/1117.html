  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The girls immediately showed expressions of surprise and joy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus destroyed all the cages, and the girls were finally free.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment they walked out of the cave, they burst into tears, overwhelmed with the feeling of surviving such an ordeal.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Thank you, thank you for saving us... You're our savior!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A girl knelt on the ground, and kept thanking Gertie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie quickly stepped forward to help the girl up. "</span><span>Please d</span><span>on't</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>T</span><span>he one who saved you is Marcus. I just came along with him, I didn't really do much."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The girl immediately turned to Marcus with grateful eyes and said, "Thank you, thank you so much. I don't even know how to repay you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as she said this, the other girls also turned grateful eyes toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some girls expressed their willingness to become servants for Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some even said they were willing to repay his kindness with their own bodies.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus waved his hand and said to the girls, "It's nothing, not worth mentioning. You don't need to thank me. I </span><span>just</span><span> hope you can do one thing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The girls immediately nodded in agreement. One girl asked, "Just tell us what you need us to do, and we'll make it happen!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus said, "After being rescued, you will surely become the focus of society, and many media outlets may rush to interview you. I just hope you won't reveal my personal information to anyone."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Remember, anyone, including your parents and close friends."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The girls immediately nodded in agreement and promised not to reveal it to anyone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie </span><span>look at </span><span>Marcu</span><span>s</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If it were someone else, they would surely be eager to receive praise and recognition for </span><span>s</span><span>uch a good deed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus was different from ordinary people.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He actually asked these girls to keep it a secret, not wanting others to know his identity.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This shows how humble Marcus is.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Being capable yet humble is the quality a successful person should have.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This made Gertie admire Marcus even more.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because there were too many girls, Marcus couldn't take them all out of the wilderness at once.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So he contacted Serpent's Coil to send a convoy of dozens of off-road vehicles to the wilderness to pick them up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hundreds of girls were taken away by the convoy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After </span><span>everything was settled</span><span>, Marcus finally felt at ease.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, the sky gradually darkened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Due to her previous injuries, Gertie couldn't help but cough, with a trace of blood seeping from the corner of her mouth.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You</span><span> are not recovered</span><span> yet, let me help you first," Marcus said.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Gertie's face was somewhat pale as she said, "</span><span>We can do that</span><span> later. I'm worried those Ophidians might come for revenge. What we should do now is leave here quickly."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus nodded, </span><span>thinking</span><span> it made sense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't care if the Ophidians came for revenge.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was afraid of being interrupted while healing Gertie.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Judging by Gertie's injuries, the healing process might take some time.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If interrupted at a critical moment, it could affect the healing process and leave Gertie with permanent complications.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking of this, Marcus reluctantly agreed and asked Gertie, "So, where do you think we should go?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie's eyes flickered; she initially wanted to </span><span>say</span><span> hotel but felt it might not be appropriate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Other places seemed unsafe, so she said, "Let's go to my family's training ground. It's empty, and the Rune set up by our ancestors will keep anyone from disturbing us."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus immediately nodded. "Where is your family's training ground?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie said, "Deep in the Kinton Mountains."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"</span><span>Be </span><span>more specific," Marcus continued to ask. His instant teleportation worked like map navigation, requiring an exact spot to arrive instantly.</span></p><div class="pagination">
