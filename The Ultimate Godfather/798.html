        <h1>Chapter 787 Into the Lion's Den-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gunmen fell where they stood, their lives snuffed out in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian, the bodyguard, and the driver exchanged looks of stunned disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't fathom how Marcus had predicted the exact locations of the assassins&mdash;or how he had taken them out so quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His shooting was unmatched, but his ability to anticipate the enemy's every move bordered on the supernatural.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this was only the beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The road ahead stretched for 1.2 miles, dotted with ambush points every couple hundred yards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The assassins had blended into the crowd, using civilians as cover to deceive the security teams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had planned to deliver a single, decisive strike against Julian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But none of them could have predicted the presence of Marcus, the man riding shotgun with skills that defied belief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' spiritual senses spread across the entire street, mapping every movement like a live radar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those criminals didn't have a prayer of slipping through his grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the next three minutes, the Maybach convoy glided smoothly down the street, the pace calm and deliberate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Marcus, this was starting to feel like a high-stakes level in a first-person shooter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each time they passed a hidden ambush, he fired with unerring precision, dismantling </span><span>the threat before it even had a chance to unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gunmen didn't even get to lift their weapons before Marcus took them out, one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian and his bodyguard-driver duo were slack-jawed, their disbelief growing with every flawless shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three minutes later, the convoy cleared the danger zone, unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian sat in stunned silence, struggling to find words for what he had just witnessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, that's that. All the gunmen are down. You just need to ID them," Marcus said casually, slipping his gun back into his Spatial Ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He reached for the door, ready to exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on, kid," Julian called after him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is it, Commander?" Marcus turned back, his tone even.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't intervened for accolades or rewards&mdash;it was simply the right thing to do as a </span><span>Uswadian</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've saved my life today. I don't even know your name. May I ask who you are?" Julian's eyes lingered on Marcus, a glint of genuine admiration in his otherwise weathered gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Saved your life? Nah, let's not make a big deal of it. Name's Marcus Fitzgerald. Take care, Commander," Marcus replied with a half-smile and a quick wave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he stepped out of the car and walked off without looking back, his stride confident and unhurried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julian's gaze followed Marcus as he disappeared into the distance, a rare expression of gratitude softening his normally stoic features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to his bodyguard and said firmly, "Find out everything you can about Marcus Fitzgerald. I want to honor him properly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As one of the nation's top leaders, Julian knew his survival wasn't just a personal matter&mdash;it was a matter of national pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If foreign operatives had succeeded in assassinating him on home soil, it wouldn't just be his name tarnished&mdash;it would've been an embarrassment for the entire country of </span><span>Uswad</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' intervention had spared not only Julian's life but also a potential international humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hero like that deserved recognition. After all, if the nation didn't reward its defenders, who would step forward the next time danger struck?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguard gave a sharp nod, his expression serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time he had seen Julian speak so highly of someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had a feeling Marcus' life was about to take a dramatic turn for the better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, blissfully unaware of Julian's plans, made his way back to Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, every major news outlet exploded with headlines about Julian Ashford's visit to </span><span>Solomia</span><span> and the foreign-backed assassination attempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The stories focused on a mysterious young hero, recounting his incredible sharpshooting skills and his ability to take out ambushers hiding among civilians.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Words like "marksman," "instinctive genius," and "unsung savior" filled the articles, painting the picture of a larger-than-life figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curiously, the reports kept the hero's identity under wraps. No photos, no name&mdash;just vague descriptions of his actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smirked as he read the articles, appreciating the effort to protect his privacy. With a satisfied nod, he closed the news page.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another alert popped up moments later, announcing the formation of a special task force to investigate the assassination attempt on Julian.</span></p></div>
