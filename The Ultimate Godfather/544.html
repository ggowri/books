  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund answered the phone without thinking, his tone sharp. "I told you already. No calls today. I'm organizing an event for Sync Group!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Cross, I'm really sorry, but this is urgent. I have to inform you!" A panicked voice came through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is it? Hurry up, I'm busy!" Edmund's frustration was evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was eager to slap Marcus in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just got the news. The Burnett family has pulled out their investment." The voice on the other end sounded defeated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?!" Edmund's head buzzed, and for a moment, everything seemed to blur. "The Burnett family pulled out? How much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everything. The Burnett family just announced their withdrawal, and our stocks have tanked. They've even hit the limit down!" The voice continued, clearly distressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund felt like the ground had been ripped from under him. His mind spun, and he </span><span>collapsed backward, staring blankly at the ceiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, Tina reacted quickly, catching him before he hit the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Cross, what happened? What's going on?" Tina asked, concerned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Burnett family pulled out... It's over... Everything is over! The company I worked so hard to build, it's done for!" Edmund said, his face blank with despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone fell silent at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Dorian couldn't help but glance at Marcus, his expression unreadable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Marcus had a special status. Even the president treated him with respect and deferred to his judgment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Dorian never imagined Marcus had the power to make the Burnett family pull out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet here they were, just one phone call, and the Burnett family had pulled their investment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dorian considered the possibility of a coincidence, but he knew better. There was no such thing as pure coincidence in this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila also gave Marcus a long, incredulous look, her mind racing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought in disbelief, "Who is this guy? How does he know the Burnett family? This is insane!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila was now even more convinced that Marcus didn't intentionally cause the car accident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her high self-esteem, she wasn't foolish enough to think someone so powerful would take notice of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now do you believe me?" Marcus said with a mocking smile, looking directly at Edmund.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Supported by Tina, Edmund stood up, gritting his teeth. "You've got some guts, but don't think that just because the Burnett family pulled out, my company's finished!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been in the entertainment industry for years, and I still have connections. I can bring in other investors and make a comeback!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina quickly nodded. "Exactly. Mr. Cross' position in the industry is unshakable. Stellar Entertainment will rise again, even without the Burnett family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked at him with thinly veiled derision. "You still think you can control Stellar Entertainment?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stellar Entertainment was founded by me. If I don't control it, who will? You? How laughable!" Edmund said with a sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he finished speaking, his phone rang again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Cross, just now, someone called 'Death' acquired our company for 20 billion. While Stellar Entertainment is no longer under your control, with this new investment, the company not only survived the crisis, but now has enough funds to expand into other ventures!" The voice on the other end was full of excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund's eyes lit up instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the company had been acquired by someone else, he was certain the position of president was still his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That meant he could still exercise full control over Stellar Entertainment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's great! Fantastic! Give me '</span> <span>Death</span><span> </span><span>'s' number. I'll talk to him about the future of </span><span>Stellar Entertainment and maybe pay him a visit!" Edmund regained his confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Stellar Entertainment now under new ownership, if he planned to stay in the game, he'd need to build a solid rapport with the person who took over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few moments later, the person on the other end sent him a text message with a phone number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund looked at Marcus with a smug smile. "See? Even without the Burnett family's investment, we still got a huge investment. Someone just put 20 billion into Stellar Entertainment, four times the amount the Burnett family invested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You didn't expect this, did you? Not only did we survive, but we're on a much better path now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina gave Edmund a </span><span>thumbs</span><span>-up. "Mr. Cross, you're amazing. Way better than some people who think they can control everything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund laughed. "Once that 20 billion comes through, I'll make you the top actress in the country!</span></p><div class="pagination">
