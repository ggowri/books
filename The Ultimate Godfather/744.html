  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada's cheeks flushed slightly at her thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded and said, "No problem."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sweet smile appeared on Ada's delicate face upon hearing Marcus' agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a smile Marcus had rarely seen on her before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ada, I'm very curious. What makes this guy so special that you'd go out of your way to greet him?" Nathan asked coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada had known Nathan for a century.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, he was already the chosen heir of both the Ancient Martial Art family and the Caster family of </span><span>Uswad</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had once participated in a trial together, facing life and death as companions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that trial, they developed a solid friendship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan had secretly harbored feelings for Ada.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had even boldly pursued her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ada only saw him as a friend, nothing more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, in her position, she was forbidden from engaging in romantic relationships.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> she had rejected him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Nathan never forgot about Ada, and even now, a hundred years later, his heart still raced at the sight of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd expected Ada to come straight over and greet him first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, she completely ignored him and walked up to this guy, chatting and laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It crushed Nathan's pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada raised an eyebrow and replied coldly, "He's my friend and saved my life. What's wrong with me greeting him first?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stung by Ada's cold tone, Nathan grew even angrier, his eyes turning to ice as he spoke, "He's just at Ancient Martial Stage Six. I find it hard to believe someone so weak could save your life. Even if you want to talk him up, you don't need to make such ridiculous claims!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many of the onlookers nodded in agreement with Nathan's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Marcus had shown impressive skills earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew there was a massive gap between his power level and Ada's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With such a vast difference in strength, how could he possibly have saved her life? It was utterly absurd!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Nathan wouldn't let it go, Ada's brow furrowed. "You think I need to lie to you? Let me tell you something. Marcus' abilities aren't as simple as they appear on the surface. Him saving my life isn't strange at all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Ada's words, Nathan laughed amusedly. "Ancient Martial Stage Six? How strong could he be? Since you say his power isn't as simple as I imagine, I'd love to test that out myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned his gaze to Marcus, his face full of arrogance. "Kid, I don't know what you did to earn Ada's praise, but since she claims you're so strong, how about we have a match?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words sent a shiver through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was the prodigy of the Caster family really challenging this young man to a duel?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was certainly an interesting turn of events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew Nathan had reached the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Seven, just one step away from breaking through to Ancient Martial Stage Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could someone at Ancient Martial Stage Six compare to such a powerhouse?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this fight were to happen, the outcome would be a foregone conclusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nathan would crush Marcus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow, but before he could speak, Nathan said, "Don't worry, I won't take advantage of my superior strength. I'll only use three moves in this match. If I can't defeat you within three moves, I'll count it as my loss. How's that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These words piqued everyone's interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they all knew Nathan's martial arts far surpassed Marcus'.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three-move limit made it somewhat fair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, most people doubted Marcus could handle even three moves from Nathan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all too aware of Nathan's terrifying power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he first appeared in the martial arts world, he had consistently shown an insane ability to defeat opponents above his level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could fight across at least one major realm boundary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just six months ago, before he had even reached the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Seven, rumors spread that he had defeated an ancient master of the Caster family who </span><span>was at Ancient Martial Stage Eight during a friendly match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It meant fighting across an entire major realm boundary!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the most gifted prodigies could fight across realm boundaries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The advantages of having a higher cultivation level were too great.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite everything, Nathan had defeated that elder figure of the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though hardly anyone witnessed this battle, the Caster family head publicly confirmed its authenticity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone present was too afraid to imagine the terrifying combat prowess of someone who could defeat an opponent far above their level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd stood in silent awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under these circumstances, Marcus would likely struggle to defend himself even with just three moves!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow slightly. He had come here to meet with the warriors of </span><span>Uswad</span><span> to explore the mysteries of the </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall space-time gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Marcus did not desire to waste time atop Divine Mount.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But seeing Nathan's demeanor, Marcus understood that if this nuisance weren't dealt with, it would become a problem sooner or later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> he tentatively asked, "You'll keep your word about only using three moves, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Marcus seemed to take the bait, Nathan nodded eagerly. "Yes, yes, just three moves. I give </span><span>you</span><span> my word. If you can withstand my three moves, I'll count it as your victory and stop interfering with your relationship with Ada!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as Nathan took his stance, he was ready to move against Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada stepped forward, blocking his path, and said, "Nathan, stop this nonsense. As your friend, let me give you some advice! Take back what you said immediately. Don't try to conflict with Marcus, including sparring matches. Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Ada's words, Nathan's frown deepened, and he sneered, "What's this? Have you two already started planning your wedding? Why else would you protect him so much, afraid that I might hurt him? How touching!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did Nathan think this way, but others present also had similar thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, in their minds, Marcus was no match for Nathan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada's rushed intervention was seen as deliberately protecting Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada rolled her eyes and snapped, "Nathan, you've got it all wrong. I'm not protecting Marcus. I'm looking out for you. Forget about giving Marcus three moves. You wouldn't stand a chance against him even in a normal fight. </span><span>So</span><span> I suggest you quit while you're ahead!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
