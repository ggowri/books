        <h1>Chapter 575 Bow to the Underworld King</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abraham stared at his father like he'd just been hit by a truck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man who had coddled him his entire life&mdash;who'd never so much as scolded him&mdash;had slapped him in front of everyone for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, what the hell?!" Abraham shouted, his voice cracking with disbelief. "This guy's just some backwoods nobody! You've </span><span>gotta</span><span> be mistaken!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darren, lurking at the side, looked equally stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborn didn't even blink. Instead, he drove his boot into Abraham's chest, knocking him flat on his back. "Mistaken?" Osborn </span><span>barked,</span><span> his voice sharp enough to cut glass. "Open your damn eyes! That man is Mr. Fitzgerald! Not only does the Axe Gang boss bow to him, but he's the king of Kingston's entire underworld!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you morons had the guts to insult him? You're lucky he hasn't killed you yet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words hit like a bombshell, leaving everyone stunned and slack-jawed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abraham, Lila, Jacqueline, and even Darren looked like they'd just been told the sky was green.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man they'd laughed at and mocked wasn't just some nobody&mdash;he was a king among kings in the city's dark underbelly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbelievable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborn, ignoring their reactions, walked straight over to Marcus. Without hesitation, he dropped to his knees as if bowing before royalty. "Mr. Fitzgerald," Osborn said, his tone filled with humility and reverence, "my son didn't realize who you were. Please, spare his life&mdash;I beg you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He punctuated his plea with deep, deliberate bows, his forehead smacking against the floor with each one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was so quiet you could hear a pin drop as everyone stared at the scene in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abraham's face burned with humiliation, his stomach twisting in knots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching his father grovel before the man he'd just insulted felt like a slap to his very soul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You ungrateful brat!" Osborn suddenly roared, snapping Abraham out of his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you standing there for? Get over here and apologize to Mr. Fitzgerald </span><span>before I throw you out of my house!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abraham flinched like he'd been struck but didn't dare disobey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shuffled over to Marcus with all the enthusiasm of a man walking to the gallows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Say sorry now, or so help me, I'll make you regret it," Osborn growled, grabbing Abraham by the hair and yanking his head down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abraham's forehead smacked the floor with a loud thud, and he winced as blood began to drip down his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't believe his father was going this far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I was wrong!" Abraham stammered, his voice trembling. "I didn't know who you were&mdash;please, forgive me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liz, standing off to the side, was frozen in shock. She couldn't wrap her head around it. The man she'd dismissed as a loser was actually someone who commanded the entire underworld.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization hit her like a freight train&mdash;Lila had told them before that even the Axe Gang boss treated Marcus with respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But back then? They'd laughed it off, brushing her words aside like they were some ridiculous fairy </span><span>tale</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Worse, they'd taken every chance to ridicule both Marcus and Lila, cracking jokes at their expense without a second thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, guilt hit her like a punch to the gut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't you say earlier that your father's arrival would be the end of me?" Marcus said, his tone cool and sharp as a blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abraham broke out in a cold sweat, his words catching in his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could respond, Osborn's hand lashed out again, slapping him hard enough to make his ears ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You idiot!" Osborn bellowed. "You said that to Mr. Fitzgerald? Do you even want to live?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborn's mind was racing. He'd seen Marcus' power firsthand&mdash;the way he'd obliterated the Dragon Tiger Hall general in a single blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now his own son had gone and insulted the one man they couldn't afford to cross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus so much as frowned, it wouldn't just be them two&mdash;it'd be their entire family getting dragged to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fists clenched as fear and fury churned in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abraham, his face bloody and bruised, finally understood the gravity of his mistake. He threw himself to the floor, kowtowing desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One thing was crystal clear&mdash;whatever he'd done, it had to be bad. His father didn't lose his cool like this over small stuff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I'm begging you! Please, just give me one more chance. I swear I'll make it up to you!" Osborn knelt again, his voice shaking as he pleaded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved a hand dismissively, clearly growing tired of the groveling. "Fine, I'll let it go this time&mdash;only because of Liz. But if you ever cross me again, both of you will pay the price."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Osborn and Abraham both sagged with relief, bowing their heads with gratitude until they touched the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't so much as flinch. "Now get out. I don't want to see either of you again."</span></p></div>
