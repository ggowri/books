  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Marcus say so, Maxine suddenly felt a little guilty, regretting talking to Marcus so harshly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't mean it just now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked, "Do you want me to forgive you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus pointed to his lips and said, "Kiss me. It's your only chance to gain my forgiveness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine felt tricked by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won't kiss me? Then I'll go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled and turned to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was kind of a lady-killer now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was easy for him to control a girl who was never in love like Maxine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, Marcus just turned around and then was held by Maxine. She tiptoed and tried to peck him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus wouldn't miss this opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed Maxine's waist and kissed her directly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine instinctively groaned. Her body was experiencing an electric shock, and her mind was blank!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus conveniently pried open her mouth and reached in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling his tongue breaking in, Maxine shivered and wanted to break free, but the sense of limp and numbness from the body left her no strength to get rid of Marcus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus enjoyed Maxine's kiss and started to stroke her ass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he touched her sensitive parts, Maxine woke up from the kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pushed Marcus away, squatting on the ground and panting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You said that I wronged you before, but you are just a pervert!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you just exposed your true colors!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine glared at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't expect him to be so shameless to take the opportunity to kiss her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Except for her grandpa's 80th birthday last time, it was the first time that Maxine had been so intimate with a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Different from last time, Marcus had gone too far this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Maxine felt a mix of wonder and internal resistance as their lips touched and even expected the next kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine cursed herself for being shameless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that feeling just lingered in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there anything wrong with me craving my baby?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled. Seeing Maxine's shyness, he even had an impulse to have sex with her right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maxine, you're such a slut! Fortunately, I didn't propose successfully that day. If I marry a bitch like you, my life will be ruined!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, there was such a mocking sentence in the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine frowned, looking in that direction, saw Shaun appear and met his sarcastic gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A middle-aged man with blond hair followed Shaun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Pete's father, Aiton, the head of the Hudson family in Eldoria!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And behind them, there were eight burly men, who were tall and muscular yet expressionless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They looked just like robots.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus used X-ray vision and instantly realized that these men were cyborgs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And they were more mechanized than any cyborg he had encountered before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It didn't mean that the machinery in their bodies was large, but that they used smaller machinery to integrate more functions and greater forces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mechanical devices of these eight cyborgs were much more advanced than before, and it was not an exaggeration to say that they were epoch-making products!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shaun, why are you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine asked Shaun with cold eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't have any good impression of this man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm here to kill him. But I didn't expect you to be with him. I saw what you just did. If I don't show up, you may probably sleep with him. You bitch!" Shaun said with resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Maxine did not marry him, he felt uncomfortable when seeing her make out with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he wished to chop Marcus into pieces!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shaun, don't cause trouble, or I will call the police to arrest you!" Maxine said, with her teeth gritted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being insulted by Shaun filled her heart with resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now her reputation mattered not, and Maxine just wanted to protect Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening to Maxine's words, Shaun gave a sarcastic laugh. "Do you think the police can control me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even in Kingston, I have never been bound by anyone, let alone in Solomia!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes fell on Marcus, and he said coldly, "Bumpkin, you'll die today!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
