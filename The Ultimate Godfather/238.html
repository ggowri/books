  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The delicate pink petals exuded an irresistible allure, as if beckoning Marcus into their embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't stop, Mr. Fitzgerald. Take me now&mdash;I can't wait any longer," Melina gasped, her voice thick with desire as she arched her body toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cramped space inside the car left little room to maneuver; this was the only position that allowed him to fully take her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't hold back any longer. He quickly stripped off his clothes and moved into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he pushed forward, a brief resistance stopped him&mdash;a delicate barrier that made him freeze for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected this. Melina was a virgin?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given her bold personality, it didn't seem possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus entered her, Melina let out a cry of pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intense, unfamiliar sensation of being stretched to her limit was overwhelming, nearly causing her to lose consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Melina gradually adjusted, Marcus began to move with careful, measured motions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The initial pain faded, replaced by a growing wave of euphoria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With each deep thrust, it felt as if Marcus was lifting her to new heights, sending her senses spiraling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mm... ah... oh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being her first time, Melina was too shy to utter the kind of bold words she'd heard from others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, she covered her mouth with trembling hands, trying to stifle her sounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as Marcus' movements grew more intense, her attempts at restraint crumbled. The overwhelming sensations crashed over her like a tidal wave, leaving her mind blank as she surrendered completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before this, Melina had often heard that the connection between a man and a woman was the greatest pleasure in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the time, she hadn't believed it, but now, experiencing it herself, she understood the truth of those words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus' movements intensified, Melina quickly reached her second peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, it was more than just a moment of bliss&mdash;it was a powerful, all-consuming climax that left her breathless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming sensation almost made her lose </span><span>consciousness,</span><span> her entire body enveloped in the surge of pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey... I feel so good..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At last, without even realizing it, Melina voiced her true feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' strength caught her completely off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ferrari rocked relentlessly, the sound of love filling the air, and the atmosphere </span><span>was thick with raw desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The passion raged on for an hour before finally winding down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a final surge, Marcus led them both to the peak of ecstasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was her Innate Enchanting Physique, but Marcus couldn't hold back. He lost control and poured everything into her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina's body trembled </span><span>uncontrollably,</span><span> her face alight with pure happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took a while before she regained her senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald... did you... inside me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her first instinct was to ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a woman, she knew how to protect herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry... I couldn't stop myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus offered a sheepish smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know you didn't mean to, Mr. Fitzgerald, but... if I were to have your child, maybe that wouldn't be such a bad thing after all," Melina murmured, her voice soft, lost in a daydream of romance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus never expected this&mdash;this elegant, top-model figure, someone with the world's most stunning body, was actually a hopeless romantic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well... if you do end up pregnant... let me know. I'll take responsibility as a father," Marcus said seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though there were many women around him, he was always a man of his word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If a girl got pregnant by mistake, especially the first time, he wouldn't turn his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're sure about this? I'll hold you to it," Melina teased, her small fist waving playfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face, flushed with a deeper red, radiated an unexpected charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, don't call me Mr. Fitzgerald anymore. Call me Marcus. It's too formal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gently reminded her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it, Marcus," Melina replied sweetly, her head nodding in understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but replay the passionate moments she had shared with him in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh no... why can't I stop thinking about those embarrassing things? Am I... am I a slut?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina wondered inwardly, her face turning even redder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief moment, they tidied up, and Marcus drove her Ferrari, taking her back to school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before leaving, Marcus told Melina he'd be heading back to Solomia and wouldn't be back in Kingston for about a month, asking her not to worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina nodded obediently, grateful for how smoothly everything had gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was more than content to be with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After parting ways with Melina, Marcus returned to Sunshine Estates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie had personally prepared a lavish meal for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Marcus was leaving for Solomia the next day, this dinner served as a farewell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the graceful and attentive woman before him, Marcus felt a rare warmth that reminded him of home.</span></p><div class="pagination">
