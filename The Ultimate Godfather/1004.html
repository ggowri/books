        <h1>Chapter 924 You Bitch!-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gertie, tell me, are you lying to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser's voice was hysterical, almost frantic. He gripped Gertie's shoulders tightly, shaking her violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie's delicate frame trembled under the force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yasser, I'm not lying. It's true. That's why I can't marry you. It's not that I don't love you, but I'm no longer pure..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie finally revealed the truth she had buried deep in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Gertie felt as though a heavy weight had been lifted from her chest, and her body relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the seriousness in Gertie's expression, Yasser's eyes gradually filled with despair, mixed with deep disappointment. "Tell me, who was it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Yasser exuded a fierce killing intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere around them grew heavy and oppressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can I not say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie spoke softly, not wanting to revisit the painful past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, tell me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser gritted his teeth, his voice filled with hysteria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always loved Gertie deeply, and now, knowing she had been taken by another man, his heart bled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt as though he had lost the most precious thing in his life, and he needed to know who had taken it from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was Marcus, the man you met before," Gertie said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew some things couldn't be hidden forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if she didn't say it, Yasser's resources would eventually uncover the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Gertie finished speaking, Yasser slapped her hard across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood seeped from the corner of Gertie's mouth, and half of her face swelled up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bitch! You're so vile! And to think I held you in such high regard!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm your fianc&eacute;! Half a month ago, I wanted to be intimate with you, but you refused and even fought with me, then ran away from home!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never thought you'd go meet your lover! You're such a slut! How did I not see how low you were before?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been chasing after you for decades, only for you to end up in someone else's bed so easily. I'm such a fool!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser's expression completely crumbled as he roared in fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His rage was so intense that the air around them felt stifling, making it hard for Gertie to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yasser, I know this is all my fault. I've wronged you, and that's why I chose not to marry you. You should find someone better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I want you to know that I didn't willingly lose my purity to Marcus. He forced himself on me. I'm a victim too...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I'm not telling you this to gain your sympathy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I often feel guilty toward you. I'm telling you this because you're the only man I've ever loved. Since I've lost my purity, I've chosen to leave you on my own. But please, give me some respect. I'm not a slut. I'm a victim too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie said, holding her swollen cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before saying this, Gertie had expected Yasser to break down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But unlike what she had imagined, Yasser blamed her entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calling her a slut completely shattered Gertie's defenses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, after saying this, Gertie broke down in tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't ask for Yasser's forgiveness, nor did she expect to marry into the Tucker family. She only wanted his understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because, in Gertie's eyes, she was also a victim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wished she could tear Marcus apart, grind his bones to dust, but she lacked the strength to do so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You vile thing, still arguing with me, huh? I bet you seduced him. You even set up an illusion rune to cover up your filthy affair. And here I thought that man was teaching you some secret technique!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you let another man have you right under my nose. You're such a fucking slut! If I had known this 15 days ago, I should've just taken you myself!"</span></p></div>
