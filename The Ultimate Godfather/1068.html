  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe opened her mouth to respond, but before she could&mdash;Thorne's phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His smirk faltered. His gaze dropped to the screen. The caller ID made his stomach lurch. It was the head of SiliconWave Technologies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a split second, his pulse kicked up. A tiny sliver of doubt crept in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he forced a laugh and shook it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">No. No way. Just a coincidence. That's all. That guy? Some nobody from the entertainment industry? There's no way in hell he has that kind of pull. This is just a fluke. Has to be.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thorne snatched up his phone, his tone shifting to something </span><span>respectful in an instant</span><span>. "Sir, I'm on a business trip in Solomia. Everything's been handled on my end. If you need anything, my assistant can take care of it for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't call to discuss business. I'm calling to let you know&mdash;you're fired."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thorne's polite smile froze. He'd expected a routine check-in, maybe a new directive. Instead, the words hit like a gut punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He let out a short, nervous laugh. "Sir, I think I misheard you. Could you say that again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said&mdash;you're fired. That clear enough for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The CEO's voice was flat, edged with impatience. He even started doubting Thorne's hearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thorne's mind reeled at the words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His whole body tensed, like someone had yanked the ground out from under him. The CEO had actually called just to fire him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This&mdash;this has to be a mistake. Sir, I've been with SiliconWave Technologies for over ten years. I've built this department from the ground up! You can't just fire me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice pitched higher, disbelief thick in his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes snapped to Marcus, and for the first time, real fear crept in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">This isn't a coincidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But if it wasn't... Then who the hell is this guy standing in front of me?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not a mistake," the CEO said, his tone matter-of-fact. "And for the record, this wasn't my call. It came from the top. The real top. My hands are tied. Sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thorne felt his knees threaten to buckle. The room seemed to tilt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One phone call. That was all it took. And just like that&mdash;he was out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His throat tightened. The CEO's words echoed in his skull. The decision came from the top.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Did that mean... this guy is the one pulling the strings?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No. Impossible.</span><br><span>He refused to believe it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fingers clenched around the phone. His voice wavered. "Sir, at least tell me who made this decision. I'm in Solomia&mdash;I haven't done anything to piss off the higher-ups! This is insane!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The CEO let out a slow exhale. "The person who made the </span><span>decision</span><span>? He's standing right in front of you. You were </span><span>fail to recognize him</span><span>, and now, well... this </span><span>serves you right</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honestly? You being gone is for the best. Someone as clueless as you was bound to screw things up sooner or later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thorne's breath hitched. His fingers went numb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It hit him then, like ice-cold water down his spine. </span><span>It was highly likely that t</span><span>he higher-up was Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The call ended with a dull beep. The phone slipped from his grip and clattered onto the floor. He didn't even try to catch it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thorne? What's going on? You look like you've seen a ghost."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isolde stepped closer, brows pinched in concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lips parted, but the words felt foreign in his own mouth. "I-I've been fired. The company's top executive fired me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sounded hollow. Like the fight had drained out of him entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isolde went rigid. Her brain struggled to process the words. A chill ran through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eulalia just gawked at Marcus, her usual smug expression wiped clean. It was like she was seeing him for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe didn't look much better. Her fingers curled at her sides. It took a moment for her to find her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One phone call," she murmured, "and he's gone." The realization sent a shiver down her spine.</span></p><div class="pagination">
