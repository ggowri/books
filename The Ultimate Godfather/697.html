        <h1>Chapter 696 Persuade</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man was the heir of the Royal Entertainment and the Walsh family in the Greater Bay Area, Ross!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ross was the one who could truly decide the future development path of every star!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone took him seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some popular female celebrities tried every possible way to get close to Ross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ross was imposing and dignified and had the unique aura of a young man from a wealthy family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was rumored that he was a womanizing man and had affairs with many popular female stars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was normal for </span><span>such </span><span>people of high status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And no one cared about this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strong ones always had more mating rights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was true for both humans and animals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as a person's strength was strong, many of the opposite sex would take the initiative to approach him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Ross expressed his desire to sleep with a female star, the female star would not only refuse, but also wait for him with high expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was how powerful the Walsh family was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Ross was surrounded by many popular actresses, including Chloe and Lucy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each of them was a stunning beauty. They were all trying to curry favor with Ross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ross had a cold look. The beautiful women did not arouse much interest in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after that, it was time for the photo session that Chloe had mentioned before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ross took photos with many stars and the new popular young actresses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila was one of the young actresses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under normal circumstances, Lila would not refuse to take photos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ross asked all the young actresses to stick their bodies to him in various poses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some were held in his arms, some lay behind him, and some hugged his legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The postures were quite ambiguous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A professional photographer posed for the young actresses according to Ross' request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of refusing, the actresses were excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought it was an honor to get a photo with Ross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And no one dared to refuse Ross' request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ross was powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If anyone made Ross unhappy, he would be out of the entertainment business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Learned </span><span>of </span><span>Ross' request, Lila decisively chose not to participate in the group photo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It should be twelve actresses. Who is missing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The photographer suddenly noticed that one person was missing, so he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was Ross' staff photographer, trying to save Ross time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Ross got angry, the photographer might get punished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lila's not here," Chloe said nervously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe didn't expect that Lila wouldn't even refuse to take a group photo with Ross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila embarrassed Ross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong with Lila? Mr. Walsh wants to take a photo with her. Who knows her well? Go get her right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The photographer frowned and commanded the eleven young actresses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe volunteered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, she had the best relationship with Lila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she noticed that Ross was a little unhappy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe quickly went to Lila and Marcus and urged Lila anxiously, "Lila, why don't you take the photo with Mr. Walsh? You embarrass Mr. Walsh. He told you to go back. Come with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila shook her head and refused, "Chloe, I can't cooperate with the pose that Mr. Walsh asked me to take for the photo. I'm not taking pictures with him. Just go back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe said unhappily, "Lila, you may offend Mr. Walsh. If he gets angry, he'll throw you out of the entertainment industry. We all agree to take the photo, but you don't. He'll hate you for doing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm your best friend, so I came here to advise you. It's up to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe felt helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't understand what was wrong with Lila. Lila's repeated rejection of Ross for a security guard is only ruining her career.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila refused again, "I said I'm not going back. Leave me alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe said angrily, "Okay. You can expect Mr. Walsh to be angry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Chloe returned to the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The photographer asked Chloe, "Where's Lila? Mr. Walsh has been waiting for her for a long time!"</span></p></div>
