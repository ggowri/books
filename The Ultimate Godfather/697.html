They were all trying to curry favor with Ross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ross had a cold look. The beautiful women did not arouse much interest in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon after that, it was time for the photo session that Chloe had mentioned before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ross took photos with many stars and the new popular young actresses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila was one of the young actresses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under normal circumstances, Lila would not refuse to take photos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Ross asked all the young actresses to stick their bodies to him in various poses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some were held in his arms, some lay behind him, and some hugged his legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The postures were quite ambiguous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A professional photographer posed for the young actresses according to Ross' request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of refusing, the actresses were excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought it was an honor to get a photo with Ross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And no one dared to refuse Ross' request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ross was powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If anyone made Ross unhappy, he would be out of the entertainment business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Learned </span><span>of </span><span>Ross' request, Lila decisively chose not to participate in the group photo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It should be twelve actresses. Who is missing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The photographer suddenly noticed that one person was missing, so he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was Ross' staff photographer, trying to save Ross time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Ross got angry, the photographer might get punished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lila's not here," Chloe said nervously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe didn't expect that Lila wouldn't even refuse to take a group photo with Ross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila embarrassed Ross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong with Lila? Mr. Walsh wants to take a photo with her. Who knows her well? Go get her right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The photographer frowned and commanded the eleven young actresses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe volunteered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, she had the best relationship with Lila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she noticed that Ross was a little unhappy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe quickly went to Lila and Marcus and urged Lila anxiously, "Lila, why don't you take the photo with Mr. Walsh? You embarrass Mr. Walsh. He told you to go back. Come with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila shook her head and refused, "Chloe, I can't cooperate with the pose that Mr. Walsh asked me to take for the photo. I'm not taking pictures with him. Just go back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe said unhappily, "Lila, you may offend Mr. Walsh. If he gets angry, he'll throw you out of the entertainment industry. We all agree to take the photo, but you don't. He'll hate you for doing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm your best friend, so I came here to advise you. It's up to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe felt helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't understand what was wrong with Lila. Lila's repeated rejection of Ross for a security guard is only ruining her career.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila refused again, "I said I'm not going back. Leave me alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe said angrily, "Okay. You can expect Mr. Walsh to be angry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Chloe returned to the hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The photographer asked Chloe, "Where's Lila? Mr. Walsh has been waiting for her for a long time!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
