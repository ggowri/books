        <h1>Chapter 885 Dual Cultivation-1</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison's skin was slick with a fragrant sheen of sweat as if she had slipped into a faint trance in moments.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus rolled off her, gasping for breath in deep, exhausted inhales.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison was a Level Seven Demon Fighter&mdash;and a virgin, no less.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their Dual Cultivation had been an intense drain on their energy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As a result, Marcus was feeling worn out, too.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He focused inward, using a technique to check his internal progress. What he saw stunned him: their Dual Cultivation had boosted his cultivation to Stage Four of the Acquired Return Essence Realm!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His strength had reached a whole new level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Based on his earlier expectations, he realized that, after reaching Stage Four of the Acquired Return Essence Realm, he could now rival an expert at Stage Nine of the Acquired Return Essence Realm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was the true benefit of mastering the Hidden State in his training.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>On top of that, the cultivation manuals Marcus used were incredibly intricate and far beyond ordinary ones. Compared to the standard cultivation manuals others followed, the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire carried an inherent advantage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only did it speed up his training it also granted him the rare ability to challenge opponents beyond his level with astonishing power.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This breakthrough wasn't just about increasing his combat strength&mdash;it was a transformation in every aspect.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Marcus' spiritual powers had more than doubled in strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With just a thought, he could release his spiritual senses, extending them over a radius of hundreds of miles.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only did the range grow vastly wider, but he could also perceive far more intricate details within that vast expanse.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In short, this cultivation breakthrough was a total metamorphosis for Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was as if he had been reborn.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And this was one of the defining features of a warrior advancing into the Return Essence stage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once Marcus entered the Return Essence stage, the speed of his cultivation progress slowed significantly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, every breakthrough in this stage brought far more powerful benefits than those in the Foundation Establishment Stage.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What made Marcus truly extraordinary, though, was that not only did he enjoy the </span><span>immense advantages of advancing through the Return Essence stage, but through various methods, he had managed to maintain an astonishingly fast breakthrough rate with no slowdown whatsoever.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since reaching the Return Essence stage less than a month ago, he has achieved Stage Four of the Acquired Return Essence Realm!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To put that into perspective, reaching such a state in just one month was practically unheard of for anyone else in the Return Essence stage&mdash;it was a feat that could only be described as borderline monstrous.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A moment later, Alison stirred from overwhelming desire, slowly returning to herself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her first instinct was to cover her body with her clothes, shielding her alluring figure from view.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her gaze shifted to Marcus, now filled with wariness.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You think covering yourself now matters?" Marcus teased with a grin. "I've seen everything worth seeing."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Scoundrel!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison shot him a glare, her eyes cold fury.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Quickly, she pulled a fresh set of clothes from her Spatial Ring and changed, reapplying her makeup as she did.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, she seemed to regain her usual aloof demeanor, the ice-cold exterior she was known for.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If she didn't speak, no one would have known what she had just gone through.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I swear, I'm going to kill you one day!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Alison muttered through gritted teeth, her hatred for Marcus so intense she could almost picture ripping his soul apart right then and there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But as she spoke, her mind couldn't help but wander back to the vivid images of their passionate encounter, the unforgettable sensations from the peak of their intimacy still fresh in her thoughts.</span></p></div>
