  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being the heir to Royal Entertainment had definitely made Ross into quite the hothead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, seeing Victor's attitude toward him, his privileged rich-kid temper finally exploded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just a worthless piece of junk," Ross sneered. But before he could even finish his sentence, Victor's face transformed with pure fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand whipped across Ross' face with devastating force&mdash;he wasn't holding anything back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The impact sent Ross flying, crashing into a nearby table loaded with food. The table collapsed under him, drenching him in drinks and food. He lay there in a mess, his face already swelling up with an ugly purple bruise where Victor had struck him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ross howled in pain, blood trickling from his mouth. The hit had knocked several of his back teeth clean out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the Supreme Token of the Bloodthirsty Cult." Victor's voice shook with rage. "This token represents the Cult Leader himself. How dare you disrespect the Supreme Token?" His eyes blazed with murderous intent. "I could kill you for this, you know that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor's hands shook with rage as he snatched up the Supreme Token from the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't even care about the dirt. He just frantically wiped it clean with his sleeve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he lifted the token high above his head and dropped to his knees. Strange words spilled from his lips in what sounded like an ancient language, his face a mask of pure devotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one understood what Victor was saying, but they got the gist. He was probably performing some kind of ritual apology for Ross' disrespect toward the Supreme Token.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd stood there in stunned silence. Nobody had seen this coming&mdash;Victor had actually decked Ross in front of everyone, and he hadn't held back. And all of this over a token that apparently came from Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was wild enough that Victor had hit Ross, but even crazier was how he'd been treating Marcus with that insane level of respect. Victor's words kept echoing in their heads. "This token represents the Cult Leader himself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That statement alone told them just how big a deal this Supreme Token really was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's minds were racing with the same questions&mdash;how did Marcus get his hands on something this important? Was he connected to the head of the Bloodthirsty Cult somehow? Why else would he have such a token?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's minds raced with questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their looks toward Marcus had completely changed. Gone were the sneers and mockery, replaced by pure shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ross struggled to his feet, still clutching his stinging cheek. "Mr. </span><span>Drakov</span><span>," he demanded of Victor, his voice shaking, "is this token really as precious as you say? You struck me in front of everyone over a piece of metal. I just don't get it. Why would you do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victor's patience snapped at Ross' continued stubbornness. "Listen," he growled through clenched teeth, "I've told you. This token represents the leader of the cult. When you disrespect the token, you disrespect the entire Bloodthirsty Cult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, you're the heir to Royal Entertainment with trillions of dollars to your name. But if you cross the Bloodthirsty Cult, we can make your entire family vanish from the face of the earth in a heartbeat."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A collective gasp rippled through the crowd. Everyone had heard whispers about the Bloodthirsty Cult&mdash;a shadowy organization known for their mastery of </span><span>Southvaia</span><span> curse magic, filled with people who wielded impossible powers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If anyone else had made such a threat against Ross, no one would have believed it. His status was just too high. But coming from Victor, that was different. No one doubted his words for a second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ross got the message loud and clear. His whole body trembled as the truth sank in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ross might be Royal Entertainment's heir, but he knew better than to mess with the Bloodthirsty Cult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His grandfather had drilled it into his head when he first asked Victor to be his teacher&mdash;he should never, ever piss anyone from the Bloodthirsty Cult off. Their family couldn't afford that kind of heat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, looking at the mess his temper had gotten him into, Ross felt real fear creeping in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get on your knees and apologize to this gentleman right now." Victor's voice cracked like thunder through the room. "Even I won't be able to protect you if you don't."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ross' body shook, but his face twisted with stubborn pride. "Mr. </span><span>Drakov</span><span>, I know I disrespected the Supreme Token. I'll apologize to the Bloodthirsty Cult&mdash;hell, I'll even apologize to the token itself. But why are you making me kneel to this guy? What's he got to do with the Bloodthirsty Cult?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could say another word, Victor stepped forward and shoved Ross' head down, forcing him to the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen up," Victor growled. "The Supreme Token is sacred, sure. But this man is the one who has the power to grant Supreme Token. Disrespecting him is the same as disrespecting the entire Bloodthirsty Cult. </span><span>Got</span><span> </span><span>it now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the room went dead silent, their faces frozen in shock. The implications of Victor's words hit them like a truck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their eyes, Marcus had transformed from a mere bodyguard to the owner of Stellar Entertainment, and now he was revealed as someone with the authority to grant Bloodthirsty Cult Supreme Token. This revelation completely shattered everyone's understanding of who he really was.</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
