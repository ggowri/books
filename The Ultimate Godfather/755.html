  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of Timeless Numinous Energy coalesced in Marcus' palm. Gently, he placed his hand on Nadia's lower abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Timeless Numinous Energy seeped into Nadia's body gradually through his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He touched Princess Nadia's body. What audacity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lionel immediately bellowed at Marcus, seemingly eager to seize this opportunity to showcase himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sneered and turned to face Lionel, stating, "If I don't touch her body, how on earth can I treat her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lionel's face flushed in an instant, and he was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus briefly retracted his arm and addressed Raphael, "I don't want to be interrupted. Please leave the room for the time being. Her condition is grave, and the treatment process will likely take around an hour."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He can't be alone with Princess Nadia. Mr. Stewart, don't listen to him. I suspect he harbors malicious intentions towards Princess Nadia!" Lionel immediately protested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other members of the Nuer Tribe voiced their support for this assertion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raphael gave Marcus a penetrating look, then waved his hand at everyone and said, "Do as he says. Everyone, leave here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lionel's face darkened. He hadn't anticipated that Raphael would trust Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to speak, Ashton stopped him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ashton said, "Since Mr. Stewart is willing to place his trust in a human, let's refrain </span><span>from getting involved in this matter. We'll mete out punishment to him after he fails!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Lionel reluctantly nodded and followed the others out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan said to Marcus, "Marcus, I'm going out as well. I wish you good luck."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded in response to Susan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shortly after, the door closed, leaving only him and Nadia in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Free from the disturbance of others, Marcus could fully immerse himself in treating Nadia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He activated the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Timeless Numinous Energy swirled around his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, with great care, he lifted the thin gauze covering Nadia and placed his hand on her lower abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without the obstruction of clothing, the Timeless Numinous Energy could be transmitted more effectively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Timeless Numinous Energy flowed from Marcus' palm into Nadia's body, causing Nadia, who was in a coma, to emit a soft groan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus knew that this was a normal reaction as the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire penetrated her body, indicating that Nadia hadn't reached a truly life-threatening state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus first infused a stream of Timeless Numinous Energy into Nadia's body to stabilize her condition, and then retrieved a pill from the Spatial Ring and assisted Nadia in taking it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This pill could help restore her immune capabilities and fend off the encroachment of the Cursed Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simultaneously, Marcus adjusted the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire to a different level of intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Timeless Numinous Energy became even more refined and concentrated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Timeless Numinous Energy coursed from Nadia's lower abdomen into her body, traveling, circulating, and eventually converging within her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the medicinal power of the pill came into effect, combining with the Timeless Numinous Energy to rapidly repair the damaged tissues in Nadia's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia's face promptly regained its vitality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps spurred by the Timeless Numinous Energy, Nadia, who had just regained some energy, let out soft gasps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her restored vitality, she appeared even more alluring and charming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia's charm was distinct from that of the women in Oriana Land, exuding an exotic allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus exerted every effort to keep his mind composed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Nadia's internal energy had recovered to a level sufficient to sustain her life, he commenced the process of removing the Cursed Power from her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The healing efficacy of the Timeless Numinous Energy was even more potent than Marcus had envisioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even for the Cursed Power embedded within the genes of the Nuer Tribe, the Timeless Numinous Energy retained a formidable ability to expunge it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After merely about half an hour, the Cursed Power in Nadia's body was nearly entirely </span><span>eradicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following the removal of the Cursed Power from her body, Nadia's complexion grew even more rosy, and her breathing became steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Nadia's eyelashes fluttered, and she opened her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she beheld a strange man seated by her bed, she couldn't help but let out a startled cry, her face registering fear. She attempted to rise quickly to put some distance between herself and Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't move. I'm treating you. Hold on," Marcus said to Nadia in a rush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a critical juncture in the treatment. If the treatment were to be interrupted, all the previous efforts might well be in vain, affecting the treatment outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia nodded gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, while in a coma, she had a long-drawn-out dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the dream, she fell in love with a handsome man bearing an Oriana Land countenance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man treated her with meticulous care and attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They quickly fell in love. Overcome by passion, Nadia engaged in an intimate encounter with the man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That sexual experience granted Nadia an unprecedented sense of pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Prior to this, as a young and innocent girl, she had yearned for such pleasure many times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the dream, Nadia was completely ensnared by this pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was on the verge of reaching orgasm, she woke up and saw Marcus treating her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia felt a pang of disappointment, still yearning for more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when she discerned Marcus' features, she was astounded to discover that Marcus was the very man she had fallen in love with in her dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At present, Marcus' hand was touching her lower abdomen. That tangible sensation of touch made Nadia blush with shyness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How are you feeling now? Do you feel any discomfort?" Just as Nadia was reminiscing about the pleasure in the dream, she heard Marcus inquire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She blinked and promptly replied, "No, I don't feel any discomfort..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very well. The subsequent part of the treatment might be a bit difficult to endure. Try to hold on..." Marcus cautioned Nadia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, he intended to utilize the Timeless Numinous Energy to completely eliminate the remaining Cursed Power in Nadia's body and restore her tissue cells damaged by the curse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This treatment process had the potential to stimulate the sensitive nerves within Nadia's body, much like when Marcus treated other women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus hadn't anticipated that Nadia would awaken prematurely. Had she not awakened, she wouldn't have experienced that intolerable sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the situation had become somewhat precarious...</span></p><div class="pagination">
