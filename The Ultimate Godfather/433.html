  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, how did you manage to do that?" Diana asked Marcus, her bright blue eyes wide with wonder and her cheeks flushed with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's the power of Dual Cultivation. It benefits not just you but me as well," Marcus replied with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana gazed intently at the strikingly handsome young man before her, utterly amazed. When the Godfather had first assigned her to work with Marcus, she hadn't thought much of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had even prepared herself for potential elimination by the Godfather's other two sons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But as time went on, Marcus continued to surprise her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now, his power had reached a level that even Diana couldn't fathom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Plus, his mastery of Dual Cultivation was nothing short of miraculous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Diana's experience, Dual Cultivation typically involved drawing feminine energy to supplement masculine energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When men led the Dual Cultivation process, they would enhance their own power by absorbing women's feminine energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For the women involved in Dual Cultivation, the consequences ranged from severe energy depletion to, in worst cases, being reduced to a corpse on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The remarkable aspect of Marcus' dual cultivation technique was how it benefited both parties equally through energy exchange and mutual growth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana had never seen such an extraordinary cultivation method before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you keep impressing me," Diana said with an elegant smile, her graceful features lighting up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You wanna do it again?" Marcus asked with a mischievous grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was about to push him away, but Marcus pinned her down and kissed her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ah..." Just as her desires were fading, they reignited with a fierce blaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A soft warmth began to spread between her thighs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus parted her legs and thrust his cock into her pussy without hesitation. A sharp sound echoed as their bodies came together once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana felt completely overwhelmed, filled to the brim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Waves of ecstasy crashed over her again, leaving her breathless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus, equally consumed by passion, gripped her hips and began to move with an unrelenting rhythm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The room was soon filled with the symphony of their union, enveloped in an endless surge of desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their second round of passion burned fiercely, lasting for over an hour before finally subsiding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After cuming multiple times, Diana was left completely exhausted, barely conscious on the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though both of them had reached a state of physical and mental fulfillment, they noticed their cultivation levels hadn't advanced further this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This revealed that repeating the Dual Cultivation technique too soon only enhanced the experience without providing additional cultivation benefits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next morning, Marcus was practicing the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire in his room when there was a knock at the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When he opened it, he found Jane standing there, impeccably dressed and made up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane seemed to have gone out of her way to dress up today. Though she was over 30, the years had left barely a trace on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, her maturity only added to her charm, perfectly complementing her elegant demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There was no denying it&mdash;despite her flirtatious nature, Jane was an absolute stunner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From her striking looks to her skills in the bedroom, she was in a league of her own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What's up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' gaze briefly swept over Jane's curvaceous figure before he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Honey, don't tell me you've forgotten. Tomorrow's my dad's 70th birthday party. We're supposed to leave for Ganston today&mdash;it's a few hundred miles away, and leaving tomorrow won't give us enough time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane said, her gaze tinged with reproach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Oh, I thought it was tomorrow. Didn't realize we needed to leave today. Let me get ready then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus suddenly remembered Jane had mentioned this to him a few days ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hadn't been as thoughtful as her, assuming tomorrow would be fine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Seems like Diana has you completely distracted. You've forgotten all about my plans." Jane shot Marcus an irritated look before slamming the door shut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus felt a headache coming on. He hadn't expected this slut to get jealous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a quick shower and changing into fresh clothes, he stepped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane was already waiting in the courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus had planned to drive his Aston Martin, but Jane objected. "That car's too cramped, and it's not comfortable. I get carsick easily. Let's take mine instead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane handed Marcus the keys to her BMW 5 Series.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While significantly less expensive than the Aston Martin, the mid-size luxury sedan offered far superior comfort for passengers compared to the sports car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus started the BMW and drove Jane away from Bayside Villa, heading straight onto the highway toward Ganston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Solomia was about 310 miles from Ganston. It was 10:00 AM now. They wouldn't arrive until at least 3:00 PM.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus switched on the adaptive cruise control and kept one hand on the steering wheel, enjoying the scenery passing by outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The car had barely merged onto the highway when Jane's hand started to wander. Without hesitation, she slipped it right into his pants, boldly grabbing hold of his cock.</span></p><div class="pagination">
