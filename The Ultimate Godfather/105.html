  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back at Bayside Villa, Marcus went straight to his room and entered his cultivation state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He began practicing the two kinds of magic, Fireball and Lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through this period of cultivation, the power of these two spells had further improved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus estimated that, at his current level, unleashing the full force of these spells could pose a threat even to an Ancient Martial Stage Two expert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, he further practiced the "Celestial Reversal" technique.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although this technique was a bonus reward for cultivating the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, it still required skill and finesse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only through continuous practice could he genuinely master it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For three consecutive days, Marcus dedicated himself to honing these three techniques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the third day, his Fireball and Lightning had shown significant progress, capable of quickly obliterating even the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Two expert!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had also gained proficiency in Celestial Reversal. From initially deflecting ping pong balls, he progressed to deflecting cold weapons and, eventually, even attacks many times stronger than his own!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, achieving this level of deflection came at a significant cost to his Numinous Energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a single maximum-strength deflection, Marcus estimated he would be completely drained, losing all combat effectiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, this ultimate deflection was a last resort, a life-saving technique. Using it carelessly could leave him vulnerable to a counterattack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the third day, Marcus arrived at Serpent's Coil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was there to evaluate Jalen's progress with the Magic Codex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps due to what went down at Yolanda Village, Jalen's fear of Marcus had reached new heights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His motivation to perform had skyrocketed accordingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, Jalen could recite the Magic Codex backward and forwards and had even mastered essential control over fire and lightning elements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though these skills were only for show at this point, it proved he had the potential to learn more advanced magic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus praised Jalen and ordered him to share his knowledge of the Magic Codex with the other Serpent's Coil members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus understood the balance of carrot and stick. It was how you built loyalty among your followers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Energized by the praise, Jalen threw himself into teaching the Magic Codex day and night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The knowledge spread like wildfire through their ranks!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a few days, every member of Serpent's Coil could recite the Magic Codex from memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of the more gifted ones could even perform one or two witchcrafts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Jalen had mastered the basics so thoroughly, Marcus rewarded him by teaching him Lightning and Fireball spells.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overjoyed, Jalen dove into practicing with renewed intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus noticed that while Jalen usually focused on combat, he showed remarkable aptitude when he applied himself to learning something new.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By his estimation, Jalen would master Lightning and Fireball within a month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When that happened, Marcus would have his first Wizard subordinate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time went on, more Wizards would join their ranks, potentially forming an entire magic battalion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was thrilled at the prospect of building this magical army.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Kingston Brown Manor, patriarch Ricardo was seething with rage upon receiving news of Jared's death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Those bastards dare to kill a member of the Brown family!" Ricardo roared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His anger exploded like a volcano.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After comparing the security footage from Jared's villa with that from the Brown Manor in Kingston, Ricardo made a shocking discovery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person who killed his son Leo was the same one who murdered Jared!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricardo's fury intensified, regretting that he hadn't eliminated Marcus when he had the chance, which led to these dire consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Buzz..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a screen in Ricardo's secret chamber began flickering wildly before displaying the image of a tall man with golden hair and blue eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricardo's eyes narrowed before widening in surprise. "Mr. Roger Gellar, is that you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He recognized the man's identity and immediately became deferential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's me." the man on the screen nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even through the display, his aura of authority was unmistakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What can I do for you, Mr. Gellar?" Ricardo asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill my brother. Do this to my satisfaction, and I'll elevate the Brown family to Uswad's most powerful dynasty," the man on screen declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your brother... would that be Marcus, the one who killed my son?" Ricardo ventured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricardo's mind raced with a bold theory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His instincts had given him the answer, and his heart began to pound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're sharp. Since he killed your son, you'll seek revenge anyway. Complete this quickly, and the rewards for the Brown family will last generations," the man stated, his ice-blue eyes glinting with deadly intent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Mr. Gellar, Marcus won't be breathing for long!" Ricardo promised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger nodded once, then the display flickered, and his image vanished utterly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger Gellar was Godfather's second son!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even for a power player like Ricardo, this was his first glimpse of Roger's true face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He'd only heard of him through whispers and rumors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Never in his wildest dreams did Ricardo expect Roger to reach out to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he could fulfill Roger's request, the Brown family would claim the throne as Uswad's most powerful dynasty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The prospect made Ricardo's heart race with ambition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, he didn't doubt the promise for a second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, this was the Godfather's son, a man whose father was the most influential figure on the planet, someone who could change countless lives with a single word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though the Brown family commanded respect in Uswad, they were nothing compared to the Godfather's influence.</span></p><div class="pagination">
