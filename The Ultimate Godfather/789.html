        <h1>Chapter 782 Ignore Attack-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one in the room, certainly not Travis, could go toe-to-toe with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Liam's blunt words had the opposite effect of what he intended. Travis' anger flared, his face reddening with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but let out a harsh laugh. "Liam, I actually thought of you as a close friend, but now I see how wrong I was. You've been jealous of me all along, jealous of how much stronger I am."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took a step forward, his eyes narrowing with contempt. "Now that I've broken through to Ancient Martial Stage Nine, instead of offering congratulations, you're using this kid to try to put me down?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Travis' voice dripped with disdain. "Do you really think I'm going to fall for your nonsense? This kid is barely in his twenties. No matter how gifted he is, how powerful could he possibly be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He crossed his arms, his tone brimming with arrogance. "I'm the fastest-growing martial artist in the entire world of Ancient Martial Art. There's no way this kid's training is faster than mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Liam, realizing it was pointless to argue with someone this deluded, sighed in exasperation. "If you really think I'm just jealous, then fine. Do whatever you want. But when Mr. Fitzgerald crushes you, don't come running to me for help."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Travis' expression twisted into a sneer. "Don't worry about me. Even if I die, I won't </span><span>come begging you. This kid will be the one kneeling at my feet, begging for mercy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned his icy gaze back to Marcus, a cruel smile spreading across his face. "I never thought someone so worthless would get someone like Liam to back him up. I'm curious to see just what you're made of."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With those words, Travis' aura flared to life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A suffocating pressure filled the air, the sheer force of it making the crowd uneasy. His palm crackled with raw energy, a destructive force gathering in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without warning, he unleashed a devastating hand strike, a concentrated burst of all the power he could muster from Ancient Martial Stage Nine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The attack came down like a storm, overwhelming and relentless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers held their breath, hearts racing. The power of an Ancient Martial Stage Nine practitioner was undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some even whispered that Travis might actually be stronger than Alonzo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hand Strike seemed to tear through the air, its destructive force descending on Marcus in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus' expression remained unchanged&mdash;he didn't even flinch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body stood as still as a statue, showing no sign of trying to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the strike neared, something strange happened. A soft, almost imperceptible glow flickered around Marcus' body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was faint, gentle even, but it was enough to completely block Travis' powerful strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boom!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force of Travis' attack landed, but Marcus' body didn't budge an inch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Travis froze, his eyes narrowing in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't fathom it. How had Marcus managed to shrug off his attack?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had poured everything he had into that strike&mdash;no ordinary practitioner of Ancient Martial Stage Nine would dare ignore it. Yet here stood Marcus, completely untouched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You actually managed to ignore my attack?" Travis' voice dripped with astonishment. "What kind of treasure are you wearing? How else could your defense be this strong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, there was no way someone like Marcus could just walk through that attack. Everything he had seen so far defied logic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd shared Travis' surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strike was no small feat, and though they knew Marcus was strong, they couldn't understand how he had withstood it without so much as a scratch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' lips curled into a smirk. "Against someone like you? Do I really need treasure? You've got an inflated sense of yourself if you think that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the words left his mouth, a powerful shockwave erupted from Marcus' body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy exploded outward, crashing toward Travis with blinding speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than a second, it was on him&mdash;an overwhelming force, born from Marcus' sheer will and strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Travis' face went pale as the overwhelming sense of danger hit him. He tried desperately to summon his own energy to counter the incoming force, but it was </span><span>useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shockwave Marcus unleashed was too powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It shattered Travis' defenses as if they were nothing more than glass, and before he could react, the blast sent him flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A scream of agony ripped through the air as Travis' body was hurled backward like a ragdoll, crashing into a nearby Ice Wall with a sickening thud. The impact was so brutal that the wall itself cracked under the force.</span></p></div>
