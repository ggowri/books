  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm at Acquired State Three. You're not even in the same league as the guy you just killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With a single move, I could easily kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the Grandmaster, Norman Tucker, spoke, he started to channel his energy, preparing to strike at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on." Marcus raised his hand, signaling him to stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Tucker family members froze for a moment, then their gazes turned cold and mocking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norman sneered, "What's wrong? Are you afraid now? If you're scared, then surrender and lower your cultivation to show repentance. Maybe, if you beg for your life sincerely, I'll spare you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others from the Tucker family broke into laughter, their faces twisted with cruel sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since the Grandmaster is giving you a chance, you'd better take it," Yasser added with contempt. "Once you've angered him, you'll have no place to die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie's face tightened with worry as she looked at Marcus, unsure of why he had stopped Norman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, just gave a strange smile, completely ignoring Yasser's taunts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned to Norman and said casually, "What I meant is, you are no match for me. Why not send all three of you at me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Tucker family members were stunned for a moment, and then their expressions twisted into mocking grins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yasser laughed in disbelief, "Are you out of your mind? Our Grandmaster alone can crush you! And now you want all three of them to take you on? You're begging for death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Others in the family shared similar thoughts. They were confident that just one of their Grandmasters could easily wipe out Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when they heard what Marcus said, Norman's expression darkened, his eyes burning with fury.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For someone who had lived for centuries, this was the first time he had been disrespected like this by a mere junior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His teeth clenched with rage. "You're the most arrogant young man I've ever met. Fine, I'll show you what it means to face an expert at Acquired State Three. Prepare to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a cold laugh, Norman's aura exploded, filling the air with a heavy, suffocating pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The space around them seemed to shrink as the weight of his presence bore down on everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next instant, the pressure intensified, enveloping Marcus and Gertie entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gertie gasped, feeling as though her body was being crushed by an invisible weight, her breath coming in short, painful gasps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norman flicked his wrist, and a dark, destructive light surged from his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a single step forward, he conjured a massive, terrifying palm print in the air, which morphed into a monstrous, ancient beast, its jaws wide open, closing in on Marcus like a death sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire area seemed to vibrate with the overwhelming force of the attack, and the crowd shuddered in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Norman's strength was on a whole other level compared to the previous Howard, and the difference was palpable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though both were at the Return Essence stage, their power was not even in the same league.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Norman's strength, it was clear he could crush Howard with just a wave of his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're about to die by my hand," Norman sneered, his voice dripping with arrogance. "Even in death, you should feel honored!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he poured even more energy into the attack, intensifying its power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't seriously think your attack is strong, do you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus wasn't fazed in the least by Norman's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the attack could land, he casually threw a punch, his movements unhurried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was only using twenty percent of his power, but that was enough to make Norman's attack seem like nothing.</span></p><div class="pagination">
