        <h1>Chapter 66 My Woman</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dozens of men in black armed with submachine guns came quickly and surrounded Leo, Haley, and others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen walked in the middle of the crowd. Under everyone's gaze, he said to Marcus respectfully, "Mr. Fitzgerald, I'm late in coming to your rescue. Please forgive me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Never mind." Marcus waved at Jalen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo and Haley both looked exceedingly terrible, especially Leo, who had been so arrogant before but was pointed at by dozens of submachine guns now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's true that you are from Kingston, but Solomia has its own rules. Don't be too arrogant. As the saying goes, the nail that sticks up gets hammered down." sneered Marcus, coming to Leo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo looked angry, but he held back from refutation and didn't even dare to move his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were dozens of submachine guns, and any one of them could turn him into a sieve if it went off accidentally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Leo was from the Brown family in Kingston and had a high status, he could not escape the fear when facing death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you. It's not that I can't kill you. I just didn't care about you. But today, you completely angered me, and you must pay the price." With that, Marcus raised his right hand. Jalen understood what he meant immediately and handed him a submachine gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Marcus fired without hesitation, and intensive gunfire echoed in the nightclub.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haley's body was wildly shaking as bullets kept penetrating through it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, a pungent smell of blood filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haley widened his eyes, his face full of despair, and his body fell straight down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before this, he would never have imagined that a visit to a nightclub would turn out to be his doom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole place was silent, and many people were so frightened that their bodies were utterly petrified.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had never expected that someone would actually dare to kill someone in a nightclub, and the person being killed was Haley, the heir of TreatMed Pharmaceuticals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Jalen was stunned, thinking, "I am called a desperado by the world. But when it comes to killing people, I feel inferior to Mr. Fitzgerald. Mr. Fitzgerald is so cruel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as he has the intention to kill, he will not hesitate. No matter who the other party is or what the occasion is, he dares to take action. It is the actual killing without hesitation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Haley on the ground, Leo, who had been arrogant, became completely scared. His body kept shaking, and the look he gave Marcus also changed from arrogance to fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Marcus turned the gun and aimed it at Leo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, gunshots rang out again, hitting the drinking table next to Leo this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the dense bullet fire, the bottles and jars on the table were shattered and flew everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For Leo, this sound was like a death knell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mentality completely collapsed, and he actually wet his pants in fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo held his head and wailed in fear, saying, "Don't...Don't kill me. I know I was wrong. I don't want to die yet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" A thunderous sound came out of Marcus' mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo was shocked and immediately shut up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus showed a sarcastic smile, saying, "You were so arrogant before, so I thought you were a big shot. But I didn't expect you to be so spineless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those words did not contain any dirty ones, but it was full of Marcus' disdain and sarcasm towards Leo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo gritted his teeth. His heart was filled with hatred and humiliation, but he didn't dare to look Marcus in the eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black muzzle of a gun was the source of his arrogance, but it had become a shadow in his life now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Brown is from the Brown family in Kingston. How dare you insult him like this? Aren't you afraid of revenge from the Brown family?" one of Leo's men couldn't bear it any longer and said with gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck you. You are so arrogant. The Brown family is nothing in front of Mr. Fitzgerald," said Jalen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if to show himself, he stepped forward and kicked the man who had spoken to the ground. Then, he and his henchmen started punching and kicking the man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was beaten badly and covered in blood at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the miserable appearance of that man, Leo turned pale, and his body trembled with Jalen's every punch as if he were the one being beaten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, the man had his tendons in his hands and feet cut by Jalen and was thrown aside to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere was highly depressing. No one in the nightclub dared to speak. Even Dave was scared silly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was delighted that he had answered Jalen's call just now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, his fate might be even more miserable than Haley's if he offended Marcus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus looked at Leo and warned, "She is my woman. You are so brave that you dare to let her drink with you."</span></p></div>
