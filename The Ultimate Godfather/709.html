        <h1>Chapter 708 I Do</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, harder. I can't take it anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila let out a series of sounds, and her face turned an even deeper shade of red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, of course, was willing to fulfill Lila's desires.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a roar, he immediately channeled the full power of Dual Cultivation, pushing it to its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He began to thrust more violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, due to the angle, the force and frequency were unprecedented.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Lila reach her climax again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila let out an even more enticing sound, and the liquid soaked the entire bedsheet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't bear it anymore, and under the stimulation of the contraction, he finally erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila trembled constantly, her entire being surrounded by a sense of bliss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her skin, already smooth and glowing, seemed to shine even brighter after being nourished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It carried a rosy tint, making her look incredibly enticing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus held her in his arms and kissed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila was completely satisfied, still letting out soft sounds from her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stopped kissing her and asked, "Are you comfortable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila subconsciously nodded and said, "Yes..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at the next moment, it seemed like she had regained her composure. She shot Marcus a stern look and said, "Mr. Fitzgerald, you can't say things like that again. I felt so embarrassed just now. You saw everything about me. Now, there are no secrets left between us..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus laughed heartily and said, "We're a couple now. Isn't that perfectly normal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila blinked her beautiful eyes, a look of surprise on her face as she asked, "So, I'm your girlfriend now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled and asked, "What else would you be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila blushed and said, "I know that someone as excellent as you must be surrounded by women, so I never dared to think of myself as your girlfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although I said you were my boyfriend when we had dinner with my stepmother, I never really felt sure. I didn't know if you truly wanted to accept me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus pulled Lila into his arms, gently stroking her silky hair, and said, "Of course, you're my girlfriend. Unless you don't want to be."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila raised her hand to cover Marcus' mouth, whispering, "I do want to be. So, can I call you Marcus from now on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded with a smile. "Of course."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus... can you be gentler to me next time? I feel so hot there. It seems like you broke it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila gave a seductive glance, her voice barely more than a whisper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow slightly and said, "Then let me check and see if it's really broken."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he said that, he wanted to spread Lila's legs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila's delicate face turned even redder, and she tightly pressed her legs together, saying, "Don't look. It's so embarrassing..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why? I've seen everything about you before. Besides, wasn't it you who asked me to move harder? You kept asking me for that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila felt as if she wanted to disappear. She couldn't understand why she had said such embarrassing things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't like her at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after thinking for a moment, she realized that she had indeed acted quite wildly just now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she kept asking him to speed up and move harder...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh... I'm so embarrassed... I can't face you now..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila buried her head under the blanket, utterly embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus immediately crawled into the bed and kissed her again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His large hand smoothly moved to caress her breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a moment, Lila once again experienced that tingling sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made her fall into endless desire once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you are so bad... Didn't we just do it? Why are you still doing this to me?" Lila asked while panting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said with a smile, "Once is never enough. We need to go for a second round!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, Marcus once again spread Lila's legs apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he thrust his penis into her vagina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila was caught off guard and was filled up again. She only felt a sudden sense of expansion, almost causing her to faint on the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More liquid began to seep out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling her reactions, Marcus felt comfortable and began to move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the friction continued, Lila's reactions became more intense, and she quickly got into the rhythm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She moaned even louder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Marcus endured for a full two hours before it finally exploded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the intense stimulation, Lila fainted completely, not regaining consciousness until nine AM the next day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, Marcus was fully immersed in his cultivation state. He solidified his position at Ancient Martial Stage Nine and raised to Level Six Wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His overall strength had made a notable improvement.</span><span> </span></p></div>
