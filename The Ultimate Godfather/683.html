  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bloodthirsty Cult!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus heard this name, his eyes turned icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, Yvonne fell victim to a Blood Curse cast by the Bloodthirsty Cult. She was on the verge of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus single-handedly infiltrated their stronghold close to Solomia. He killed the priest and then, using the priest's blood, managed to save Yvonne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since all those who had attacked her had been eliminated by him, he didn't take this force seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, they were extremely ambitious. They were trying to extend their influence in the world of Ancient Martial Art in Uswad and had even targeted the Celestial Arc Order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This indicated that in the recent period, the members of the Bloodthirsty Cult must have been moving about secretly in Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why, have you dealt with them, too?" Ada asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Last time, they attacked my friend to lure me into a trap, but I killed them all!" Marcus replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How could they be so audacious? Is there some powerful figure backing them?" Ada asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' strength was so terrifying, yet these people still provoked him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She believed that they had a backer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They were instructed by Mr. Roger Gellar," Marcus replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Roger Gellar!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mention of the name made Ada's heart flutter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something immediately occurred to her. She glanced at Marcus with wide eyes and asked, "Then, what is your relationship with the Godfather?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The answer was already in her head, but she just couldn't bring herself to confirm it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, several auras emerged from the void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bursts of blood-red light flickered in the sky.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately afterwards, three figures descended in front of Marcus and Ada.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were dressed in extremely strange clothes and shrouded in blood-red radiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon their arrival, they activated an illusion Rune to cover the area, causing everything within to change instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, it seemed to them that they were not at the gate of Solomia University but rather in an extremely desolate and wild expanse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After reaching a certain level, warriors and Curse Weavers from Southvaia would employ the illusion Rune to conceal the battlefield when engaging in combat in the mundane world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only by doing so could they ensure that the normal lives of people in the mundane world remained unaffected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Curse Weaver from the Bloodthirsty Cult mocked, "Bitch, you have nowhere to escape."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was adorned with a variety of mysterious totems, rendering it impossible to discern his true features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Combined with his strange outfit, he exuded an eerie and terrifying aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are haunting me. Don't you fear inciting a collective onslaught from the world of Ancient Martial Art in Uswad?" Ada asked through gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These three Curse Weavers from the Bloodthirsty Cult had been chasing her for three days and three nights.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were all at Level Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader's cultivation had reached the peak of Level Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada was no match for the three of them together. It was a miracle that she could escape all the way here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The world of Ancient Martial Art in Uswad?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Curse Weaver, at the peak of Level Seven, smiled sarcastically, "There are three major sects in the world of Ancient Martial Art in Uswad, and the leaders of two of them were killed. These sects have long been in name only. How dare you mention the world of Ancient Martial Art in Uswad? Don't you think it's ridiculous?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To tell you the truth, occupying the Celestial Arc Order is only the first step of the plan of the Bloodthirsty Cult. Subsequently, we will gradually dominate the entire world of Ancient Martial Art in Uswad and ultimately become the number one power in East Airsia!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words irritated Ada. She couldn't help but ask, "I am really curious about your identity in the Bloodthirsty Cult?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Curse Weaver, at the peak of Level Seven, replied, "We are three out of the four guardians of the leader of the Bloodthirsty Cult. However, even with just the three of us, we can effortlessly wipe out the world of Ancient Martial Art in Uswad..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, his laughter disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A set of golden bells materialized in his hand, and he shook them vigorously. All around him, a dreadful, blood-tinged aura surged forth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a dense swarm of black bugs emerged from the void and rapidly closed in on Ada from every direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These bugs were highly venomous. Even a minor bite from them could prove fatal in short order for someone whose cultivation level wasn't sufficient to fend off the toxins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada had been attacked by them before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Well aware of the formidable nature of these black bugs, she made an immediate retreat. However, she was just a bit too late, for they had already encircled her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They emitted a shrill, chirping noise and darted forward rapidly to bite her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Curse Weaver, at the peak of Level Seven, once again gave an order to the black bugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glint of blood-red light flickered in the eyes of the black bugs, and they launched themselves at Ada with even greater frenzy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face grew pale. Already badly injured, she didn't know how to protect herself.</span></p><div class="pagination">
