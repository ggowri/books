        <h1>Chapter 889 Saint's Stone</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The room was a symphony of sounds. Moans, cries, and the rhythmic thud of bodies filled the air, reaching a fever pitch of passion. It was a love song played out in the flesh.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' assault lasted a good half-hour. Diana, swept away by the intense pleasure, reached her peak three times. She teetered on the edge of oblivion as Marcus, in one final, powerful thrust, reached his climax. His body shuddered as he poured his seed into her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana seemed utterly sated as if she had been filled. A soft smile played on her lips, her expression one of blissful contentment.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus withdrew from her body, then rolled over and pulled her close. Diana snuggled against </span><span>him,</span><span> their bodies pressed together. Her long, smooth legs wrapped around his </span><span>torso,</span><span> her full breasts pressed against his chest. Marcus couldn't resist giving them another squeeze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, be gentle," Diana purred, giving Marcus a playful, sidelong glance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So soft and smooth," Marcus murmured, his hand continuing to caress her breast. "I could touch you forever."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald... please, I've had enough," Diana whispered, a hint of playful protest in her voice. Marcus had thoroughly worn her out, and she wasn't eager for another round just yet.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Alright, alright," Marcus chuckled, sitting up and heading to the bathroom for a quick shower. He emerged moments later, clad in a white bathrobe.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Returning to the edge of the bed, he made a gesture with his hand, a flicker of spatial force dancing across his palm. A moment later, a fist-sized purple crystal materialized in his hand.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crystal pulsed with an aura of magic, though it looked rough and unrefined as if its power hadn't been fully unlocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's eyes widened as she spotted the stone, a flash of excitement lighting up her </span><span>face. "Is that... a Saint's Stone?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Indeed," Marcus replied with a smile. "An unrefined Saint's Stone. With your cultivation and my help, you should be able to refine it and break through to the Saint Magician level."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana held the Saint's Stone in her palm, examining it closely. Her deep blue eyes shone with undisguised longing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald," she asked, "where did you find this?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was curious, to say the least. Diana had spent years searching for such a stone, even risking her life in dangerous expeditions to hidden realms, all to no avail. And now, Marcus presented her with one, albeit an unrefined one. Still, it was enough to astonish her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I recently killed a warrior named Damien," Marcus explained. "He was an old monster who had lived through ten cycles of samsara. I found this stone in his Spatial Ring.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"At first, I didn't know what it was," he continued. "But then I found some notes in Damien's Spatial Ring that described it as a Saint's Stone. Since Damien was a warrior, it was useless to him, so he kept it stored away, hoping to trade it for something more useful. But he never got the chance. He met his end at my hands," Marcus chuckled.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Normally, someone with his experience wouldn't have access to something like a Saint's Stone. If it weren't for the notes in Damien's Spatial Ring, Marcus might have mistaken it for a worthless rock. Luckily, Damien had a habit of keeping records, which allowed Marcus to identify the stone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When a wizard's cultivation reached the peak of Demon Fighter Stage Nine, a Saint's Stone was essential to break through to the Saint Magician level.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, thank you!" Diana </span><span>exclaimed,</span><span> her voice filled with emotion. Her eyes sparkled as she looked at Marcus.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I see your cultivation has already reached the peak of Demon Fighter, just a step away from Saint Magician," Marcus said. "With this Saint's Stone and my help, you can achieve that breakthrough today!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana's face lit up with excitement. Before she could speak, Marcus began to cast the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire. Streams of Timeless Numinous Energy flowed into the Saint's Stone, causing the magical light emanating from its surface to intensify.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not long after, the Saint's Stone levitated in Marcus' palm. He channeled Timeless Numinous Energy into it, beginning the refining process.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the energy flowed, the stone's glow intensified, bathing the room in a vibrant purple light. Impurities on the surface vanished at an almost visible rate.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Saint's Stone became brighter and more translucent, its flaws purged by Marcus' Timeless Warrior's Grimoire. Though a gradual process, it proceeded smoothly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Marcus' persistent effort, the Saint's Stone was completely refined. The magic within was not only pure but incredibly potent.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Success!" Diana's face beamed with surprise and delight at the sight. She was also stunned by Marcus' almost magical refining skills. Never in her wildest dreams had she imagined he possessed such powerful cultivation techniques.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This level of refinement was beyond her comprehension. In Diana's mind, the Saint's Stone was a revered object, and its refinement was complex and arduous. But in Marcus' hands, it seemed so effortless.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The cultivation method Marcus used, in particular, left Diana with a sense of unfathomable mystery.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This Saint's Stone has been completely refined," Marcus said to Diana. "Now, let me help you break through to the Saint Magician level!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded gently, taking the Saint's Stone Marcus offered her into her palm.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two sat cross-legged on the bed. Marcus quickly activated the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, resting his hands on Diana's back.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Streams of Timeless Numinous Energy flowed into her body, igniting a sensation of intense heat within her. At the same time, Diana began circulating her cultivation techniques.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A surge of magical energy swirled around her, coursing through her meridians in a rapid, cyclical flow. Magic also radiated from her palms, enveloping the Saint's Stone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She steadily absorbed the magical power within the stone, channeling it through her palms and energy channels. With the influx of this energy, Diana's aura steadily grew stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her body blazed with magical light, filling the entire space. Marcus' Timeless Numinous Energy gradually merged with this aura, nurturing Diana's organs and cells.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana fully cooperated with Marcus. Under the influence of the Saint's Stone, her body underwent visible transformations. This was directly related to Marcus' Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Timeless Warrior's Grimoire was a profound and comprehensive cultivation manual with potent healing properties. It could also greatly nourish the physical body, helping others break through bottlenecks and reach higher levels of cultivation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As more magical energy flowed into her, Diana's body became enveloped in a swirling purple mist.</span></p></div>
