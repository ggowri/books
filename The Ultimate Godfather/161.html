  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete chuckled dismissively, "The </span><span>Uswad</span><span> fighting champion? Is that supposed to be impressive? I'd suggest you travel the world a bit when you have free time, Mayor Benjamin, and stop staying stuck in your little bubble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin's face turned beet red with anger. Pete's arrogance was infuriating, and his audacity was even worse. Without hesitation, Benjamin ordered the final match to begin. Turning to Edward, he asked, "Edward, can I count on you to defeat Gibson and uphold the honor of </span><span>Uswad</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward's confidence was unwavering as he replied, "I won't let you down, Mayor Benjamin." Benjamin nodded in satisfaction, eager to witness Edward's victory over Gibson firsthand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before Benjamin's words had fully settled, Marcus' voice cut through the air. "Hold on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Benjamin turned to him with a hint of impatience. "What is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' gaze swept over Pete before landing back on Benjamin. With a sneer, Marcus said, "There's something wrong with Gibson. I suggest canceling this final match."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' words left everyone stunned. Even Maxine gave him a questioning look, unable to fathom why he'd suddenly make such a request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pete scoffed, his tone dripping with sarcasm, "What's the matter? Are you afraid </span><span>Uswad</span><span> might lose, so now you want to back out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus let out a derisive laugh. "You know why I'm making this suggestion. I don't want to expose the truth, so I'll give you a chance to quit while you're ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Pete could respond, a sharp voice rang out from beside him. A woman with glasses, strikingly attractive in her own way, stood abruptly. Her words were biting. "Who do you think you are to speak to Mr. Hudson like that? Mr. Hudson is a man of status and dignity, nothing like you lowlifes. Shut that filthy mouth of yours."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Alyssa Cox, a diplomat assigned to host Pete's party. Though she was from </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, Alyssa had been enamored with Weston Land culture since childhood. To her, Pete embodied the ideal gentleman, practically a flawless man. The Hudson family was a lineage she considered utterly unattainable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing someone dare to slander Pete in public, Alyssa wasted no time stepping in, hoping to win his favor in the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine, however, had had enough. Her voice was sharp and unyielding. "Marcus is an honored guest of our academy and the hero who took down two hijackers singlehandedly. Ms. Cox, mind your words."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alyssa looked as though she wanted to argue further, but Benjamin stopped her with a raised hand. Edward stepped forward and said, "Mr. Hudson is a noble of Eldoria's royal family. I trust he wouldn't resort to underhanded tricks. Let the match proceed as planned."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Edward, Marcus was only trying to stop the match because he didn't want to see him win the championship. Confident in his abilities, Edward believed defeating Gibson would be no trouble at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Edward insisting, Marcus could only shake his head and return to his seat, closing his eyes to rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before stepping into the ring, Edward approached Marcus, his tone laced with </span><span>provocation. "I know you don't want to see me win, but my victory is inevitable. Spare yourself the effort of playing these little tricks. If you're afraid I'll challenge you after I take the championship, I can call off our duel." Marcus ignored him entirely, keeping his eyes shut.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Edward left, Maxine turned to Marcus and asked, "Do you really think there's something wrong with Gibson?" She sounded skeptical but curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied nonchalantly, "He's a cyborg, not fully human. Edward's in for a rough fight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's eyes flickered with surprise, finding it hard to believe Marcus' words. She wondered, "Cyborgs? Do people like that really exist in this world? I feel like I've only ever seen them in movies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearby, Benjamin also had overheard Marcus' comment and glanced at him with a hint of disappointment in his eyes. Even though Benjamin didn't think much of Pete, the idea of Gibson being a cyborg sounded utterly absurd to him. Not only did Benjamin not believe it, but he also thought it was pure fantasy. But Marcus couldn't be bothered to explain himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the match began, and Edward came out swinging aggressively, eager to claim victory as quickly as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gibson, however, seemed unfazed. He exchanged a few perfunctory blows before activating a mechanism within his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment his mechanical enhancements came online, Gibson was a completely different fighter. His defense became nearly impenetrable, and his strength skyrocketed beyond human limits. Even as a national champion, Edward was utterly outmatched.</span></p><div class="pagination">
