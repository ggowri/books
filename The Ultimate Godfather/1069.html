        <h1>Chapter 967 Why Are You Asking This?-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, Chloe, Eulalia, and Isolde watched in shock as Thorne suddenly stood up from his seat and strode toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bowed deeply before him and pleaded, "I was blind, completely ignorant of who you are. I had no idea you were the head of SiliconWave Technologies and kept running my mouth. I was wrong&mdash;really, truly wrong. Please forgive me this time. I can't afford to lose my position as Sales Director!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this unfold, Chloe, Eulalia, and Isolde felt a chill run down their spines.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially Eulalia and Isolde&mdash;just moments ago, they had dismissed Marcus as nothing more than a low-level extra in the entertainment industry, someone not even worth comparing to Thorne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had eagerly flattered Thorne, constantly mocking Marcus to show where their loyalties lay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when Thorne had boasted about his net worth&mdash;a supposed 800 to 900 million&mdash;they had reacted as if they had just heard the most shocking number in existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now? That so-called "impressive fortune" meant absolutely nothing in front of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, SiliconWave Technologies was a multi-billion-dollar corporation with a valuation in the hundreds of billions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the head of the company, Marcus' wealth was beyond imagination&mdash;to him, 800 or 900 million was pocket change at best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, Thorne had all acted so self-important, parading around his wealth like it meant something in front of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thorne had assumed that with that much money, he could do whatever he pleased, looking down on everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in reality? His so-called "status" was utterly insignificant to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus wanted to, he could destroy Thorne's entire career with a single phone call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Eulalia and Isolde finally understood&mdash;Marcus had never taken Thorne seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, Thorne was nothing more than a clown, a pathetic little showman trying to impress an audience. And once Marcus had seen enough? He could crush him effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But despite Thorne's desperate pleas, Marcus' expression remained cold and unmoved.</span><br><span>"You already admitted to embezzlement and bribery," Marcus said, his tone indifferent. "And now you have the audacity to ask for forgiveness? Do you really think I'd let that slide?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thorne's face instantly turned to despair. "So, that means... there's no chance you'll let me off?" he asked, voice trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't like repeating myself," Marcus replied flatly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt nothing but disdain for people like Thorne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mere Sales Director&mdash;someone who should have been making 10 million a year at most&mdash;and yet, he had somehow amassed nearly a billion through corruption.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had zero sympathy for parasites like him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine. Fine! If you won't show me mercy, don't expect any from me either!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thorne sneered, his expression twisting with malice as he pulled out his phone and dialed a number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the call connected, Thorne spoke urgently, "Dad, I just got fired from SiliconWave Technologies. Their CEO is refusing to reinstate me, no matter what. Double the import tax on their company immediately. Make them pay for this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice on the other end was instantly enraged. "What? SiliconWave Technologies had the audacity to fire my son? Fine, I'll make them suffer for it. Consider it done!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, the person immediately agreed to Thorne's request&mdash;a clear sign of just how much he spoiled his son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thorne hung up the phone and turned to Marcus, his face full of smug satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I begged you to reinstate me, and you refused to show mercy," he sneered. "So now, I'm going to make sure you suffer for it. Bet you didn't see that coming, huh? My father is a senior executive at the Uswad Customs Office. Since you refused to reinstate me, I had him double the import tax on all of SiliconWave Technologies' shipments. Your company moves billions in goods every year. A 100% increase in tariffs? I don't need to do the math for you. You know exactly how much money you're about to lose. Even with all your wealth, this is going to be a massive financial hit. And don't even think about begging me now&mdash;you made your choice, now you'll pay for it!"</span></p></div>
