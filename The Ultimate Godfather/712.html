  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie explained to Payne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalie, stop trying to fool me. I may love drinking, but I'm not that easy to deceive. How could I not know about your mom's condition?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two-thirds of her stomach was removed, and she can only rely on medication to survive. To be blunt, she doesn't have much time left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The hospital couldn't do anything. This kid is about the same age as you, and you expect me to believe he cured your mom's illness? I don't buy it!" Payne said with a look of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He spent his days idly, drinking and occasionally gambling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recently, he hadn't even visited Mia in the hospital, so naturally, he had no idea about her actual condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He still thought that Mia's condition was the same as before, where she needed to be hospitalized every now and then for treatment, just to be discharged and maintain her health.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never imagined that Mia's illness had been completely cured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, I'm not lying to you. Mom is really cured. Look at this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie handed over Mia's medical report to Payne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Payne took the report and examined it closely. A look of surprise immediately spread across his face. "Oh, your </span><span>mom's</span><span> really cured?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie nodded firmly. "Yes, Dad. Mom doesn't need to stay in the hospital anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A joyful smile appeared on Natalie's face as she spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For so many years, she had endured so much hardship to treat her mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their family had lived in the shadows because of Mia's illness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But from today on, they could finally live a normal life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie's smile was genuine when she thought about this, and she couldn't help but glance at Marcus with a grateful expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't expect this kid to be so capable!" Payne said, also casting a more favorable look at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalie, Dad, what did you say? Mom's illness is cured?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edwin, who had been playing games in his room, walked out and asked in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie didn't speak but simply handed him the medical report.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edwin took it and immediately showed a look of shock on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalie, do you mean this guy is the one who cured Mom's illness?" Edwin asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie nodded again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edwin was stunned, but he just looked at Marcus for a few moments before falling silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no sign of gratitude on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalie, even though this guy has good medical skills and cured your mom's illness, I don't think he can get close to you. I told you before without five million dollars, he's not coming into our family!" Payne said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In recent years, Payne had lost his job, and his business had gone bankrupt. All the family's money had gone toward Mia's medical treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Payne was tired of living in poverty. Now, Natalie was his only hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted her to marry a wealthy man who could provide a generous wedding gift to change their financial situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Natalie, I think Dad is right. Even if he cured Mom's illness, we can thank him, but if he wants to marry you, he needs money!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't forget, I'm counting on you to get me a wife, so you have to marry a rich man. He doesn't seem like someone who can provide five million dollars. I suggest you break up with him soon," Edwin also spoke up, expressing his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edwin's words showed his true nature. He was just like his father, snobbish and shallow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he was a parasite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't try to improve himself and relied entirely on Natalie to support him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even expected her wedding gift to secure his own future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Edwin, how can you say that? Don't say things like that. Marcus is my lifesaver. I think he's a good kid, even if he's not as rich as you want, but he's reliable. He'll take good care of your sister, and that's enough for me," Mia said to Edwin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's useless if he doesn't have money! You women just don't understand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if he's a good person, what can he do without money? What, are we going to starve for the rest of our lives?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm the head of this family. I make the decisions. If he can't come up with a five-million-dollar wedding gift, no matter who he is, he's not marrying Natalie!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Mia's words, Payne shot back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Mia could argue further about Marcus' merits, the doorbell rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edwin immediately got up to answer it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he opened the door, he was surprised to see a flamboyantly dressed middle-aged woman standing outside, accompanied by a man who looked to be in his thirties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was less than five feet seven inches tall and had a bit of a receding hairline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he seemed to have made an effort to dress neatly, his clothes instantly looked out of place on him due to his unremarkable appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, his appearance was far from good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt, why are you here?" Edwin asked, surprised to see the middle-aged woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman was none other than Payne's younger sister, Natalie and Edwin's aunt, Cora Vance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cora smiled and said, "I heard your mom was in the hospital, so I came to check on her. I also brought someone to introduce to your sister."</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
