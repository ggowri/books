  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just then, someone took Gary's wrist directly in a large hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary was stunned to see Marcus show up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you? How dare you meddle in my affairs? Let go of me right now, or I'll kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a bang, Marcus grabbed Gary's wrist and slapped Gary harshly across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary's nose was bleeding all of a sudden from being slapped, and his back teeth were even broken off, looking utterly miserable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How dare you slap me? I have to get you killed today..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary was furious. He was the general manager of the Rising Logistics Company, who was also a well-known person in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the bosses from all those large companies had to respect Gary, Marcus had the nerve to hit him, which immediately made him want to kill Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before Gary could finish speaking, Marcus slapped him again, and the other side of his face was red and swollen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary screamed and struggled to get up, but Marcus didn't give him a chance and kicked him in the stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary yelled again, but he was kicked straight out of the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body slammed into several of his fellows. His fellows were knocked straight to the ground by him, screaming miserably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene looked complicated, but it was actually just something that happened in a few seconds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone present couldn't help but look stunned as their gazes fell on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In particular, those who came to watch the fun were guessing Marcus' identity in their minds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you're finally here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Marcus show up, Darian felt as if he had found his backbone, and a hint of a satisfied smile appeared on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ramona and Kiera did the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you," Marcus turned to Darian and smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darian grinned and said, "I'm alright, and it's my honor to work for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus turned around and walked up to Kiera. Looking at Kiera's swollen cheek, Marcus touched it, and a sense of guilt welled up in his mind suddenly. "Does it hurt?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiera shook her head slightly. Seeing Marcus again, she couldn't help but feel her heart racing, and the ambiguous image of Marcus curing her came to her mind uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darian and Ramona, of course, noticed this scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could see a knowing smile on each other's faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're Mr. Fitzgerald that Darian has mentioned, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary staggered to his feet and asked Marcus coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, the pain on his face made him grimace instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to his appearance, Gary's subordinates stopped attacking, and all of their gazes fell on Marcus indifferently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> you're the backer that Darian has talked about. You were so bold to hit me, but I have to make you pay today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary said through gritted teeth. As he spoke, he waved his hand once again to the subordinates behind him and added, "Guys, not only did this asshole hit me, but he provoked our Rising Logistics Company's status. Beat him to death, and if anything happens, I'll take the blame!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No sooner had he finished speaking than Gary's subordinates got ready and rushed towards Marcus, waving their weapons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were at least hundreds of them, and they were all carrying weapons. For ordinary people, this was absolutely devastating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This young man was so bold that he even dared to hit Gary. He's screwed. With so many people attacking him, he'll be seriously injured even if he doesn't get killed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, Tim will support Gary. Even if we do beat this young man to death here, maybe no one will dare to do anything about it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, no, he's screwed. He just stuck his neck out. I </span><span>wanna</span><span> see how he's </span><span>gonna</span><span> die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was discussing as they saw a bunch of people attacking Marcus violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way they looked at Marcus showed compassion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their opinion, Marcus had offended Gary, so it was inevitable that he wouldn't have a good ending anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as soon as everyone had finished speaking, they heard the constant sound of muffled thuds accompanied by mournful screams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite the large number of Gary's subordinates and the weapons they all held in their hands, they were a piece of cake for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus just randomly swung his fists to knock them to the ground continuously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just after two minutes, everyone Gary brought with him fell to the ground and wailed in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene immediately dumbfounded everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was stunned in place, and their eyes were filled with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? How could that happen? Why is this young man so formidable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah. They all had weapons in their hands, but they were all beaten to the ground by him. I've only seen this kind of scene in movies before, and he was just so amazing. No wonder this young man dared to beat Gary in public!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A large number of people murmured as they were shocked by the terrifying power shown by Marcus.</span></p><div class="pagination">
