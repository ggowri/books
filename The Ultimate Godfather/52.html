  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haley's last remark was practically a direct provocation aimed at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You!" Yvonne said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haley's brazen behavior left Yvonne fuming, but she had no retort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't count on Marcus to produce a more lavish gift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yvonne, stop making a fuss! Mr. Brown has shown such sincerity. What more do you want?" Emily reprimanded Yvonne sharply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the moment Marcus entered the house, Emily had taken a disliking to him. In her eyes, someone like Haley was the right match for Yvonne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne turned her gaze toward Charles, hoping for his support. But Charles found himself caught between a rock and a hard place. Unsure of what to do, he chose not to take a stand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On one hand, Haley's gifts were extravagant; on the other, their family's pharmaceutical sales company relied heavily on business with TreatMed Pharmaceuticals. He couldn't afford to offend them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seizing the opportunity, Haley stood up, approached Yvonne, and tried to grab her arm, attempting to pull her from her seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne resisted and tried to shake off his hand, but Haley forced her back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt utterly helpless, her despair deepening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this critical moment, her own parents stood by passively, allowing her to be bullied by others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne's heart ached as she cast a pleading look toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go!" Unable to watch any longer, Marcus grabbed Haley's wrist, forcibly pulling his arm away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hillbilly, what do you think you're doing? Meddling in my business? Do you have a death wish?" Haley's face turned fierce as he issued his threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected Marcus to intervene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The black-suited men behind Haley tensed, preparing to take action against Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You just said that whoever offers the more generous gift gets to be Yvonne's boyfriend, correct?" Marcus ignored the looming threat of the bodyguards and calmly addressed Haley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A mocking smile appeared on Haley's face. "That's right. Don't tell me you're claiming you can offer a more extravagant gift?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert joined in, laughing, "Young man, stop pretending. The items Mr. Brown presented are priceless treasures, not to mention the 100 million dollars in cash. Even if you scraped together everything your family owns, it wouldn't come close to this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smirked in disdain. "A hundred million dollars. Is that supposed to be impressive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he made a quick call to Diana and then casually sat back down beside Yvonne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you think one phone call is going to conjure up 100 million dollars in cash? What a ridiculous fantasy." Haley let out a cold laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert turned to Charles, snickering. "Charles, is this the great son-in-law you've been talking up? I suggest sending him straight to a mental hospital&mdash;this is beyond absurd!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles flushed red with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no doubts about Marcus's medical expertise, but the idea of summoning more lavish gifts with a single phone call was something he couldn't believe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, right? I understand you like Yvonne, but relationships need to be grounded in compatibility. You two simply aren't suited for each other, so stop clinging to her. And don't bother with these little delaying tactics!" Emily planted her hands on her hips and launched into a tirade against Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To her, his phone call was nothing but a stalling tactic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The idea that he could outdo Haley's gifts was laughable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne shook her head helplessly, already regretting bringing Marcus home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt his sort of empty posturing would only make her look even worse in front of Haley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By my estimate, it'll take no more than 15 minutes," Marcus said nonchalantly, glancing at his watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fifteen minutes? Perfect. I'll give you that time. But if you can't produce more generous gifts, not only will Yvonne belong to me, but I'll also make you pay for what you did earlier!" Haley sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was eager to see what kind of trick this country bumpkin could pull.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly, fifteen minutes. Then we'll deal with him," Robert chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haley placed his phone on the table, set a timer, and activated the countdown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fifteen minutes flew by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Haley retrieved his phone and prepared to speak, the door to the villa swung open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana walked ahead, followed by more than a dozen stunning women dressed in golden leather skirts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These women were not only sexy and enchanting, but each of them also carried a leather suitcase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With impeccable grace, they lined up before Marcus. "Mr. Fitzgerald!" they greeted in unison.</span></p><div class="pagination">
