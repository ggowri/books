        <h1>Chapter 117 Satisfy</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded in satisfaction. "Now that's more like it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he playfully smacked Josie on her firm backside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie shivered and glared at Marcus. "You're impossible..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled wickedly. "Didn't you just enjoy it a moment ago?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie covered Marcus's mouth. "Stop it! You're embarrassing me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Josie's bashful expression, Marcus laughed heartily before pinning her beneath him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus... I've had enough... I really can't... oh... ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, the room was filled with passionate sounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus went at it three more times until Josie repeatedly begged for mercy. Only then did he stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Exhausted, Josie collapsed onto the bed and soon fell into a deep, peaceful sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus took a shower and was just about to lie down when he sensed a powerful telepathy envelop the entire building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, everything in the building seemed to fall under its control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus frowned, immediately realizing that this telepathy came from a highly skilled warrior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Telepathy was akin to a heightened sixth sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When a warrior reached Stage Three, they would develop their own telepathy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This telepathy could extend beyond the body, covering vast areas and perceiving everything within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like when Marcus first became a warrior and felt his senses sharpen exponentially.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the telepathy of a warrior was far more powerful than ordinary senses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Telepathy could cover an area extensively but couldn't replicate the function of X-ray vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The telepathy emanating now was terrifying, brimming with aggressive energy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus instantly understood that a formidable enemy was approaching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could even make an educated guess about the enemy's identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasting no time, Marcus quietly dressed. Seeing Josie still fast asleep, he didn't disturb her, locking the room behind him as he left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't linger and hailed a cab, heading toward the outskirts of Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the ride, the telepathy remained, precisely tracking his every move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arriving at a desolate mountain, Marcus stepped out of the cab and stood his ground. He shouted to the sky, "Show yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Buzz..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he finished speaking, a strange sound echoed from somewhere in the mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, a figure in a purple suit flickered into view, landing in front of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was none other than Ricardo Brown, the head of the Brown family in Kingston!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hahaha, as expected of the Godfather's third son&mdash;keen and fearless!" Ricardo laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricardo's gaze swept over Marcus, his laughter filled with approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had killed his son, igniting Ricardo's wrath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with the backing, Ricardo was even more determined to take Marcus's life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's eyes narrowed, and he looked slightly surprised. "How do you know I'm the Godfather's son?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your brother sent me to kill you. Of course, I know!" Ricardo said without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricardo continued, "You killed Jared and Leo. You're an enemy of the Brown family, and with me involved, you won't escape!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus suddenly understood&mdash;it was his estranged second brother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he didn't seem to care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had come to Kingston specifically to settle the score with Ricardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The current situation was exactly what Marcus had planned for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Resolving the matter in the desolate mountains meant no one else would be caught in the crossfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you willingly accept death, I'll leave your body intact!" Ricardo said arrogantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze brimmed with innate confidence as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His cultivation had reached the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Three, and to him, Marcus was just an insignificant insect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was certain that given the chance, he could kill Marcus with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think you've got me beat?" Marcus said, locking eyes with Ricardo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus never fought battles he wasn't confident of winning. He had already studied Ricardo's capabilities before coming to Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha, you seriously think killing a few of my men qualifies you to go up against me?" Ricardo sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ricardo burst into arrogant laughter. "Let me show you what the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Three can do!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the words had even faded, Ricardo took a step forward, his body transforming into an eerie blur.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The aura of a Stage Three peak martial artist erupted fully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a single strike, a massive palm shadow loomed over the space, sending sand and stones flying as it descended upon Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus roared, unleashing the&nbsp;Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, and countered with a full-force punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying shockwave reverberated, and Marcus felt an overwhelming force bearing down on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Marcus's punch carried immense power, it was no match for Ricardo's palm strike and was utterly destroyed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force sent Marcus staggering backward. His chest heaved, and blood surged up his throat, though he stubbornly swallowed it back down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the strength you're so proud of?" Ricardo mocked, standing still as a rock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ricardo remained motionless, delivering his taunt to Marcus.</span></p></div>
