        <h1>Chapter 308 Wake Her Up</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Everyone in the car looked at Marcus in puzzlement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted to try.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>People wondered if he was a doctor, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I told you. The patient is in danger and needs to rest. You'd better not make trouble. Otherwise, it will probably lead to the patient's illness getting worse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade refused to give way to Marcus and still treated the middle-aged woman in her own way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus said, "I said you will only accelerate the perforation of the appendix. Since you can't cure her, why don't you let me try?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He frowned, feeling more and more that Jade was too full of herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade said, "I am a surgeon at Solariae Hospital. And this is my work permit. Please don't challenge my expertise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Which hospital are you from? Which medical school did you graduate from? Show us your work permit! "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade showed her work permit directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was from Solariae Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many people looked at Jade respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Solariae Hospital could be ranked in the top five large general hospitals in Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The doctors who worked there were usually the cream of the medical profession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade was only in her twenties and was already the associate chief physician at Solariae Hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was a medical genius.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the man didn't look like a doctor at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He wanted to treat patients in the midst of acute appendicitis. Overreach!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone said, "Right. He must show us his work permit, or we will not allow him to fool around!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, he's not even qualified to practice medicine and shouldn't treat a patient who is seriously ill!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other people in the carriage were all in favor of Jade's decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this time, the middle-aged woman had fainted in pain and was in a state of severe shock!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This showed that her appendix had been completely perforated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If someone didn't take the necessary measures within ten minutes, the woman would probably not make it to the moment of getting off the train.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mom, wake up. Mom!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The boy was full of pain and kept shaking his mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But the middle-aged woman didn't respond at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade's face turned gloomy, and she quickly took a series of rescue measures for the middle-aged woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But none of these worked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Get out of the way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus could not stand it anymore, pushed Jade away, and put his palm directly against the woman's right lower abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The gentle Timeless Numinous Energy was released in his palm and penetrated into her abdominal cavity along the flesh of the middle-aged woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Timeless Numinous Energy directly wrapped around her perforated and purulent appendix.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Under the powerful healing effect of the Timeless Numinous Energy, the appendix, which had already festered and perforated, healed and recovered little by little!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In less than five minutes, the middle-aged woman's appendix returned to normal. She was even healthier than she was before her appendicitis!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It brought her face back to life, and her breathing gradually calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Then, the middle-aged woman who had already entered a state of severe shock miraculously woke up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Baby, where is this? Am I dead?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the woman woke up, she held her son's hand for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing his mother awake, the boy became excited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He said, "Mom, you didn't die. This gentleman saved you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The middle-aged woman looked at Marcus and said with gratitude, "Thank you for saving my life, sir!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She bowed and thanked Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus said, "Although your appendicitis has been cured, you are still very weak and need to recuperate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This magical scene shocked everyone in the place!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade froze and looked at Marcus in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She said, "He really knows medical skills and woke up a patient with appendicitis perforation and severe shock in less than five minutes. Incredible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Yes, the doctor has been questioning his medical qualification before. Without him, the woman may be in danger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's a miracle. My brother was also in severe shock due to appendicitis perforation. Our family lived in a mountainous area, so he didn't get timely treatment. He died before he was thirty. If we met this young man at that time, my brother would be saved!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd in the train car talked and looked at Marcus with admiration.</span></p></div>
