  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's Miles Donovan, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked, casting a quick glance across the room as he settled into his seat beside Chloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe barely looked in Miles' direction as she nodded. "Yeah. Executive VP of Royal Entertainment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Word is, he runs the place like his own personal kingdom. Bribes, backroom deals, trading favors with young actresses... Any truth to that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked, his tone light, almost conversational.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe gave a small nod but shot him a warning look, pressing a finger to her lips. "Keep your voice down. Saying that out loud isn't a great idea. I have a feeling Miles has someone powerful backing him&mdash;probably Mr. Death himself. Otherwise, he wouldn't be this untouchable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow at that.</span><br><span>Funny. No one has told me that Miles works for me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he let it slide, instead turning back to Chloe. "So, he's planning to hand Best Female Singer to the woman clinging to him, huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe's jaw tightened, frustration flashing across her face. "Yeah. Selena latched onto him the second she saw an opening."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you're just gonna sit back and let it happen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' tone was casual, but there was an edge to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had a soft spot for people like Chloe and Lila&mdash;people who refused to play by the industry's dirty rules.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And if a guy like Miles was running wild at Royal Entertainment, Marcus figured it was time to clean house. Since he was here, this awards ceremony was going to be fair&mdash;whether Miles liked it or not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And while Marcus was at it, he might as well take out the trash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not a chance," Chloe said, her voice firm. "I spent eight years working for this. I'm not handing it over. If Miles insists on rigging it, I'll expose him. Let the whole damn industry see what he really is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus leaned back in his seat, impressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He liked people who didn't back down. Chloe had been in this business long enough to get her hands dirty, but somehow, she hadn't. That alone made her worth respecting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Relax," he said smoothly. "I'm here. You're getting that award."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe's eyes flickered with something unreadable. She could tell he wasn't joking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she hesitated. "I know you mean well, but Miles isn't just some industry hack. If he really does have Mr. Death behind him, you don't want to get caught up in this. I don't want to drag you into my mess, Marcus. If something happened, I'd never forgive myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus tilted his head slightly. "What if I tell you I am Death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe blinked, then let out a soft laugh. "Come on. If you were Mr. Death, Royal Entertainment would be rolling out the red carpet. You own the place, remember?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She clearly wasn't buying it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ceremony kicked off soon after.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two impeccably dressed hosts took the stage, their voices smooth as they announced winner after winner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere buzzed with excitement as each awardee stepped up to claim their trophy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The presenters were all big names in the industry&mdash;directors, veteran actors, and music producers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then came the moment everyone was waiting for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And now," the female host announced with a dazzling smile, "the award for Best Female Singer in Uswad's entertainment industry goes to... Selena Marlowe!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A stunned silence rippled through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, all at once&mdash;uproar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the room knew Chloe deserved that award most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead, the organizers handed it to Selena. It wasn't just unfair&mdash;it was a slap in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A ripple of discontent spread through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people even spoke up in Chloe's defense, but it didn't matter. The decision had been made.</span></p><div class="pagination">
