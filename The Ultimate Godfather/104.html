  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had been ignoring Jared, that insignificant clown, but he hadn't expected the guy actually to try to sabotage him behind his back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These days, Marcus was pouring his heart and soul into establishing his pharmaceutical company. Anyone who dared to stand in his way would become his mortal enemy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen here, hotshot," sneered the burly thug who didn't recognize Marcus. "Kid, don't get too cocky. Insulting Mr. Brown like that... you must have a death wish!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't waste time with words. His fist connected before the man could finish his threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a loud bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thug went flying several meters through the air before crashing to the ground, lying motionless - whether dead or alive, nobody could tell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone froze, jaws dropping at the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially the law enforcement officers, they never dreamed Marcus would dare to throw the first punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they had the Brown family backing them. Even if Marcus was from Golden Group, he shouldn't have been so reckless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus swept his cold gaze over the officers. "Those seals you put up? Take them down exactly how you put them up. Then get the hell out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officers jumped like scared rabbits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having witnessed Marcus's power firsthand, they didn't dare defy him. They hurried to remove the seals and high-tailed it off the construction site.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The construction manager watched this scene unfold with a sense of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This must be Mr. Fitzgerald," he said, approaching Marcus with a respectful air. "You have quite the way with words, Mr. Fitzgerald!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Marcus was an investor in the pharmaceutical company and was eager to make a good impression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded at the construction manager with a smile, pleased with how he had handled the earlier situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, that guy destroyed all our permits. What should we do now?" the manager asked worriedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at the crowd and said, "Don't worry about any of this, I'll take care of it. Just focus on your work and carry on as usual!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The manager still hesitated. Starting work without proper procedures was illegal, and he was afraid of more trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the workers were all from out of town, paid by the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nobody wanted to waste time doing nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Marcus's words, they cheered and rushed back to their workstations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, the manager decided to let it go. After all, he had Marcus's guarantee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus immediately called Michelle, instructing her to process new construction permits at the relevant offices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle got right on it, leveraging her connections to get new permits processed that same afternoon and delivered to the site.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus then went alone to Jared's villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared, nearing fifty and missing an arm, was anything but old at heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Women were never in short supply around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he had no idea Marcus would show up. He was in bed, vigorously fucking a blonde-haired, blue-eyed beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman let out moans of pleasure, her chest heaving in rhythm with Jared's movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face glowed with wicked delight, clearly enjoying himself to the fullest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of Marcus's construction site being shut down soon filled Jared with joy, boosting his confidence and performance in bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the blonde beneath him reached a shuddering climax, her body convulsing as ecstasy overwhelmed her. Her release only served to fuel Jared further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Overcome with stimulation, he gave one final, furious effort before collapsing in satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Jared was reveling in his endless pleasure, a shadow silently appeared behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blonde beauty was the first to notice Marcus's sudden presence. She screamed, clutching the sheets to cover her alluring figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared instinctively turned his head and saw Marcus's cold, emotionless face. "You... how did you get in here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His villa was heavily guarded, with foreign mercenaries on duty. Even a fly would struggle to get inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to Marcus, those defenses were nothing more than child's play.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With minimal effort, he had slipped into the villa undetected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said nothing, his piercing gaze fixed on Jared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared shivered under his stare, his unease evident. He snorted coldly to mask his fear. "What the hell do you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus let out a chilling laugh. "Your life, of course."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared's face twisted in terror. Without hesitation, he reached under his pillow for a handgun, aiming to shoot Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus was faster. He snatched the gun effortlessly and pulled the trigger repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The silencer emitted soft, muffled pops. Jared's body convulsed with each shot, his gaze frozen in a lifeless stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you dare kill me... The Kingston Brown family won't let you get away with this..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jared's throat tightened as he forced out his final words, his body collapsing lifelessly onto the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blonde beauty was paralyzed with fear, her eyes squeezed shut and her body trembling uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she finally dared to open her eyes, Marcus had vanished without a trace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, Marcus hadn't planned to move against Jared so soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the fool had signed his death warrant. Marcus had no choice but to eliminate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It meant he'd officially burned his bridges with the Kingston branch of the Brown family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before this, their relationship had still been salvageable since they hadn't blamed him for Leo's vendetta.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with Jared dead by his hand, the Kingston Browns wouldn't let this slide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus wasn't afraid, though. The bad blood between him and the Kingston Browns had already reached the point of no return. A showdown was inevitable! It was better to have it sooner rather than later!</span></p><div class="pagination">
