        <h1>Chapter 999 Greed-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Ophidian on Lemuria are usually very lustful.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because Gertie and Minerva were extremely beautiful, Kyson immediately set his sights on these two women.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To Kyson, the life or death of the Leah family was irrelevant. If these two women willingly served him, he could spare the Leah family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, his words were an utter humiliation to the Leah family.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>No matter what, the Leah family was a renowned Ancient Martial Art family in the Kinton Mountains.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If they offered the women of their family to others to avoid conflict, how could they stand in the world of Ancient Martial Art on Uswad in the future?</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Trevor said, "You're just at Acquired State Eight. I don't understand why you're so arrogant."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Try the Leah family's Ennead Rotation Celestial Formation first. Even if we can't defeat you, we would never sacrifice the women of our family for safety."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, the other eight Grandmasters unleashed their energy, quickly forming an incredibly intricate Rune, trapping Kyson in the center.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Trevor launched the first attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Using the power of the Ennead Rotation Celestial Formation, he unleashed a frenzied attack on Kyson.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The attack was incredibly powerful, its destructive force overwhelming, instantly engulfing Kyson's body.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Kyson smirked mockingly and threw a punch.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a casual punch, he shattered Trevor's attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Trevor let out a muffled groan, injured by the recoil force within the attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A mouthful of blood surged to his throat, but he swallowed it down.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ennead Rotation Celestial Retribution Punch!" Almost simultaneously, the other two Grandmasters took action, launching an attack on Kyson from both sides.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Their attack, called Ennead Rotation Celestial Retribution Punch, is the strongest move in the Ennead Rotation Celestial Formation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, their combined attack instantly doubled the power unleashed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even an expert at Acquired State Nine might not be able to withstand this attack.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Kyson remained unafraid, casually unleashing another Fist Ray, shattering the Ennead Rotation Celestial Retribution Punch released by the two Grandmasters.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, the power of this punch was clearly even more terrifying than the previous one.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two Grandmasters let out muffled groans, staggered backward, and spat out a mouthful of blood.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This scene instantly left everyone in the Leah family terrified. They never dreamed that even with nine Grandmasters setting up the Ennead Rotation Celestial Formation, Kyson could still win so effortlessly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He even injured three Grandmasters in a row. His strength had completely surpassed everyone's imagination, even leaving Pedro deeply shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, during the fight with Pedro, Kyson hadn't used his full strength.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, Pedro finally realized that the gap between him and Kyson was much greater than he had imagined.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So this is what you call the Ennead Rotation Celestial Formation? If this is all the power it has, it's ridiculously weak," Kyson said mockingly, his expression full of arrogance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The faces of the Grandmasters from the Leah family looked terrible. They instantly realized that Kyson was the strongest opponent they had encountered since creating the Ennead Rotation Celestial Formation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Bastard, don't be so arrogant. I will definitely kill you," Trevor said angrily.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Immediately, he, along with the other eight Grandmasters, unleashed a devastating attack on Kyson.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, the entire sky was filled with the terrifying destructive force they unleashed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kyson was right at the center of the attack. If it were anyone else, they would have been dead by now.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Kyson's expression remained unchanged. Destructive beams of light burst from his body as he directly confronted the combined attack of the nine Grandmasters.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Terrifying rumbling sounds echoed continuously as the destructive force spread in all directions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The strength of the nine Grandmasters was formidable, but it was nothing compared to the destructive beams unleashed by Kyson.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were all sent flying, spitting blood wildly.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This meant the Leah family's proud Ennead Rotation Celestial Formation was effortlessly broken by Kyson.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kyson ignored the nine Grandmasters and turned his gaze to Gertie and Minerva, his expression growing even more greedy.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I said before, if you offered these two women to me, I would spare the Leah family, but you just wouldn't agree.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since that's the case, I'll do it myself," Kyson said smugly. Then, his body rose into the air.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A tremendously powerful destructive force was unleashed. His massive hand suddenly reached toward Gertie's direction, aiming to grab her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, before his massive hand could fall, a tall figure stepped in to shield Gertie.</span></p></div>
