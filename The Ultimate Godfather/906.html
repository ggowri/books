  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man with the ponytail standing before them was Joel's most capable assistant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His name was Haywood Sterling, and he was a fifth-generation cyborg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His capabilities were nearly equivalent to those of an Ancient Martial Stage Eight expert!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joel had gone to such lengths as to dispatch Haywood personally to </span><span>Uswad</span><span> to capture Cecilia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men in black surrounding him were all either cyborgs or metahumans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haywood sneered at Cecilia's words and said, "Ms. McHale, I can't believe you're still so blind to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me be straight with you. Sir McHale is already under Mr. McHale's control, and what's more, the entire McHale Pharmaceuticals Group has practically fallen into Mr. McHale's hands. You're the only piece missing, the future heir to the group. That's why you must return to McHale Pharmaceuticals Group with me today!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa... what have you done to my grandfather?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecilia's face crumpled with worry as she demanded answers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having lost her parents at a young age, Cecilia was raised by her grandfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their close bond had only grown stronger over the years, and she couldn't bear the thought of anything happening to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Ms. McHale. Mr. McHale isn't quite ready to commit patricide yet," Haywood said with a sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as Sir McHale agrees to hand over his position as CEO to Joel at tomorrow's inauguration ceremony, I can assure you no harm will come to him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haywood's cold laugh echoed through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecilia bit her crimson lip, her voice sharp as ice. She said, "Tell my uncle he can have my position as CEO of McHale Pharmaceuticals Group, but only if he guarantees my grandfather's safety."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. McHale doesn't want just your verbal agreement," Haywood scoffed. "He wants you to announce your resignation publicly at his inauguration ceremony!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cecilia's heart turned to ice, but she nodded without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would do anything to ensure Rhett's safety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald has nothing to do with this situation. You need to let him go immediately," Cecilia said, glancing at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haywood let out another cruel laugh. "Since he's been hanging around Ms. McHale, he might as well join us for the trip back to </span><span>Acoton</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haywood, this is strictly McHale Pharmaceuticals Group business. You have no right to drag others into our family affairs!" Cecilia protested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of Marcus getting caught up in her family's mess made her feel guilty. If anything happened to him, it would haunt her forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. McHale, there's nothing more to discuss. These are Mr. McHale's direct orders! Everyone around you must be taken away. I'm simply following his instructions!" Haywood declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hand at his men as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men immediately stepped forward, attempting to apprehend Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A cold glint flashed in Marcus' eyes, but he offered no resistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He allowed them to handcuff him and escort him out of the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Haywood's men loaded Marcus and Cecilia into a luxury executive van.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The vehicle started up and quickly made its way to an airport.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Gulfstream private jet was waiting on the tarmac.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The guards roughly pushed Marcus and Cecilia aboard the aircraft.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Gulfstream quickly took off, setting course for </span><span>Acoton</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although </span><span>Uswad</span><span> and </span><span>Acoton</span><span> were far apart, the Gulfstream's exceptional performance allowed it to cruise at near-sonic speeds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The aircraft touched down at </span><span>Acoton's</span><span> airport in less than eight hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus and Cecilia were immediately transported and imprisoned in a secluded mountain villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The villa was heavily fortified, with cyborgs carrying heavy weapons guarding its perimeter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus and Cecilia were confined in a room sealed by a massive iron door.</span></p><div class="pagination">
