It's only authorized for Golden Group to produce. No matter how much money is offered, my father has no intention of selling this patent. I'm sorry, Ms. Perez. If there's nothing else, this discussion is over."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The executives stood up, ready to leave the conference room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These people from Weston Land were unreasonable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That morning, they had shown up uninvited, demanding to buy the patent for a drug Charles had created.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was the price they offered ridiculous, but they also wanted exclusive production rights, preventing Golden Group from continuing to produce the drug.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne found these terms unacceptable and rejected them outright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the other side wouldn't let it go, constantly flaunting their influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that communication was impossible, Yvonne decided to end the discussion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as they were about to leave, two Westoners next to Luna stood up and blocked Yvonne's path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You ungrateful bitch," Albert spat, "It's an honor for Ms. Perez to even talk to you, understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night before, after Marcus left, Albert had begged Luna not to leave him, managing to salvage their relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, Luna was representing McHale Pharmaceuticals Group to discuss buying the medical patent from Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert was eager to impress.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With McHale Pharmaceuticals Group backing him, he felt even more reckless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The patent is mine, and whether I sell it or not is my decision. What do you mean by this?" Yvonne shot back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't believe how arrogant these people from Acoton were, using their status to bully others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Yvonne could finish, Albert slapped her hard across the face, leaving a clear hand print and a swollen cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bitch." Albert threatened. "If you don't sell this patent, we can shut down your company in minutes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus arrived at Golden Group's Pharmaceutical Industrial Park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he was about to enter the CEO's office, he heard the argument coming from the conference room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert's arrogant voice infuriated him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus tried to push open the conference room door, but it seemed to be locked from the inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With one kick, he broke down the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two men behind the door were knocked to the ground and cried out in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden commotion shocked everyone in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes turned to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne and the others from Golden Group were relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna and Albert, on the other hand, were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, how can it be you?" Albert muttered, rubbing his eyes in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The day before, at Jade's birthday party, he had clashed with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had to apologize to Marcus to avoid punishment from Cecilia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never expected to see Marcus again, especially under such circumstances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you trying to force them to hand over the patent?" Marcus demanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced coldly at Luna and Albert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna and Albert exchanged a glance. Albert said, "We're not forcing anyone. We offered a high price, but they didn't appreciate it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" Marcus snapped, "They have made it clear they don't want to sell the patent, yet you keep pushing. If that's not forcing, what is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert snorted, "Even if it is, what does it have to do with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smirked. "This place is mine. So, what do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luna and Albert were both shocked. They never imagined Marcus was the owner of Pharmaceutical Industrial Park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you alright?" Marcus asked Yvonne, looking at her swollen cheek. His anger grew even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah," Yvonne replied. "These people are from McHale Pharmaceuticals Group in Acoton, one of the top three medical companies in the world. We should avoid offending them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave Yvonne a reassuring look and turned to Albert. "Did you hit her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Albert's face paled, and sweat beaded on his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, it was me," he admitted.</span></p><div class="pagination">
