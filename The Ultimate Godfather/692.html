  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The face of the Bloodthirsty Cult leader changed. He said with anger, "Boy, I'm talking to you because you've cultivated yourself at such a young age that it would be a pity to die. I'm not afraid of you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you're so ungrateful, go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, an evil aura surged from the Bloodthirsty Cult leader, instantly enshrouding his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a step forward, the shadow of a massive bat abruptly materialized behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bat let out shrill screeches and pounced towards Marcus, accompanying the attack of the Bloodthirsty Cult leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, showed no signs of fear. He also took a step forward, fully unleashing the aura of an expert at the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Timeless Warrior's Grimoire also reached its pinnacle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without any elaborate moves, Marcus directly launched a terrifying Fist Ray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fists had power beyond imagination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Fist Ray collided with the attack of the Bloodthirsty Cult leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Accompanied by a deafening explosion, the Bloodthirsty Cult leader merely felt his wrist tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An irresistible force drove him backward frantically.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never anticipated that although they were at the same level, Marcus' attack was so powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could react, Marcus took another step forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying Fist Ray seemed to penetrate everything, hurtling toward the Bloodthirsty Cult leader's body with destructive force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bloodthirsty Cult leader desperately attempted to launch an attack to resist, but his chest was suddenly jolted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He almost vomited blood, but he held it back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boy, you've forced my hand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing he was at a disadvantage, the Bloodthirsty Cult leader held an amulet in his hand and quickly crushed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A terrifying and bloodthirsty aura suddenly emanated from the amulet, rapidly enveloping the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately thereafter, a blood-red light shone around him, and the aura within his body surged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, he seemed to release a power beyond his realm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right after that, an extremely potent Devouring Power burst forth from his body and swiftly enshrouded Marcus' body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blood Curse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Accompanied by a roar from the Bloodthirsty Cult leader, the Devouring Power suddenly surged, attempting to devour the energy within Marcus' body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He can also wield devouring power."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He discerned that the opponent's devouring power stemmed from the amulet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the spell on the amulet, some malevolent power within the leader's body was stimulated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although both were of the same type of devouring power, the Bloodthirsty Cult leader's power was far less advanced than Marcus'.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did it consume amulets, but it also inflicted irreversible damage upon himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, the energy couldn't bring any benefits to the Bloodthirsty Cult leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the most significant difference from Marcus' devouring power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boy, my ultimate move will send you to the hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bloodthirsty Cult leader laughed with great pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He believed Marcus was surely doomed to be slain after he unleashed the power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't actually think your devouring power is that formidable, do you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, under the disbelieving gaze of the Bloodthirsty Cult leader, a terrifying Devouring Power also radiated from Marcus' body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This devouring power instantaneously suppressed the Bloodthirsty Cult leader's devouring power and enveloped his body quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader of the Bloodthirsty Cult couldn't believe Marcus had power similar to his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Marcus' power was greater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The leader of Bloodthirsty Cult tried to break free immediately, but he couldn't manage it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' devouring power was too potent and directly bound the Bloodthirsty Cult leader's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bloodthirsty Cult leader felt the energy within his body dissipating rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He desperately attempted to release his power to halt the energy loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was of no avail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As time elapsed, the devouring power released by Marcus grew stronger and stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bloodthirsty Cult leader could feel his energy draining away rapidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He trembled violently. His face was pale, and his eyes were brimming with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, his pair of red pupils gradually dimmed, and his body ceased struggling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Bloodthirsty Cult leader collapsed feebly onto the ground. His skin and flesh gradually shriveled up. And finally, he became a mummy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Till his death, the Bloodthirsty Cult leader stared at Marcus with great resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Witnessing this scene, the women shrieked with horror.</span></p><div class="pagination">
