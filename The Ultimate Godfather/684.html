  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just before those black bugs could reach Ada, a fearsome flame abruptly plummeted from the void, like a downpour of fire from the sky, engulfing the bugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the very next instant, a series of intense crackling and burning sounds filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bugs emitted squeaking noises and made frantic attempts to flee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nevertheless, the power of the flame was overwhelming. It spread far and wide, and in no time, thousands of the black bugs were swiftly reduced to ashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada narrowed her beautiful eyes and then realized that it was Marcus who had come to her rescue!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three guardians of the Bloodthirsty Cult all glared at Marcus, their bloodshot eyes growing fierce, and asked, "Who are you? How dare you interfere in the affairs of the Bloodthirsty Cult? Are you seeking death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result of Marcus' penchant for concealing the true extent of his cultivation realm, from the perspective of others, he appeared to be merely at the Ancient Martial Stage Three or Four, hardly resembling an expert in the least.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I usually don't bother to meddle in the affairs of other sects, but when it comes to the Bloodthirsty Cult, I can't stand by and do nothing," Marcus sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada cast a deep glance at Marcus, never expecting that he would protect her at such a critical moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, there was nothing between them other than a one-night stand.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at present, they were up against the three guardians of the Bloodthirsty Cult, each of whom was incredibly formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada's severe injuries prevented her from helping Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His decision to step forward was, without a doubt, a choice fraught with great peril.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you deaf? We've told you that the three of us are the three guardians of the Bloodthirsty Cult. How dare you get involved? You are really seeking death," one of the three guardians of the Bloodthirsty Cult snorted, gazing at Marcus with contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Among them, the person with the lowest cultivation level was a Level Seven Curse Weaver. Such strength was on par with that of a patriarch in the world of Ancient Martial Art in Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus hadn't undergone samsara. In fact, he was merely in his early twenties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From their perspective, his interference at that particular moment was tantamount to suicide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think that this guy must have been attracted by the beauty of this bitch and attempted to play the hero," another guardian from the Bloodthirsty Cult teased playfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He really overestimates himself. It seems that we really can't kill him," the Curse Weaver, at the peak of Level Seven, sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Curse Weaver beside him asked, "Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because I want him to witness with his own eyes how we play with this bitch and how my penis inserts into her vagina. That kind of visual impact must be amazing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Curse Weaver, at the peak of Level Seven, couldn't help but let out an obscene laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared lustfully at Ada, who was known as the most beautiful woman in the world of Ancient Martial Art in Uswad. Killing her immediately would be a waste. Perhaps having sex with her before taking her life was a more appealing option.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she listened to their conversation, her face darkened even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a simple stretch of her hand, a milky-white sword abruptly materialized in her palm. She was ready to fight to the death against them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll deal with them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before Ada could make a move, Marcus stopped her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She reminded him, "Their strength is extraordinary. Be careful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite knowing that he was extremely powerful, she couldn't suppress her concerns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When confronted with the three guardians, Ada was only capable of self-defense and had no ability to launch a counter-attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had it not been for the numerous life-saving magical artifacts from the Celestial Arc Order stored in her Spatial Ring, she most likely would have perished long before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was enough to show how formidable the three guardians were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Regardless of how powerful Marcus was, he might not be able to withstand them when fighting alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave Ada a reassuring look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes fell on the three guardians of the Bloodthirsty Cult, and he asked, "Do you prefer to meet your end one at a time or simultaneously?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their view, Marcus' words were extremely presumptuous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the guardians let out a scornful laugh. "This guy has clearly lost his wits! How could he dare to challenge us with his measly strength? I'll take his life right away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, blood-red light erupted from him, condensing into a highly terrifying blood handprint. Then, he lashed out at Marcus with it in a frenzy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood handprint was imbued with a Blood Curse of the Bloodthirsty Cult, causing its power to multiply instantaneously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a Level Seven Curse Weaver, so ordinary warriors at the Ancient Martial Stage Seven would find it difficult to resist him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus had already advanced to the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Eight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with such a blood handprint, he showed no sign of fear whatsoever and casually threw a punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, a dreadful explosion resounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the two attacks made contact, the guardian's blood handprint abruptly disintegrated into dust.</span></p><div class="pagination">
