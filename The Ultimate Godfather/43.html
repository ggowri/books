  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine rushed forward, her eyes filled with a mix of hope and anxiety. "Mr. Miller, was the operation successful? How is my mother?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles looked grim as he shook his head. "The patient's cancer cells are entangled with dense blood vessels. I caused heavy bleeding as soon as I made the incision. The surgery failed. Prepare for the worst."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words hit Catherine like a physical blow. Her knees buckled, and she nearly collapsed on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Miller, you're a master of your craft. Please, save my mom. I can't live without her..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears streamed down her face as she begged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles sighed, shaking his head. "I'm sorry, there's nothing more I can do. The patient is dying."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a young nurse who had earlier laughed at Marcus froze, her eyes wide with shock. "Hemorrhage! It's exactly as he predicted. It's 2:30 p.m., just like he said. He foresaw everything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pointed at Marcus with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent for a moment before the realization spread through the crowd like wildfire. Everyone's gaze shifted to Marcus, their expressions shifting from skepticism to something more akin to awe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas looked livid, though even he couldn't deny the chill running down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But pride and jealousy kept him from admitting Marcus might have real skill. "What's all the fuss about?" Thomas barked. "Even if he guessed right, so what? He's just an ordinary guy. It's a blind squirrel finding a nut! Doesn't prove anything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few of the younger nurses seemed to buy into Thomas's reasoning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Marcus didn't look like anyone special. There was no way someone like him could understand medicine, let alone predict something so specific.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had to be a coincidence, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Prepare a blood bag and a hemostatic potion for me. Now. There's still time to save her," Marcus said, his focus entirely on saving Laura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles yelled at Marcus, "What do you want? I admit, I lost the bet. I'll take responsibility for the patient's medical expenses. But this is hospital. I won't allow you to interfere!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shot him a cold smile, "You're a doctor, yet you can't save Mrs. Wilson. And you won't let someone else try?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles found himself at a loss for words, unable to muster any retort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas stepped forward. "You think you can cure her? You're just a madman. How ridiculous! Sure, I respect Mr. Miller, and yes, the surgery failed. But that's within the realm of probability. Security! Get this lunatic out of here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the tension spiked, several security guards surged forward, ready to spring into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before they could move, Charles waved them off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let him try. If things go south, we'll throw him out ourselves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze brimmed with derision as he thought, "Let's see what brilliant plan this whippersnapper in his early twenties can conjure up to save a patient ravaged by the late stages of cancer, now hemorrhaging after surgery gone wrong."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Prepare the hemostatic potion. Now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't miss a beat; he strode briskly into the operating room with a determined pace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas hesitated but begrudgingly nodded at the nurse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We can get the drugs, but the patient's blood type is rare. Good luck getting enough from the blood bank in time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his sarcasm couldn't be contained. He didn't want to waste another second of his life on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have the same blood type as my mother. Use mine!" Catherine declared, rushing after the nurse to donate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within ten minutes, fresh blood and the necessary drugs were ready.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked at everyone, declaring, "My procedure can't be interrupted. Everyone, step outside. Mrs. Wilson will wake up in thirty minutes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles and Thomas exchanged a glance, both seeing the skepticism in each other's eyes. They were certain Marcus was about to make a fool of himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gazing at her mother, whose life was ebbing away on the stark white sheets of the hospital bed, Catherine felt helpless. Her eyes held no flicker of hope for Marcus's efforts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this heart-wrenching instant, her only recourse was to place her fragile trust in Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the doors to the operating room closed, Marcus sprang into action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With deft precision, he first administered hemostatic agents into Laura's veins. Then, with equal care, he initiated the blood transfusion, striving to stabilize her faltering vital signs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he retrieved a miraculous herb, one known for its healing properties, from the Spatial Ring. He meticulously ground it into a fine powder before gently administering it to Laura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simultaneously, he started to channel the Numinous Energy from the palm of his hand directly into Laura's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Numinous Energy intertwined with the potent essence of the spiritual herbs. Together, they initiated a delicate dance of healing within her, tenderly mending the tissues ravaged by the unsuccessful surgery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the synergistic magic of the Numinous Energy and the enchantment of the mystical herbs, Laura's damaged tissues began to knit themselves back together with astonishing speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than ten minutes, the internal bleeding had stopped completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus then sutured the wounds, following the methods recorded in Timeless Warrior's Grimoire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, he focused on eradicating the cancer cells.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty minutes later, the last of the malignant cells was gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Laura remained unconscious, her weathered face, once ashen, now hinted at a soft blush of life. Her breathing, previously ragged, settled into a steady rhythm, whispering promises of recovery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She seemed to be resting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus exhaled slowly, wiping the sweat from his brow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was his first time treating a patient, and while he'd been confident, the reality of the success was overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only had he mastered Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, but he'd also unlocked the miraculous healing techniques contained within.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments ago, he meticulously stitched up Laura's wound. Despite never having performed such a task before, his hands moved with a precision that would put even seasoned doctors to shame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's been almost thirty minutes, and I guarantee he's done nothing but make things worse. The guy's a joke."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the operating room, the mood was tense. Thomas scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles didn't say anything, but his expression was one of contempt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The commotion was like a magnet, drawing a crowd; people drifted over, eager to catch a glimpse of the spectacle unfolding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the news broke that someone had the miraculous ability to save a patient teetering on the brink of death from a catastrophic hemorrhage post a botched cancer surgery, all within the span of thirty minutes, a wave of skepticism washed over them. Their faces were etched with doubt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the doors to the operating room swung open. Marcus emerged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So, you failed? If you did, get out of here before I call the guards to drag you out." Thomas jeered.</span></p><div class="pagination">
