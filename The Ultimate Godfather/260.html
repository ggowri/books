        <h1>Chapter 259 Mysterious Zone</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Marcus wrapped a towel around Pearl's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pearl's beautiful eyes sparkled with disappointment. "Am I ugly, sir? Don't you like me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she said this, tears began to well up in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, you are very beautiful." Marcus shook his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why don't you want me? I am still a virgin," Pearl continued to press. Her father had given her a strict order to offer herself to Marcus. Pearl dared not disobey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is our first meeting. You don't have to do this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Marcus enjoyed beauty, he did not like to obtain it through coercion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could see that Pearl was forced into this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus did not want to force others to sacrifice themselves for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>But,</span><span> this is my father's command," Pearl said with some worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cooke was the king of the entire Red River Mines. His commands were obeyed by all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even as Cooke's daughter, Pearl had an innate fear of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tell Cooke that this is my idea. If he dares to trouble you, let him come and see me," Marcus said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pearl looked deeply at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way here, Pearl had thought that the man her father wanted her to serve would be an old man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she did not expect Marcus not only to be handsome but also different from other men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The men in the Red River Mines were all covetous of her beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she agreed, those men would surely rush at her like hungry wolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, Marcus had refused her offer of herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Pearl grateful but also made her doubt her own beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Marcus had refused so resolutely, Pearl had no choice but to leave the cabin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had not expected Cooke to take such a step, sacrificing his own daughter to show his loyalty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this action made Marcus feel somewhat disgusted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, he did not rest but continued to practice Shadow Step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the next morning, Marcus could already take more than ten steps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And these simple steps were enough to deal with most opponents' attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, once Marcus advanced to the next level, his speed would increase by more </span><span>than 20%.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, before Marcus even woke up, Pearl came to attend to his needs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she was Cooke's daughter, Pearl worked efficiently, unlike a pampered young lady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus did not refuse Pearl's service. After breakfast, he got into Cooke's off-road vehicle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mountain road was rugged and muddy, and only special off-road vehicles could barely pass through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They drove through the rainforest for several hours and finally arrived at the foot of a mountain range.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of the mountain range was a cliff as if cut by a knife, reaching up to the sky, with clouds and mist above, giving a mysterious and ethereal feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, we have arrived," Cooke said to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus released his consciousness, enveloping the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He found that an invisible force confined this area, and nothing from the outside could penetrate it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus guessed that a powerful array master must have set up a shielding array here, blocking all contact between this area and the outside world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, two elders emerged from the dense forest nearby. Judging from their aura, they were also warriors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They scrutinized Marcus and Cooke with serious gazes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gentlemen, we wish to enter the Southern Market. Please allow us," Cooke said, taking off his hat in a bow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I remember you came to the Southern Market more than ten years ago. You should know the rules here. Those below Ancient Martial Stage Two are not allowed to enter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You brought another youngster here this time. Are you mocking us?" One of the elders said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could see that Cooke's cultivation had not improved in over a decade, still at Stage One. The reason he had allowed Cooke to enter the Southern Market back then was because Cooke's companion was a powerful figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave, or don't blame us for being rough," the other elder said coldly, paying no attention to Marcus beside Cooke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Marcus looked to be in his early twenties, the elders assumed he was Cooke's subordinate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as soon as the words left the elders' mouths, Marcus released his aura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A supreme pressure descended from the sky, pressing down on the two elders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elders' expressions changed drastically, and their backs were bent under the pressure.</span></p></div>
