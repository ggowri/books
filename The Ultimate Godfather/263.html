        <h1>Chapter 262 Truman Dupont</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus and Cooke kept watching&nbsp;the gambling scene at Grand Fortune for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus found that, apart from some onlookers, most gamblers, unless they had certain professional knowledge, usually hired an experienced master.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These masters were mainly responsible for selecting raw materials for the players.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the help of these masters, they have a higher chance to pick a good one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the fees for hiring experienced masters were indeed quite high.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hiring the top masters in the Southern Market for a day could cost over ten billion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Marcus thought such pricing was outrageous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the ordinary world, one&nbsp;could buy a listed company&nbsp;with that money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet in the Southern Market, exclusive to warriors, it could only hire these top </span><span>gambling masters for a day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even at such high prices, these masters still considered the identity of the hirer before deciding whether to take the job.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were only a few such top masters in the entire Southern Market, and they were always in high demand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus and Cooke had been there for a short while when someone opened a raw material that could shock the entire Southern Market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crystal produced from this stone was not only massive but also of very high grade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just this single crystal was worth over 50 billion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After deducting the 10 billion for hiring the master, the person netted 40 billion in just half an hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made many people present envious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such incidents happened frequently in the Southern Market, which was the real reason why these gambling masters were in such high demand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, do you want to try your luck? But gambling on stones is risky. We can start with some cheaper materials to test our luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or we can hire a gambling master. That way, we'll have a better chance," Cooke said to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's wait a bit longer." Marcus wasn't in a hurry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire in his body quietly activated, and his X-ray vision opened, continuously searching for good materials.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the exploration of X-ray vision, all the stones on the site became transparent, and Marcus could easily see the internal structure of the stones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the gambling masters couldn't compete with his ability.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, that's Truman Dupont from the Astral Serpent Order. He's actually here at Grand Fortune, and he's hired Giles&nbsp;Hansen. It seems he's going to gamble big today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that&nbsp;moment, a shout came from the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people turned to look towards the entrance of Grand Fortune, where a young man in a white suit and with an extraordinary demeanor walked in first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind him were several attendants, and next to him was an old man with white hair and beard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man was Truman Dupont, the son of the grand elder of the Astral Serpent Order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As one of the three major martial arts sects in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, the Astral Serpent Order held a supreme position in the martial arts world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The grand elder of the Astral Serpent Order was the most influential person after the sect leader.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His son, Truman, was highly regarded. Wherever Truman went, he was the focus of everyone's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Truman had just turned 25 this year, and his cultivation had reached the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Three, just one step away from Stage Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His talent was among the best in the younger generation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Giles he hired was also the most famous gambling master in the Southern Market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Giles' professional selection, the success rate of gambling could reach over 80%.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, many people were willing to spend a lot of money to hire Giles, though ordinary people had no chance to even meet someone like Giles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Truman arrive, the manager of Grand Fortune personally came forward to greet him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Truman was in high spirits as he said to the crowd, "Everyone, please ignore me. Enjoy yourselves. I'm just here to have some fun today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, Camila and Jennifer also arrived at Grand Fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Camy, Mr. Dupont is over there. Let's go and take a look," Jennifer said with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had heard that Truman was at Grand Fortune and had followed him here to catch a glimpse of this young prodigy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus also noticed Truman, but he didn't pay much attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was currently selecting raw materials in the largest stone area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Truman and Giles also came to this area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Marcus was selecting, they waited nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, Marcus locked onto a raw material that was uneven and bumpy, about the size of a watermelon, and looked very unremarkable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to its&nbsp;appearance, this raw material was one of the few with extremely poor quality in the entire venue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus skipped over the raw materials that looked good and pointed to the one he had chosen, asking, "How much is this stone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone looked puzzled and stared at Marcus as if looking at a&nbsp;fool.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Camila and Jennifer, who followed along, were full of ridicule.</span></p></div>
