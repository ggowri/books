  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They were preparing to corner him in one of the areas he frequented. Ewan, along with Quinton&mdash;the young man who had introduced him to the Axe Gang&mdash;were naturally there as well. At that moment, Marcus was just about to drive his Aston Martin to Solomia Hospital to visit Kiera.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But as he drove out of Bayside Villa, several black SUVs pulled up, blocking his way. Marcus furrowed his brow and brought his car to a stop at the side of the road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dozens of figures emerged from the black vehicles. Among them were members of the Axe Gang, as well as Ewan and Quinton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus, what are you waiting for? Get out of the car and face your death!" Ewan shouted arrogantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The anger from the slap Marcus had given him the day before had simmered through the night, and now, with the Axe Gang backing him up, Ewan was eager to make Marcus pay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon seeing Ewan and Quinton, Marcus realized what was going on. He calmly got out of the car, his expression unbothered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Didn't expect this, did you?" Ewan sneered. "Just a day after you acted so high and mighty, and now you're going to pay the price for it. Aren't you regretting it yet?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow, his tone cool. "Regret? Why would I?" He couldn't understand what kind of confidence Ewan had, but hearing him speak like that almost made Marcus want to laugh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll admit, you're good with your fists, but this is Kingston. These guys are Axe Gang," Ewan said with a smirk. "You didn't just hit me&mdash;you also tried to steal my girl. You really think I'm going to let you walk away from here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' eyes scanned the group behind Ewan. Only then did it hit him&mdash;they'd brought in the underground heavyweights to deal with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But there was something about the man leading the Axe Gang that seemed unfamiliar. He'd never seen him before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Axe Gang leader's name was Hayden. He was a newly promoted boss within the gang. When Marcus had visited the Axe Gang headquarters to take it over, Hayden hadn't been there. That's why Hayden didn't recognize him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's right," Ewan continued. "This is Hayden, the new boss of Kingston's Axe Gang. If you don't want to die today, you'd better kneel and apologize, and then cut off the hand you slapped me with. Stay away from Shannon, and I'll let you go. Otherwise, no matter how tough you are, in front of Axe Gang, you're a dead man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Marcus could respond, Hayden and his men subtly revealed their weapons&mdash;bulges from concealed firearms poking from their waistbands, a clear warning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Wait a minute," Marcus said, still calm. "You're the boss of Axe Gang? Why have I never heard of you before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hayden's eyes narrowed, a sneer curling his lips. "Who the hell are you to ask? A nobody from Solomia. You think you have the right to know me? Kingston's Axe Gang is one of the top five underground organizations in the city. You think your little Solomia gangs even compare to us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hayden took a moment to bask in his pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At just 28, he had climbed the ranks to become the boss of one of Kingston's most powerful gangs. It was a rare achievement that made him feel untouchable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You must be the new boss," Marcus remarked, breaking Hayden's moment of triumph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hayden's grin faltered for a second. "So what if I'm new? You heard my man Ewan. Kneel, apologize, and cut off your hand. Otherwise, when we get our hands on you, you'll wish you were never born."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus smiled and replied, "You know, I'm pretty familiar with the rules of Axe Gang. And you, just promoted to boss, already breaking protocol by taking jobs in Solomia without permission. Do you think your boss would approve of that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hayden's face tightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He hadn't expected Marcus to know about their gang's internal rules.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This job was supposed to be a personal one, not an official mission for the gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He'd hoped no one would find out, but now, the moment Marcus mentioned it, the tension in the air grew thick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Trying to mask his discomfort, Hayden scoffed, "What's it to you? Just stay out of it. You're making it sound like you actually know our boss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The rest of Hayden's crew laughed derisively, their eyes full of mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How could a small-town guy from Solomia possibly know their boss?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Well, funny thing," Marcus said, his smile widening. "I do know your boss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he pulled out his phone and dialed the Axe Gang leader's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He briefly explained the situation, then hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As soon as the phone clicked off, Hayden and his crew burst into laughter, mocking Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They didn't believe for a second that Marcus really knew their boss. They thought it was all an elaborate joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Ewan and Quinton joined in, their laughter dripping with scorn. But Marcus' expression remained unchanged as he waited, his calm demeanor a stark contrast to the growing tension.</span></p><div class="pagination">
