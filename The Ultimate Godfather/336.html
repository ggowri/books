And you think you can kill me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaun sneered, "I might not be a match for you, but Mr. Hudson has brought his 4th-generation cyborgs. No matter how strong you are, there's no way you can handle eight of them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaun's impression of Marcus was still stuck on the events of Matthew's 80th birthday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, Marcus was only at the Ancient Martial Stage Three, far from being a match for these advanced cyborgs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus' progress had been astonishingly rapid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than a month, he had advanced from Ancient Martial Stage Three to the peak of the Ancient Martial Stage Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had also mastered lethal techniques such as the Devouring Power and Shadow Step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His strength had more than doubled, and dealing with these half-human, half-machine monstrosities was no longer a challenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Whitman, don't waste time on him. Watch how I slay him," Aiton said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He issued a command to the cyborgs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The eight cyborgs let out a unified roar and charged toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine immediately drew her pistol and fired at the two leading cyborgs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gunfire rang out in rapid succession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shockingly, the cyborgs didn't dodge or flinch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They marched forward step by step, the bullets ricocheting harmlessly off their bodies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine was shocked. She had never imagined that these so-called cyborgs could be immune to bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, what should we do?" Maxine asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't sure if Marcus could handle these monsters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Step aside. I'll take care of them," Marcus replied, gesturing for her to retreat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Maxine moved to a safe distance, Marcus retrieved a compact submachine gun from his storage ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weapon was embedded with a blue energy crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It radiated a powerful energy wave that filled the place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This gun had been modified by Diana, and it was the best among the weapons she had provided.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus carried it wherever he went.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today was the perfect opportunity to test its power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, these monsters are immune to ordinary weapons. Your gun won't work," Maxine shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was worried he might underestimate the enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just watch," Marcus said, giving her a reassuring glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of the cyborgs lunged toward him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Enhanced by 4th-generation mechanical augmentations, its punch carried the force of ten thousand pounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before the cyborg's fist could land, Marcus pulled the trigger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A beam of destructive light shot out from the submachine gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It contained terrifying destructive force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The light beam struck the cyborg, sending it crashing to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The explosive energy blasted a bowl-sized crater into its chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its internal machinery was exposed and began to smoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Marcus fired again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another beam pierced the cyborg's chest, destroying its mechanical core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In seconds, flames erupted, engulfing the cyborg's body. Within moments, it was reduced to a charred husk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Shaun and Aiton were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of gun is that? How can it be so powerful?" Aiton muttered in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His 4th-generation cyborgs were as strong as practitioners at Ancient Martial Stage Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Together, they were comparable to an expert at the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That level of strength was more than enough to kill Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he hadn't expected Marcus to wield such a devastating weapon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gun was clearly of Acoton origin. It was one of their latest submachine gun models.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, it didn't fire bullets but beams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not qualified to know," Marcus laughed, pulling the trigger again and targeting the second cyborg.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to the high-grade energy crystal embedded in the weapon, its power was unmatched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each shot carried the strength of an expert at Ancient Martial Stage Three. Even the advanced defenses of these cyborgs couldn't withstand the relentless barrage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Explosions echoed continuously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cyborgs were hit and struck down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than two minutes, all eight cyborgs were reduced to scrap metal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine was astounded by the scene.</span></p><div class="pagination">
