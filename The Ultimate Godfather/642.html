  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if knowing they were about to have sex, Yvonne locked the door behind her as she entered the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said, "Let's sit on the couch. I'll take a look at your face."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne nodded softly, and the two of them settled down on the couch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she sat there, a memory flashed through her mind, a memory of two weeks ago when she and Marcus had shared a passionate moment on this very couch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face flushed at the thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, completely unaware of what was running through Yvonne's mind, focused intently on her swollen face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze was so concentrated that Yvonne found herself lost in it for a moment, mesmerized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on. I'll help you with the swelling."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a subtle gesture, he activated Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, and Timeless Numinous Energy began to swirl around him, gathering in his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He carefully directed it toward Yvonne's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the energy touched her skin, Yvonne was overwhelmed by a strange, tingling warmth, a sensation unlike anything she had ever felt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the energy was focused on her face, it quickly spread through her entire body, flowing down her meridians and finally gathering at her lower abdomen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Directly beneath it was the most sensitive part of her body, the area that sent waves of heat through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The powerful flow of energy caused her to react almost immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her cheeks turned even redder. Her breath quickened, and a soft, helpless moan escaped her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her flushed, breathless expression made something stir in Marcus' chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had missed this girl deeply, and the attraction he felt for her was undeniable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne let out a low, breathy sigh.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to him, her voice trembling slightly. "Marcus... Why do I feel like this? I'm so hot all over... I feel like I can't take it anymore. How long is this going to last?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Yvonne's legs, encased in black stockings, started to rub together almost instinctively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each touch sent waves of sensation, teasing the most sensitive spots and sparking an overwhelming rush of pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sharp, breathless cry escaped Yvonne's lips, her body trembling with the intensity of the sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment of contact, she was thrust into a peak of pleasure, her body jolting as if struck by electricity, her mind going completely blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, why are you so bad? You're making me feel so uncomfortable..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne's voice quivered slightly, her lips parted as if she were floating in a dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Yvonne had slept with Marcus more than once, revealing such a vulnerable side of herself still left her feeling deeply embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm just treating you. What's wrong with that?" Marcus chuckled, his gaze lingering on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From where he sat, he had an unobstructed view of the neckline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The deep curve was mesmerizing, and the skin flushed with a soft redness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unable to suppress himself, Marcus slid his hand into her collar and squeezed her full breasts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne glared at Marcus, but her gaze held a hint of undeniable charm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to Marcus' Timeless Numinous Energy treatment, the swelling on her cheek had disappeared completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It looked as though nothing had ever happened, and the pain was now a distant memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that charged moment, Marcus couldn't hold back any longer. He leaned in and softly kissed Yvonne on the lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne, caught off guard, found herself instinctively returning the kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She squeezed her eyes shut, her mind overwhelmed by the vivid memories of the fiery moments she had experienced with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She got wetter, thoroughly soaking the black lace panties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus flipped over and pressed Yvonne beneath him, his lips claiming hers with fiery intensity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you miss me?" he whispered, his voice low and teasing as he kissed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne, struggling to catch her breath, answered with a soft sigh, "I've missed you... every single day. But you hardly ever come to see me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had taken off Yvonne's shirt to reveal the black lace bra.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand traced along the bra and teased her firm tits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne's body jolted, her mind going completely blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could react, Yvonne felt Marcus' hand claim her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With every lingering touch, a deep, aching emptiness surged within her, a desperate yearning to be consumed by something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Feeling a tight, electrifying pull, Marcus tore off her bra and took off his shirt, thrusting in her slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne let out a satisfied cry, her body overwhelmed by a sudden fullness, taking her to the peak of pleasure once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strong tightness wrapped around him, making Marcus instinctively quicken his movements.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As their bodies rubbed together, Yvonne felt a rush of joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She moaned uncontrollably, breathless as she gasped.</span></p><div class="pagination">
