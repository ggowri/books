        <h1>Chapter 737 Stop Torturing Me</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus suddenly barged in, Lucy screamed and instinctively reached for the blanket to cover herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her body felt weak, and her eyes quickly grew hazy again. She writhed on the bed, her hands roaming over her body, eventually caressing her chest and moving lower, rubbing between her thighs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each movement made Lucy moan loudly, her voice high-pitched and seductive. Seeing this, Marcus immediately realized that Zachary must have drugged Lucy with some kind of aphrodisiac.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of lackey are you? How dare you barge into my room like this?" Zachary scowled, his expression still arrogant, like someone who was used to being in control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, Marcus seemed like just another thug working for one of his subordinates&mdash;completely disrespectful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You already tried to have me killed. Are you really going to pretend you've forgotten about that?" Marcus sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary's face changed, his eyes widening in disbelief. "You... You're Marcus?" His posture became more guarded as he instinctively stepped back. "Are you human or a ghost? How did you get in here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary had gone to great lengths to get revenge for his grandson, Ross, even hiring two elders from the Swords Sect, both masters in ancient martial arts. He was confident the plan was foolproof.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, seeing Marcus in front of him, Zachary wondered for a moment if Marcus was a ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm human. But the people you hired? They're all dead," Marcus said mockingly, slowly advancing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary's face turned pale, and he kept retreating. "Don't come any closer. If you do, I'll have someone kill you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Marcus had come for revenge, and just the thought of Marcus surviving the assassination attempt from the Swords Sect filled him with dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I killed the Swords Sect members. Do you think your men stand a chance against me?" Marcus said, his voice dripping with disdain, as he cornered Zachary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary's face was full of fear, and he hastily tried to bargain. "Don't kill me. I'll give you anything you want. How about this beauty on the bed? I haven't even had the chance to enjoy her yet. If you spare me, I'll give her to you. I can also give you all the money you want... Just spare my life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being in his late </span><span>eighties</span><span>, Zachary was still desperate to hold onto life. Faced with death, he was willing to offer anything in exchange for survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus just smiled coldly, "The moment you decided to kill me, you were already on my death list. And once you're on my list, there's no getting off. So today, you must die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary's face went pale as he realized: either Marcus would die or it would be him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a ruthless figure behind Royal Entertainment, Zachary was no stranger to violence. His hand quickly shot to the drawer, pulling out a gun in a last-ditch attempt to defend himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in front of Marcus, his movements were slow, almost comical. With a swift motion, Marcus grabbed Zachary's wrist and took the gun from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Zachary could even react, Marcus shot him in the left arm. Blood poured out. Zachary let out a scream, his terror intensifying. "Don't... Don't kill me!" Zachary pleaded, his voice shaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shot again, hitting Zachary's right arm. The pain was excruciating, and Zachary nearly passed out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you doing this? Aren't you afraid my family will seek revenge?" Zachary </span><span>hissed,</span><span> his voice full of hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus ignored him, firing two more shots that crippled Zachary's legs. Zachary crumpled to the ground, blood pooling beneath him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was ashen as he stared at his broken limbs, the fear of death creeping into his heart. "Please... stop torturing me. Just end it quickly," Zachary begged, gritting his teeth. He knew by now that Marcus had no intention of sparing him, no matter how much he begged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll do as you wish," Marcus said coldly. Without hesitation, he pulled the trigger again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A single shot rang out, and the bullet pierced Zachary's forehead. Zachary's body went stiff, his eyes wide open in shock, and then he collapsed, dead before he hit the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't want to kill, but Zachary had sent assassins after him. The fact that he had hired two elders from the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Six to kill him showed just how much he had invested in this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus hadn't grown so quickly in strength, anyone else would have already been dead by now. For those who tried to kill him, Marcus showed no mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dealing with Zachary, Marcus turned to leave, but just then, a seductive moan echoed from the bed. He looked back to see Lucy, her face flushed, her eyes glazed with lust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hands moved over her body, her legs wide apart, revealing everything. Her fingers were deeply inside herself, moving in and out with an intensity that made wet sounds. The movement caused a warm, slick wetness to spread, soaking the sheets around her and filling the air with a soft, distinctly feminine aroma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes half-closed, she moaned, "Help me, please. I can't take it anymore. Marcus, I want you. Please take me. I'm so empty."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with Zachary dead, Lucy was still deep in her lust, completely unaware of the danger around her. The strength of the aphrodisiac he had given her was mind-boggling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucy's gaze had grown even more distant and dreamy since Marcus had arrived. She was completely lost in her own world, her body moving with a sense of unbridled curiosity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her legs were parted, baring a tantalizing glimpse of what lay between them. Her fingers danced in and out, creating soft, intimate sounds that made the air seem charged with a kind of forbidden thrill. It was a look that could captivate any man, a sight so enticing it was almost too much to bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus frowned, then used his X-ray vision to see what was happening inside her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He saw the pink-colored drug coursing through her blood, reaching every cell. Its effects were far stronger than anything available on the market, and the dosage was massive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Lucy couldn't find release soon, her blood vessels would burst, and she would die within the hour.</span></p></div>
