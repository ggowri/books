        <h1>Chapter 862 Cody's Challenge-1</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine frowned and said, "It's normal. They don't know since I never discuss my life with my family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cody gave Marcus a thorough once-over, his eyes filled with scrutiny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a Kingston native, Cody had known Maxine for many years, and their families had always maintained good relations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in their teenage years, Cody had harbored feelings for Maxine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Maxine had consistently turned down his advances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their contact gradually diminished after he left to study at </span><span>Acoton</span><span> Military Academy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until this year when he returned and became a senior staff officer in the </span><span>Rowane</span><span> Military District, that they began reconnecting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon his return home, Cody couldn't help but notice that Maxine had grown even more beautiful than in her teenage years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had blossomed into a more feminine woman, developing a confident air that wasn't present in her younger days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These changes had reignited Cody's romantic interest in Maxine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been hoping to use this opportunity, and at the same time, Maxine asked for his help to take their relationship to the next level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't expected Maxine to reveal she had a boyfriend suddenly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, judging from their demeanor, they had been together in the patrol car earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A twinge of jealousy shot through Cody's heart as he pieced together what might have happened in that patrol car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm pretty curious about this boyfriend you're hiding from your family. What does he do that makes him so unique to you?" Cody said with a seemingly playful smile, though his eyes fixed on Marcus with an icy stare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's a local from </span><span>Solomia</span><span> with his own business in an industry we're unfamiliar with, so there's no need to discuss it further."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine replied to Cody, deliberately keeping Marcus' details private.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Marcus had always been discreet and never revealed his identity to outsiders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Cody could respond, Maxine continued, "Why don't we bring my boyfriend along to meet Special Advisor? He's really into combat techniques and has even defeated one of </span><span>Eldoria's</span><span> cyborgs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They could exchange some valuable insights," she added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cody's eyes narrowed at this revelation, and he pressed further about Marcus, saying, "</span><span>Eldoria's</span><span> cyborg technology leads the world. Your boyfriend must be quite the expert."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone suddenly shifted as he continued, "However, the Special Advisor isn't someone anyone can meet. Even I had to go through my father's connections and get approval from Ms. Gray. It was hard enough getting permission for you to come along&mdash;I'm afraid adding your boyfriend to the list won't be possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Cody had come to see Marcus as nothing but a thorn in his side, so he naturally didn't want to bring him along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine frowned and said, "Can't you make an exception just this once?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want Marcus to miss meeting with the Special Advisor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look, I've already told you it's impossible to arrange. Even for me, meeting someone of Special Advisor's status is a rare privilege, let alone your boyfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, someone like him meeting Special Advisor? That would be beneath Special Advisor's social standing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cody shook his head, his words barely concealing his contempt and disdain for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his mind, everything Maxine told him earlier was a lie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had dealt with </span><span>Eldorian</span><span> cyborgs during his time at </span><span>Acoton</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While those cyborgs looked human on the surface, they were essentially robots </span><span>enhanced through advanced technology.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power these cyborgs wielded was far beyond anything a human could match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This guy standing before him looked utterly ordinary. How could he be a match for those cyborgs?</span></p></div>
