  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Introduce to my sister? Who is this guy?" Edwin asked curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cora entered the house with the man in his thirties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cora smiled and said, "Let me introduce you. This is Atlas Cruz, the sales manager at Bayside Petroleum Company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Edwin heard this, his eyes lit up, and he asked, "Bayside Petroleum Company is the biggest oil company in our East </span><span>Uswad</span><span> region, right? Being the sales manager there must make a lot of money!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cora replied with a hint of pride, "Of course. Atlas earns two to three million dollars a year. Besides his salary, he also owns several gas stations here in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>. Together, they make at least 30 to 40 million dollars in profit each year!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At these words, Payne, Edwin, and Mia all looked shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earning 30 to 40 million dollars a year was an astronomical figure for them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Payne quickly turned to Cora and asked, "Cora, are you introducing Atlas to Natalie?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cora nodded with a smile. "Yes, I often hang out with his mother, and we became quite familiar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Atlas has been divorced for two years and is still single. His mother is anxious and wants to find him a new wife. I thought of Natalie," Cora explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Atlas greeted Payne and his family. When he smiled, his large yellow teeth were exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although not particularly handsome, Atlas was very confident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus noticed that, when greeting the Vance family, Atlas maintained a look of arrogance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Atlas saw Natalie, his eyes immediately brightened with greed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't surprising that Atlas was attracted to Natalie. She had been the class beauty when she was in school, and now, as an adult, she was even more beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What man wouldn't want to take a second glance at such a beauty?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Payne tentatively asked Cora, "Has Atlas been divorced? Does he have children?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cora smiled, "One son and one daughter. He has a complete family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, Payne. Atlas' kids are well taken care of by nannies. Natalie won't need to do anything once she marries him. She can just enjoy being a wealthy woman. I also heard Natalie say before that she doesn't want to have children.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This works out perfectly. She doesn't need to bear children or take care of them. And with Atlas being so wealthy, I think it's a great match, so I brought him here. What do you think, Payne, Mia?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mia didn't speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Atlas' conditions were indeed very impressive, she liked Marcus more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Marcus had saved her life, and she could tell that her daughter genuinely liked him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Payne laughed heartily, "Not bad. I think it's great. A man like Atlas is hard to find. Cora, you're really good to Natalie!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cora patted her chest and smiled, "Of course, I'm Natalie's aunt! Who else should I look out for if not her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edwin turned to Cora and asked, "Aunt, how much of a wedding gift can he give us? My dad said that unless it's at least five million dollars, no one can marry my sister."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Edwin's words, Atlas immediately showed a hint of disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes swept over Natalie again, and he said, "Five million dollars? That's nothing. As long as Natalie is willing to marry me, I'll give you 20 million dollars as a wedding gift!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This statement shocked Payne, Edwin, and Mia again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A 20-million-dollar wedding gift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Natalie really married him, their family would be set for life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Atlas, is this true? If my sister agrees to marry you, you'll give us 20 million dollars as a wedding gift?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edwin took a deep breath, his voice filled with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Atlas nodded. "Sure, but I have one condition. Your sister must sleep with me today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At these words, Natalie's brows immediately furrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could say anything, Payne greedily spoke, "You two are getting married anyway. It will happen sooner or later. If you want it, there's no problem. I can make it happen!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie could no longer hold back. She turned to Payne and said, "Dad, I don't even know this person. How can you just agree to something like that? Also, I already have a boyfriend. How can you promise my marriage to someone without consulting me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie knew her aunt was only pretending to introduce a wealthy man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, Cora would never be so kind-hearted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The previous men she introduced had been the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was either to please them or to ask for favors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, Cora had always used Natalie as a pawn to gain favor with others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for whether the men were a good match for Natalie or could make her happy, Cora didn't care at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She only cared about her own interests and achieving her own goals.</span><span> </span></p><div class="pagination">
