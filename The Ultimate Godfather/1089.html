        <h1>Chapter 977 Put Justice Above Family-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for your magnanimity, Mr. Fitzgerald. I'm truly in awe. In the future, if you need my help, Mr. Fitzgerald, just say the word, and I will do my utmost!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Regis led his police officers and briskly departed the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dustin said with profound respect, "Mr. Fitzgerald, if there's nothing else, I'll take my leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some who were familiar with the Solomia police system knew that this tall, upright man was the captain of the Solomia Police Department, wielding considerable power and holding a high-ranking position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, at that moment, in front of Marcus, he maintained an extremely deferential demeanor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This indicated that Marcus' identity was perhaps even more exalted than they had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus also waved his hand in dismissal of Dustin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dustin had shown up at his juncture because Marcus had sent a WhatsApp message to Lydia earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had immediately informed Dustin, who then led the Solomia Police Department personnel to the rescue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus wasn't intimidated by Regis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He simply didn't want to use his might to crush Regis. Having Dustin step in to resolve the issue and make Regis back down was the optimal outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Dustin stepped away, the scene returned to tranquility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onlookers gradually dispersed, leaving only Marcus, Morgana, and Nicole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never expected that you would be an excellent fighter and have such great wealth and a powerful identity. You're truly extraordinary."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana approached Marcus, gazing at him with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved his hand and said, "Ms. Valmont, I'm not as extraordinary as you make me out to be. I'm just the guy who barged into the girls' dormitory. Ms. Valmont, do you still want to call the police and have me arrested?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His teasing words made Morgana's pretty face immediately blush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she thought about the harsh words she'd hurled at him earlier, a pang of guilt stabbed at her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A man of Marcus' stature would never stoop to barging into the girls' dormitory to do something indecent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Surely, with a simple gesture, he could have countless girls flocking to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said to Morgana, "If there's nothing else, I'll be off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then dashed upstairs and lugged Nicole's luggage down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a huge package, weighing 90 to 100 pounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Melinda had called Marcus to come and help carry it home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Nicole's petite frame, there was no way she could handle such a heavy load.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Valmont, my brother and I are leaving now. Goodbye."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nicole politely waved farewell to Morgana.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Marcus' actions today had also greatly impressed Nicole, her shock wasn't as intense as Morgana's because she had long known that Marcus was a man of many talents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, Marcus drove his Alphard and took Nicole and her luggage back to the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That afternoon, Marcus had a meal with Richard, Melinda, and Nicole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he was about to drive his Toyota Alphard back to the Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had just started the car when his phone rang with an unknown number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He instinctively answered, and a clear, melodious voice filtered through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, is that you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus found the voice enchanting and familiar and felt as if he had heard it somewhere before, but he couldn't recall it at the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He asked, "Who is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice on the other end replied, "We met just today. Have you already forgotten?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A-Are you Morgana?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It then dawned on Marcus that apart from Morgana, he hadn't interacted with any other women during the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, it's me. Mr. Fitzgerald, to express my gratitude for your help today, I'd like to invite you to dinner. Would you like to come, Mr. Fitzgerald?" Morgana asked, her voice laced with anticipation.</span></p></div>
