        <h1>Chapter 738 You Know What Happened</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had been about to walk out the door, but when he looked at Lucy, he couldn't help but feel a pang of sympathy. She looked so vulnerable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sighed and walked over to the bed. But the moment he got close, Lucy lunged at him like a wild animal, wrapping her arms around him and kissing him with a desperation that took his breath away. It was like she was trying to devour him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, please. I need you. I need you inside me. Now," she </span><span>whispered,</span><span> her voice thick with desire. Her eyes were hazy, and her body was trembling against his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on," Marcus said, gently pushing her back onto the bed. "I'll help you get rid of whatever they gave you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force of the movement seemed to snap Lucy out of her lustful daze for a moment. But the drug quickly took hold again, dragging her back into a whirlpool of desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucy's breaths came in ragged gasps, and her hands roamed over her body, her fingers finding their way to her most intimate places. She was lost in a fog of desire, her body craving more and more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus could see the desperation in her eyes, and it broke his heart a little. He focused, channeling Timeless Numinous Energy into her, hoping to counteract the aphrodisiac.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus scanned the room, his eyes landing on a pink vibrator sitting on the coffee table. He picked it up and walked back to the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To his surprise, Lucy's expression had once again become dazed, her moans more intoxicating than ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was taken aback&mdash;his Timeless Numinous Energy was known for its powerful healing properties, yet it couldn't fully suppress the drug coursing through Lucy's veins. It seemed the only way to neutralize it was through intimacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the aphrodisiac surged back, Lucy tried to tear off Marcus' pants. But Marcus pinned her back down. He positioned the vibrator at her most intimate spot and pushed it in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a soft pop, and Lucy let out a high-pitched cry as her body convulsed, releasing more fluid. She reached her climax almost instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus switched on the vibrator, its hum filling the room as it began to vibrate at a high frequency. Lucy's body seemed to come alive, her moans turning into a symphony of pleasure. With each thrust of the vibrator, guided by Marcus' hand, she felt waves of intense stimulation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh... Yes... It feels so good. I'm so full. Marcus, harder... Please, I need more..." Lucy's face was flushed, her legs spread wide as if inviting Marcus to take her even deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus increased the speed and set the vibrator to its highest setting. Under this intense stimulation, Lucy quickly reached her second climax, even more powerful than the first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body convulsed, and a burst of fluid sprayed out. Her expression was one of pure ecstasy, her mind momentarily blank as she rode the wave of pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't deny that, despite his less-than-favorable impression of Lucy, she was undeniably beautiful. Unlike Lila, who exuded an elegant and gentle charm, Lucy had a more petite and delicate allure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was around five feet, with a perfect body proportion. Her breasts were firm and full, and her delicate features were strikingly beautiful, giving Marcus a powerful visual impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the vibrator continued its relentless stimulation, Lucy's hands clutched Marcus' strong arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a sudden burst of energy, she sat up, pulled up Marcus' T-shirt, and ran her tongue over his nipple&mdash;one of his most sensitive spots. Already overwhelmed by the sight of her, Marcus felt a jolt of desire. But he didn't want to take advantage of her. He just wanted to help her get through this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harder... Please, Marcus. I need it harder," Lucy begged, her voice barely recognizable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave it everything he had, but even the vibrator's battery died before Lucy's desire was fully sated. Her body was still slick with sweat, her lower half a mess of need. She was panting, her eyes wild with want.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, please... Kiss my breasts. They feel so empty. Please." Lucy held her breasts, her eyes filled with longing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus realized that the vibrator alone wouldn't be enough to neutralize the drug. He needed to add more stimulation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He leaned down and took Lucy's pink, pert nipple into his mouth. Instantly, Lucy's face lit up with intense satisfaction, and she let out another intoxicating moan, reaching another climax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus knew he was close to helping her. He continued to kiss her nipple while increasing the speed of the vibrator, which now thrust furiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, there were no pauses. The speed and intensity only grew, and Lucy's desire kept climbing higher and higher. Finally, in one explosive moment, she let go completely. In that instant, the overwhelming wave of pleasure cleared the drug from her system.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucy collapsed onto the bed, completely spent, gasping for breath as if she had lost consciousness for a moment. The entire ordeal had lasted over an hour, with Marcus working at full intensity the whole time. His right arm was sore, but seeing Lucy finally satisfied, he let out a sigh of relief and collapsed beside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few minutes, Lucy's eyes fluttered open. She looked at Marcus, her cheeks burning with embarrassment. She quickly grabbed a towel and wrapped it around herself, her eyes wide with confusion. "What... what did you just do to me?" she stammered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow. "You know exactly what happened, Lucy. You were there </span><span>the whole time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucy bit her lip, her eyes darting around the room. She remembered bits and pieces, flashes of desire and need, but it was all so jumbled. The thought of how she'd acted, how she'd begged and pleaded, made her want to disappear.</span></p></div>
