  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail turned away with hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man had not been involved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't dare to speak, for fear that he would say something wrong and be blamed by Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are your plans for the future?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked at the middle-aged man and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man said, "Since I have chosen to submit to you, I'll be at your disposal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said this partly to save his life, but also to see Marcus' reaction. Marcus was much stronger than him, and he was usually not qualified to come into contact with this kind of person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as Marcus was willing to give him a little support, the man could be successful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said, "Since you have chosen to submit to me, some things must be made clear in advance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stood with his hands behind his back, exuding the aura of a strong man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am all ears."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man bowed and spoke respectfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said, "Since you have chosen to submit to me, you </span><span>can not</span><span> betray me. If I find out that you have even a hint of rebellion, I will kill you immediately!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' tone was cold and unmistakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man shuddered. He was forced to surrender because of Marcus' strength and had ulterior motives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after feeling the aura from Marcus, the middle-aged man was a little afraid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that Marcus was a man of his words and decisive in killing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he betrayed Marcus, he would have a terrible death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man said, "I understand!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Use this pill to heal the beast. And this one for your own cultivation. If nothing goes wrong, your cultivation will be able to break through the Ancient Martial Stage Two in about seven days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus took out two pills from his Spatial Ring and handed them to the middle-aged man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These two pills were just ordinary pills for healing injuries and improving cultivation, and he had a lot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After killing the old man at the Ancient Martial Stage Four, the more than one hundred pills Marcus obtained were much better than these two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the eyes of the middle-aged man, these two pills were treasures that he could never obtain in his entire life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He immediately showed a look of ecstasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, "Sir, thank you very much. I am willing to serve you for the rest of my life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved at the middle-aged man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man stood up and walked to the giant beast that was seriously injured by Marcus' punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fed the beast a pill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, a magical scene happened!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the effect of the pill, the injuries on the beast were recovering quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was completely restored to its original state in less than two minutes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beast roared as if expressing gratitude to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene stunned everyone present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never thought that there was such a magical pill in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The beast that was previously dying and unable to move recovered quickly just by taking a pill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was a miracle!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such things seemed to only appear in myths!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miracle..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man trembled and was happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly came to Marcus and wanted to thank him again, but was stopped by Marcus. Marcus said, "Since you have chosen to submit to me, I will not treat you unfairly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I guess you have guessed the reason why I came here. Do you know the whereabouts of energy crystals?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man was stunned for a moment, then said, "Energy crystals are mysterious and do not appear in the sight of ordinary people. In the trading market, any merchant who uses energy crystals as a selling point is doing shady business. Their abilities are not enough to get in touch with the crystals."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speaking, the middle-aged man took out a bag from his arms, took out a stone that emitted waves of energy, and handed it to Marcus. "This is what I got in Southern Market many years ago. Please!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus took the crystal stone and felt the energy fluctuations emanating from it. Then, he returned it to the middle-aged man, saying, "Where is Southern Market you mentioned? Take me there tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why? You don't want to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The middle-aged man said, "Sir, you have misunderstood. Southern Market has strict rules and regulations. Ordinary people are not qualified to go there. I was lucky enough to enter the market with a master last time. I heard that the master also paid a huge price."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said, "Just tell me the exact location. And you don't need to worry about the rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally had a lead on the energy crystals and was looking forward to it.</span></p><div class="pagination">
