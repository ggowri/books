        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she said this, the boy named John became angry and embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stepped forward and said, "You can quit. To tell you the truth, we invited Mr. Park here today. We wanted to let you have some fun, but you followed this man and hid here for fun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about you run one lap with us for the last time? As long as your time is less than 30 seconds behind Mr. Park, we won't bother you anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he said this, everyone's expressions suddenly froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had heard from John that Edison had been invited today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edison, once the king of Racing, created a glorious history of three consecutive championships.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, he was forced to retire due to an injury in a competition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John was taught by Edison, and he was also the most skilled person in their circle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could be said that when it came to the racing circle, everyone knew Edison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone regarded Edison as a belief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even John, who had the best performance in the circle, had a best result that was more than 50 seconds slower than Edison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, John improved Melina's performance to less than 30 seconds, which was an impossible task!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was normal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the circle knew that John liked Melina, and Melina suddenly wanted to quit the circle, which was something John didn't want to see.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina's secret dining with other men in this restaurant further aroused John's jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina frowned and said, "John, are you kidding me? Even you can't achieve this result. How can you make me do it? Is that possible?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The best grade of Melina was over one minute slower than Edison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, she hadn't run in the mountains for a long time, so her results might decline further. She couldn't lose to Edison by less than 30 seconds!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This has nothing to do with me. I'm just making my request. Whether you can complete it is your own business!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John shrugged and said with a sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, he glanced in the direction where Marcus was, with a hint of contempt in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if I don't agree?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina gritted her teeth and said that John was bullying her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't agree, we will pester you every day, and I will tell my dad to cancel all cooperation with your family. You can think about the consequences yourself. I don't want to say anything more!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just didn't want to see Melina quit the circle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina's chest heaved with anger, and she looked at him with a cold look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have no choice. This is my bottom line!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was extremely tough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he looked at Marcus again and said, "Melina, if you can't do it, you can let him do it. I believe in your vision. The man you like must be good, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as he said this, all the people present laughed, with a gleam of sarcasm in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked ordinary and might not even be able to drive. How could he possibly do it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not to mention competing with Edison, Marcus was not worthy at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"John, are you kidding me? He is an outsider. You are bullying him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blond girl said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others laughed again and didn't take John's words seriously at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't go too far. This is a matter between us. There's no need to involve Mr. Fitzgerald!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina was also getting a little anxious and disliked John.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although John was also very outstanding with a better family background, Melina just couldn't stand his arrogant look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her opinion, a truly strong person would not bother to show off his or her strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was an extremely low-key person, and his strength could not be seen at all, but he often made a splash at critical moments!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was also an important reason why Melina admired Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How am I bullying others? We are all human beings with hands and feet. If he is a man, he should fight for his woman, unless he is a coward!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He sneered and spoke more excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other people all started to make a noise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that he also wanted to see Marcus make a fool of himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about it? Would you consider racing with us?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John looked at Marcus and asked in a provocative tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus then put down the coffee cup in his hand, glanced at the other party, and said, "Everyone present here is not worthy of being my opponent."</span></p></div>
