  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if I told you your position is no longer yours to hold? Would you believe me?" Marcus sneered as he looked at Hank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never expected Hank to be so arrogant as to openly disregard the law and forcefully demand that Dustin release Dexter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had seen officials more powerful than Hank before, but no one dared openly flout the law like Hank did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as soon as he finished speaking, everyone present froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They even thought they had heard wrong or were imagining things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Someone thought, "This guy actually said Hank Foster's position was no longer his to hold? Who does he think he is? Does he really think of himself as some high-ranking official? It's absolutely laughable!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dexter, Hank, and Helen all turned to Marcus, each wearing a mocking grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dexter, in particular, almost laughed himself silly. He was laughing so hard that he couldn't catch his breath, clutching his stomach as he said to Marcus, "Kid, you sound like you can force out my cousin. You're so ignorant and arrogant. Let me tell you something: Only those in Kingston have the authority to take action against my cousin. No one in Solomia has that kind of influence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're just a young man in your early twenties, and you're already spouting off like that. It's really laughable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dexter seemed ready to say more, but Hank raised a hand to stop him, his gaze fixed on Marcus as he said, "You're the most interesting and the most arrogant young person I've ever met."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm curious&mdash;how do you intend to force me out of this position? By the way, this building's surrounded by the State Tactical Force. No one can get out without my orders."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone present was stunned to learn that Hank had brought the State Tactical Force with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he was older, it was clear he was sharp and calculating, leaving no detail to chance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He must have come with the State Tactical Force because he feared that Dustin and the others wouldn't obey his orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been prepared to command the State Tactical Force to suppress any defiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dustin quickly understood what was going on and broke into a cold sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily, he hadn't resisted Hank too fiercely. Otherwise, if the State Tactical Force moved, they would all be turned into Swiss cheese.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though they were from the criminal investigation unit, their power was nothing compared to that of the State Tactical Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, the police were only equipped with light arms, such as pistols and grenades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the State Tactical Force had heavier weapons, just like the military.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a contest of strength, the criminal police would be powerless against the State Tactical Force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people couldn't help but take a sharp breath at this thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Dexter and Helen couldn't help but give Hank a thumbs-up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With an excited grin, Dexter said, "Hank, you're amazing. You've thought of everything. If it were us, we might've been taken advantage of by these punks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With the State Tactical Force backing you up, I can't wait to see how these little rats think they'll escape your grip!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, his eyes scanned Marcus, Kiera, and Dustin, full of mocking disdain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hank added, "Young man, I know you are working for Benjamin. You got appreciated by him at your age. You must be something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you're too inexperienced to challenge me. Now do you see the difference between us? It's not just about status. When it comes to tactics, you're still way behind. You have a lot to learn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Too bad you won't have the chance to learn. None of you have any chances left. With just one command, I can turn you all into Swiss cheese. By the time that's done, you'll be framed for attacking a government official, and this will all just blow over. Got it?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
