  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus retorted with a sneer, "Our love cannot be measured with money. Ten million dollars? You could multiply that sum ten thousandfold, and still, I would not forsake Josie. Got it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His firm refusal stunned people around, and they couldn't help looking at him with various opinions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie, on the other hand, smiled from the bottom of her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew he meant it. Nothing would break the bond between them, let alone money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Molly, Hannah, and Joshua all smiled in great disdain after hearing what Marcus said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Molly said, "No wonder she lost her mind for you. I'd say you really have some parlor tricks. Sweet words and good control of timing. That's impressive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she turned to Josie to remind her, "Insatiability hides behind honeyed words, Josie. Even 10 million dollars won't satisfy him. Be careful about your property, honey. He might have been scheming against you for a longer time than you think. Don't jeopardize your assets for a man. Just take my advice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something crossed Hannah's mind as she also said, "Molly was right. We all have been in a similar desperation just like what she said. This loser aims at your billion-dollar property and is going to play a long game to snatch it. Don't lose your sanity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just break up with this guy to save yourself from unpredictable trouble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you break up with him now, Josie, Joshua will still be there for you. This man, a better man than Marcus, has pursued you for decades. Why can't you just give him a chance?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their persuasion also enlightened people around them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many of them started chattering in low voices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They realized how naive they had been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the deep affection of this young man for Josie was a lousy defrauding plan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The resistance to the seduction of immense money would be attractive to Josie more than ever. By the time she loved him to the extent of madness, he would gain far more than just 10 million dollars!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Josie said resolutely, "Girls, I appreciate that, but I still have to tell you that I will not break up with Marcus!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Molly and Hannah all looked very disappointed in disbelief as they never expected their bestie to be a fool because of a liar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her insistence also broke Joshua's heart and self-composure as he couldn't help but ask, "Josie, I have been in love with you for years. Thanks to this party, I can finally ask you why this gigolo matters more than me in your heart. Please, please just let me know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he said that, Joshua fixed his fierce eyes on Marcus and said, "Josie and I are more than classmates, kiddo. You might have still pissed your pants when I had a crush on her. If you want our consent to your relationship, you have to at least prove you're more capable than me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the people present nodded in agreement with his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I agree with Joshua. Prove yourself if you want us to accept this relationship. Joshua is now in the industry of pharmaceutical raw material processing with an annual profit of around 20 to 30 billion dollars. Can you earn more than him?" said Hannah.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Arrogance permeated her words as in her views, such a number would undoubtedly overshadow Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Molly nodded since she also thought so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their minds, Marcus was a gold-digger who could barely afford Joshua's breakfast. He would never, ever be able to be compared with Joshua in terms of property.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the people around had the same idea as them. So, after Hannah finished speaking, a lot of them cast curious eyes on Marcus, looking forward to his embarrassing face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, glancing over Molly, Hannah, and Joshua, asked, "Does he mainly supply Golden Pharmaceutical Manufacture?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason he asked that was because he heard Joshua mentioning his cooperation with the Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, he didn't even know one of his downstream suppliers was Joshua until he brought it up himself today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hannah said, "Yeah. The Golden Group's pharmaceutical factory is booming. Just two months after being listed, several kinds of patent medicine went viral in the industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Its sales volume is almost among the top five of that of domestic pharmaceutical companies. It's a miracle for a newly listed company to achieve it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My husband negotiated with Golden Pharmaceutical Manufacture on behalf of McHale Pharmaceuticals Group to purchase the formula of their patent medicine but failed. It means that they have already had the competence to rival with international pharmaceutical firms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think I should say no more to let you know how impressive it is for Joshua to be Golden Pharmaceutical Manufacture's supply, should I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, Hannah's introduction surprised many who were not familiar with Golden Pharmaceutical Manufacture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A start-up company that ranked in the top five among all the pharmaceutical companies in Uswad with its unique patents would surely embrace a bright commercial future and probably stand for the pharmaceutical industry of Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to Hannah, Joshua's business would also take off with the Golden Group's pharmaceutical development. It was indeed a stunning achievement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, after Hannah finished, Joshua immediately wore an arrogant smile and provoked Marcus with his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to the Golden Group's pharmaceutical success, Marcus couldn't win him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The confidence and disdain on the three people's faces irritated Josie so much that she almost lost her temper because what they mentioned to brag about Joshua was exactly Marcus' corporate, which led Josie to know this very man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, they used Marcus' achievement to degrade him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie never felt more urgent than this moment to defend Marcus but eventually dismissed it as she realized that no matter what she said, it was impossible to sway their stubbornness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, I'm indeed impressed." However, Hannah's words didn't daunt Marcus. He remained calm and replied, "I can make it more impressive: I can cancel his cooperation with one phone call."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words stunned everyone and even made them doubt if there was something wrong with their ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, they all had the same thought: this man must be too insane to refrain himself from bullshit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought that he seemed to hypnotize himself to firmly believe that he was the very person in charge of the Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was known to everyone who knew the Golden Group that its CEO was Michelle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, everyone found it amusing for Marcus to try to intimidate Joshua with such a lame lie.</span></p><div class="pagination">
