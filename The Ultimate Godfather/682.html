        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Ada approached Marcus and begged, "These individuals are so stupid that they have offended you. I hope you can forgive them and spare their lives."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He furrowed his brow just a bit. Naturally, he grasped her motive and smiled, "Since you've gone to such lengths to protect them, how can I possibly refuse?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Ada had not shown up in the nick of time, these guys would have been dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was embarrassed, never expecting him to see through her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you still standing there for? Get out of here right now. Are you seeking death again?" she urged, as if fearing that Marcus would change his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cold sweat beaded on Dutton and the others' foreheads, and they scurried away in haste.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It never crossed his mind that he would actually engage in a fight with such a formidable figure in the ring previously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ada had mentioned, Marcus had sufficient power to obliterate the Celestial Arc Order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Consequently, during his fight against Dutton, Marcus clearly restrained his strength. Otherwise, Dutton would not have been able to endure even a single strike and would have been easily killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, rather than harboring resentment over the ruination of his cultivation, Dutton experienced a sense of having narrowly escaped a great disaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for letting them off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada stared at Marcus, and her lovely face was brimming with gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hand and said, "You once claimed to be my woman. So, of course, I have to give you some face."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada's lovely cheeks flushed a deep red. Then, as if she was suddenly reminded of some indescribable incident, her expression swiftly turned sullen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, there is no need to bring up the past again. Let's just act as if nothing occurred."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled nonchalantly, "If you can pretend that nothing occurred, then I certainly have no objections."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada bit her lip and was at a loss for words to reply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, their one-night stand was just a fleeting romantic interlude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to Ada, it meant something different.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was raped and lost her virginity, which she had held for 120 years...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could she really pretend that nothing had happened?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the very least, she wasn't capable of doing it within this time frame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whenever it was late at night, Ada's mind would be haunted by the memory of the time she had sex with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What filled her with shame was that as the days passed, the sense of humiliation she had once felt when recalling that incident gradually faded. Instead, the intense excitement she had experienced back then would resurface vividly in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She even longed for another time.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whenever such an idea crossed Ada's mind, she was seized by an impulse to take her own life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always been a woman of strict virtue and was regarded as a paragon of chastity in the world of Ancient Martial Art in Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada was raped by Marcus. By all accounts, she ought to consider him her sworn enemy, with the sole and unwavering objective of killing him to exact revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at present, she didn't appear to have such a scheme. On the contrary, after she met him again, her heart couldn't help beating fast, and the scenes of their intimate moments surfaced in her mind unbidden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just thinking about the exciting parts made her body tingle with a faint warmth and kindled a spark of desire within her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong with me? Am I really an immoral woman?" Ada wondered, and her gaze at Marcus became more and more complicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He felt a little scared and couldn't help but ask, "Why are you looking at me in this way?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, Ada was indeed a stunning beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her fresh, pure appearance was especially to Marcus' liking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, her ethereal temperament gave him a strong desire to get her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing..." Ada didn't know how to answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, several spiritual powers abruptly emerged out of thin air in the void and rushed towards this area, with Ada as their target.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a dark face, she immediately waved to Marcus and said, "My enemies are here, so I'm leaving now. Goodbye!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada was ready to unleash her energy and make her departure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the moment she released her energy, a mouthful of blood spurted from her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood was black-purple in color, exuding waves of toxicity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are injured."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus took a step forward and supported Ada.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their physical contact made her heart race.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am fine. I'll just find a deserted place and take some time to recover."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is chasing you?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is the Bloodthirsty Cult from Southvaia. Lately, they've been eyeing an expansion of their influence into Uswad. Evidently, upon learning the news that Mr. Spacey had passed away, they dispatched their experts to eliminate me with the intention of seizing the treasures of our sect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After my death, they can take over the Celestial Arc Order without restraint," Ada replied, her delicate features contorted with anger.</span></p></div>
