  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew had always had high expectations for Maxine, even considering her as a potential successor to the family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, if Maxine could marry into the Whitman family, it would be a good match, one that not only served both families' interests but also offered Maxine a secure future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man standing before him, Marcus, was someone Matthew knew little about, his background a complete mystery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew couldn't bear the thought of his precious granddaughter being with someone like Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine bit her lip, her mood plummeting as she gazed at the disdainful expressions of the Burnett family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A surge of resentment welled up inside her, and without thinking, she took Marcus' arm. "Grandpa, Aunt Ruth, you were right. Marcus is the person I love. The reason I brought him here today is to announce this to everyone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have someone I love. He treats me well, and he loves me. I will never marry Shaun. If I marry, it will be Marcus and no one else!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words were firm and clear, and everyone present could hear them clearly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of astonishment swept through the crowd, and all eyes were on Maxine!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, this is unexpected. Maxine actually has someone she likes, and this man seems unfamiliar. I've never seen him before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it's really hard to understand. She's willing to give up her noble status and comfortable life to be with someone who doesn't seem to have anything to his name. Sir Burnett is probably furious right now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Whitman family will be here soon. This is going to be interesting. I can't wait to see how the Burnett family handles this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Maxine and Marcus became the center of attention for everyone in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes widened slightly, but he couldn't bring himself to feel anything in the moment. The warmth and softness from Maxine's hand on his arm didn't stir him in </span><span>the slightest. He had not anticipated such a bold and reckless move from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seemingly overwhelmed with emotion, Matthew stood up from his wheelchair, leaning heavily on his cane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With trembling hands, he pointed at Marcus and asked, "Maxine, what did you just say? I didn't catch that. Did you say you would only marry this man?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine nodded resolutely. "Grandpa, forgive me, but I will only marry Marcus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing those words, Matthew felt darkness cloud his vision. His body swayed as if he might collapse at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thankfully, Hazel and the others rushed over to support him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... how can you be so stubborn? Why must you marry someone like him? All the love I've given you... is it all in vain?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Matthew clutched his chest, his face contorted in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad... Dad, what's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandpa..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Owen, Malcolm, Hazel, Stella, and Arnold quickly surrounded him, their faces filled with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hazel took out a heart medication and fed it to Matthew, helping him breathe more easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maxine, your grandfather is in poor health. How can you continue to upset him like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Besides, Mr. Whitman is the heir to the Whitman family. He's far better than Marcus in every way. We all want you to have a good future. You're truly disappointing us all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ruth stood tall, once again questioning Maxine, positioning herself on the moral high ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, we all want the best for you. You've let us all down."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Malcolm put on a stern look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine snapped, cutting him off. "All of you are only thinking about your own interests. Who here has ever considered mine? Today, I'm living for myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she turned to face the crowd, raised herself on tiptoe, and kissed Marcus right there in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus caught completely off guard, had no time to react before Maxine's lips met his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene left everyone frozen in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the flashes of cameras filled the air, capturing the explosive moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine, daughter of the Burnett family, at her grandfather's 80th birthday party, kissing a stranger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a scandalous moment would surely be </span><span>headline</span><span> news, dominating every front page the next day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the doors to the banquet hall swung open once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of people entered, their presence commanding the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were from the Whitman family in Kingston, led by a tall, impeccably dressed man. None other than Shaun, the heir to the Whitman family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With gifts in hand, Shaun walked confidently into the hall, ready to celebrate Matthew's birthday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as his eyes fell on the scene of Maxine kissing Marcus, he froze, his expression a mix of shock and disbelief.</span></p><div class="pagination">
