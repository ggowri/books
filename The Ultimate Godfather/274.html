Asher looked indignant and asked for Phoenix's permission as he stepped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the disabled Truman, Phoenix also looked dismal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Recently, many of my disciples have been killed by an ordinary young man. Is he also held accountable for disabling Truman?" Phoenix asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Morris, please allow me to avenge my son!" With bloodshots in his eyes, Asher almost lost his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had hope for his only soon. Now, it was utterly shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher couldn't accept that. It didn't matter whether the murderer did this to his son by himself or not; he just wanted to vent his rage by killing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Phoenix said, "Elder Dupont, please calm down. The whole organization feels sorrowful for the torture Truman had. But it's a little weird if the murderer did that alone, which also indicated that this young man might have a special background."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We're ranked as the three most powerful Ancient Martial Art organizations in Uswad, not in the entire world! If he comes from a foreign organization or works for the Godfather, we will seek our destruction by hunting him!" he added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Phoenix remained rational and advised Asher to calm down for the greater good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Morris, I just can't help it! I'll go revenge for my son anyway!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher no longer took any advice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Phoenix tried to persuade him again, Asher had left the hall with Truman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Father, those guys called him Mr. Fitzgerald. He must come from the mainland," Truman said with clenched teeth on a stretcher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Being disabled, he would never be able to get his power back in his life. He would rather be killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry. When your injuries stabilize, I'll avenge you even though Mr. Morris opposes that! I'll tear the murderer apart!" Asher said with a cold and dominating voice. The aura of an expert at the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Five also broke out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The whole space became depressed, as if the time ceased!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't know about this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For a week, he used his X-ray vision to appraise and sort the raw crystals in Grand Fortune without the slightest laziness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The reason for his hard work was very simple: he had made 40% of the net profit of the Grand Fortune these seven days. The more he worked, the more he earned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And through his appraisal and classification, the profits of this place suddenly surged from five hundred billion dollars at ordinary times to eight hundred billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The highest daily profit even broke through a thousand billion dollars!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a really astonishing amount of money in the mundane world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even those dominant enterprises in the mundane world wouldn't be able to earn so much money within a day, let alone there were no more than fifty companies with a daily net profit of ten billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in the world of the Ancient Martial Arts, money seemed to be some worthless pebbles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although the Grand Fortune was the biggest stone gambling store in Southern Market, it looked just like a stone processing plant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the stones they processed were valuable energy crystals.</span></p><div class="pagination">
