        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Devouring Power worked similarly to Celestial Reversal, which would play a surprise role in the battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Marcus didn't know how many benefits the Devouring Power would bring him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It could only be verified in battles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Soon, the sky dawned as he finally got familiar with the Devouring Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After washing his face, Marcus found more and more people in the Southern Market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>According to the agreement with Vanessa, he had to appraise and grade the raw crystals in Grand Fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Since his working area was in the backyard, no guest noticed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Astral Serpent Order was one of the three organizations of Uswad's Ancient Martial Art's world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was located in the mountains in southern Uswad and had various legends and unsolved mysteries here since ancient times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>There were even rumors that this mountain range was the residence of immortals, and ordinary people would offend them if they set foot on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, the relevant authorities of Uswad directly banned the steep terrain of this mountain range, not allowing anyone without official permission to enter this area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Overlooking the mountain range from the plane, no one would find anything special except the steep mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the banned area was shrouded in white fog all the year round.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In fact, it was the place of the Astral Serpent Order's base.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Due to their mysterious identity, warriors seldom appeared in public, and they would also set some Runes to prevent their bases from being seen by ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Southern Market also adopted such a method to avoid the distractions of the mundane world and also save them from panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In a hall of the Astral Serpent Order, Phoenix, together with Asher and other senior leaders, gathered here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the middle of the hall, Truman lay on a stretcher with miserable injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Morris, please allow me to attack in revenge of my son!" Asher looked indignant and asked for Phoenix's permission as he stepped forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Looking at the disabled Truman, Phoenix also looked dismal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Recently, many of my disciples have been killed by an ordinary young man. Is he also held accountable for disabling Truman?" Phoenix asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Morris, please allow me to avenge my son!" With bloodshots in his eyes, Asher almost lost his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had hope for his only soon. Now, it was utterly shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher couldn't accept that. It didn't matter whether the murderer did this to his son by himself or not; he just wanted to vent his rage by killing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Phoenix said, "Elder Dupont, please calm down. The whole organization feels sorrowful for the torture Truman had. But it's a little weird if the murderer did that alone, which also indicated that this young man might have a special background."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We're ranked as the three most powerful Ancient Martial Art organizations in Uswad, not in the entire world! If he comes from a foreign organization or works for the Godfather, we will seek our destruction by hunting him!" he added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Phoenix remained rational and advised Asher to calm down for the greater good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Morris, I just can't help it! I'll go revenge for my son anyway!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher no longer took any advice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Phoenix tried to persuade him again, Asher had left the hall with Truman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Father, those guys called him Mr. Fitzgerald. He must come from the mainland," Truman said with clenched teeth on a stretcher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Being disabled, he would never be able to get his power back in his life. He would rather be killed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't worry. When your injuries stabilize, I'll avenge you even though Mr. Morris opposes that! I'll tear the murderer apart!" Asher said with a cold and dominating voice. The aura of an expert at the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Five also broke out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The whole space became depressed, as if the time ceased!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't know about this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For a week, he used his X-ray vision to appraise and sort the raw crystals in Grand Fortune without the slightest laziness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The reason for his hard work was very simple: he had made 40% of the net profit of the Grand Fortune these seven days. The more he worked, the more he earned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And through his appraisal and classification, the profits of this place suddenly surged from five hundred billion dollars at ordinary times to eight hundred billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The highest daily profit even broke through a thousand billion dollars!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a really astonishing amount of money in the mundane world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even those dominant enterprises in the mundane world wouldn't be able to earn so much money within a day, let alone there were no more than fifty companies with a daily net profit of ten billion dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But in the world of the Ancient Martial Arts, money seemed to be some worthless pebbles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although the Grand Fortune was the biggest stone gambling store in Southern Market, it looked just like a stone processing plant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the stones they processed were valuable energy crystals.</span></p></div>
