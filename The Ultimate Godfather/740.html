        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't answer Lucy. Instead, he headed to the bathroom, rinsing his mouth and scrubbing the dirt off his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucy bit her lower lip, the feeling of being rejected for the first time stirring a strange sense of disappointment in her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He... he's dead." Looking at Zachary's lifeless body, sprawled in a pool of blood on the floor, Lucy was terrified, fear clearly showing in her eyes as she turned to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave a casual nod. "If there's nothing else, I'm leaving." With that, he turned to walk away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucy jumped off the bed, grabbing his wrist. "I'm scared. Please wait for me... take me with you, please?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at </span><span>her,</span><span> his tone dry. "Hurry up, then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be quick." Lucy hurried into the bathroom, quickly cleaning up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes flicked back to the bed, noticing the faint red stains on the sheets. It seemed like this was Lucy's first time. It was widely known that a woman's first time was important, but Lucy's had been with a toy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't help but wonder how her future husband would feel about that&mdash;whether he'd be mad or relieved? </span><span>But,</span><span> that wasn't Marcus' problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once Lucy was done, she quickly got dressed and returned to the room. Not wanting to make things awkward, Marcus turned away, giving her privacy. Lucy caught his action, and surprisingly, a small feeling of affection for him stirred in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm ready, let's go," she said softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus turned around, he saw her dressed in a blue dress. The outfit gave her a delicate, refined look that seemed to match her down-to-earth charm. For a moment, it caught him off guard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having previously used spiritual powers to block out the outside world, no one in the hotel knew what had happened. Marcus quietly led Lucy out of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucy glanced back at the hotel as they got into his car. "You killed Zachary. Are we really just going to leave like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why, what else do you suggest? You want to wait for the cops to arrest you?" Marcus' tone was sharp, clearly annoyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had always thought of Lucy as someone who seemed sharp on the surface, but was actually a bit naive&mdash;and even a little foolish. Now, seeing her up close, he realized his impression was spot on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucy fell silent, her voice still tinged with uncertainty as she asked, "What I mean is, even if we leave, they'll still come after us, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sighed, clearly impatient, "You really think I'd go to all the trouble of killing Zachary without making any preparations?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucy blinked, her long lashes fluttering before she replied, "I guess you did."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then what's the problem?" Marcus shot back, growing more frustrated. He had no patience for stupidity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucy seemed to sense his growing irritation and fell silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car finally reached a spot a few miles away from the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, and Marcus pulled over to the side of the road. "This should be far enough. You can get out here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucy shot him a reluctant glance. "It's still raining. Can't you take me home? I'm a girl, you know. A little chivalry wouldn't hurt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus frowned, clearly annoyed. "I've already done enough&mdash;took care of your mess, got you out of the hotel. Don't push it." He looked at her seriously. "We're not exactly friends, so just get out. I've got other things to do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reluctantly, Lucy bit her lip and got out of the car. But as soon as she stepped onto the rain-soaked road, the rain suddenly picked up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had half expected Marcus to soften up and invite her back into the car, but instead, he didn't even glance her way. He hit the gas, and the car sped off, leaving her standing there in the pouring rain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucy couldn't help but stomp her feet in frustration, staring after his retreating car. She didn't understand why Marcus hated her so much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "Is it because I am not pretty enough? That seems impossible. I am not exactly a confident person, but I know I am attractive. Besides, that guy has just done what he did to me&mdash;he'd seen me at my most vulnerable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, he hasn't shown even a flicker of tenderness. He'd just left me out there in the rain, without a second thought."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucy sighed and hailed a taxi, her mind swirling with images of what had happened in the hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Zachary had drugged her, the sensations were still fresh, and she could still feel the powerful emotions from the moment everything had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as vivid as those memories were, so too </span><span>were</span><span> the cold words Marcus had spoken to her, especially that one line: "We're not exactly friends." It stung like nothing else, striking straight at her pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't sure if she'd ever see him again&mdash;the man who'd taken her first time from her. But today would definitely be a day she'd never forget.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The body of Zachary wasn't discovered until the next day. His death sent shockwaves through </span><span>Solomia</span><span>, particularly in the entertainment world. As the founder of Royal Entertainment, his murder was a bombshell that rocked the entire industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police quickly launched an investigation, and soon realized that his death was eerily similar to a series of recent beheadings in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The similarities were striking. First, the victims were all high-profile figures. Second, the methods used were brutal and efficient. Third, the killer left no trace&mdash;no tools, no clues. And fourth, all nearby surveillance cameras mysteriously malfunctioned after the killings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was these circumstances that made identifying the killer nearly impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police traced hotel records and found Lucy's name. After further investigation, </span><span>they determined she was another victim. Zachary had secretly drugged her after kidnapping her to the hotel's penthouse suite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the time of the murder, Lucy was still under the effects of the drugs, and she had a solid alibi&mdash;she could truthfully claim she knew nothing about the murder. The case became another "unexplained beheading".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Zachary's death threw Royal Entertainment into chaos. The company's stock plummeted, and numerous movie and performance bookings were canceled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For anyone familiar with the stock market, it was a classic "buying opportunity"&mdash;but no one dared to act.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason was simple: Zachary had been the cornerstone of Royal Entertainment. With his death, the company was left with a gaping hole, and its stock seemed destined to spiral into an abyss.</span></p></div>
