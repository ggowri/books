  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was Kiera, Darian's younger brother's wife.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus first met her when he rescued Darian's son.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Later, he even used the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire to help her with a medical issue.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking back to that moment, Marcus could still recall the way she looked&mdash;vulnerable yet mesmerizing.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If he had been the kind of man to take advantage of a situation, he could have easily had her back then.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera had grown up with little, but that didn't take away from her beauty&mdash;there was something effortlessly sweet and serene about her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Her personality was much the same&mdash;gentle, understanding, the kind of woman who left a lasting impression.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After helping Darian establish Darian Logistics Company, Marcus arranged for Kiera to work there.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But with his packed schedule, he barely had time to check in on the business.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even when he did, their paths never crossed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It had been over three months since he last saw her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>And right now, she was completely surrounded.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Leading the pack was a woman in her forties, dripping in designer labels and enough jewelry to blind someone under the right light. She stood with her hands on her hips, her face twisted with rage. "You little homewrecking tramp! Who the hell do you think you are, coming after my husband? You really think you can pull that off? Whore, you're out of your damn mind!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Kiera could even react, the woman's palm cracked against her face.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The slap landed hard, leaving a glaring red print on her cheek.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Slut," one of the onlookers sneered. "Trying to seduce Mr. Lockwood? You got what was coming to you. Mrs. Lockwood should've beaten you to death!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Seriously, trash like her should be thrown into a strip club and made to work the floors until she learns her place!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The insults came fast and merciless, each one more vicious than the last.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera clutched her burning cheek, her chest heaving, but she refused to drop her gaze.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even outnumbered, she held her ground. "You're wrong. I never came onto your husband&mdash;he's the one who dragged me into his booth and forced me to drink with him!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The woman didn't let her finish. Another slap struck the other side of her face, knocking her off balance. Kiera stumbled, barely catching herself.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You lying whore!" the woman seethed. "You spread your legs for a married man and now you </span><span>wanna</span><span> blame him? You think I'm stupid? Nah, you need a real lesson. And I'll make sure you get one. Get her!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The gang surged forward, fists clenched, ready to tear her apart.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"That's enough!" a voice cut through the commotion.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus had stepped out of his car, moving with quiet but commanding force as he positioned himself in front of Kiera.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The crowd froze, caught off guard. No one expected someone to come to her defense.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera's wide eyes flickered with shock. "Mr. Fitzgerald..."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus turned to her, his fingers brushing against her swollen cheek, his jaw tight. "Tell me exactly what happened," he said, voice low but firm. "And don't worry&mdash;I'll handle this."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From the way the scene had unfolded, Marcus had already pieced together most of what had happened.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But he needed to hear the full story.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At his words, Kiera's composure cracked. Her eyes shimmered with unshed tears as she started to explain.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It had started out as a simple night out. She hadn't seen her friends in over a year, and they convinced her to go to a karaoke bar after dinner to catch up.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Kiera wasn't the type to enjoy loud places like that, but she didn't want to kill the mood.</span></p><div class="pagination">
