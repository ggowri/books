  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila had once thought that the car accident was all part of Marcus' plan, just a way for him to get closer to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, looking back, she realized just how wrong and self-centered she had been.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund and Tina were equally stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had never imagined that this seemingly insignificant young man actually held such a powerful position.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund knew things had gone far beyond simple business dealings. He took a deep breath and turned to Dorian. "</span><span>So</span><span> what you're saying is, Sync Group is definitely not going to pay for the performance, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dorian didn't hesitate, nodding firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Honestly, if it had been up to him alone, he wouldn't have pushed things this far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all operated within the same business circle in Kingston, after all. There were ways to resolve things without burning bridges.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the decision came straight from Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The president had made it clear that everything had to be done according to Marcus' wishes. Dorian wasn't about to cross him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund's eyes narrowed, and his voice grew icy. "Fine. If Sync Group wants to play hardball, then we'll see how this plays out. Mr. Ward, don't forget that we have backing from the Burnett family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sync Group might be an up-and-coming force, but it can't hold a candle to the Burnett family. If you want to push us, I hope you'll think carefully. You might ruin Sync Group's future over this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The threat was clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A murmur ran through the room as people began to realize that Stellar Entertainment was backed by the Burnett family, the same one that was considered one of the four major families in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how powerful Sync Group had become, they were still far below the Burnett family's level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was exactly why Edmund had been so bold in his treatment of the female stars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dorian's face tightened slightly at the mention of the Burnett family, but he quickly glanced at Marcus, as if seeking guidance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, remained calm, exuding quiet confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He turned toward Edmund, his tone cool and steady. "The Burnett family is indeed powerful. But if they decide to pull their investment, do you honestly think your company will survive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund froze for a moment, clearly taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he scoffed, a sarcastic smile tugging at his lips. "The Burnett family saw potential in my company, which is why they invested five years ago. Last year, they upped the ante, pouring three billion into us to build a media base. This year, Stellar Entertainment will generate over five billion in profit for them. You really think the Burnett family would pull out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, many were taken aback by the scale of Stellar Entertainment's operations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Lila, who had once looked down on </span><span>Edmund</span><span>, couldn't help but be surprised at how big the company was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, didn't flinch. His voice remained sharp. "What if I made the Burnett family pull their investment?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund and Tina burst into laughter, their mockery dripping from every word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina placed her hands on her hips, looking at Marcus with disdain. "You think you </span><span>can control Sync Group and now you're trying to make demands of the Burnett family? Who do you think you are? You're way out of your league."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund joined in, smirking. "I'm just here to watch this show. I really want to see how you plan to get the Burnett family to withdraw their investment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And if you can't do that, I'll be sure to report Sync Group's refusal to pay to the Burnett family. Let's see how they respond."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't even look at them. Instead, he calmly pulled out his phone and dialed Maxine's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph, what makes you remember me now?" Maxine's voice came through, laced with annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had been a while since Marcus had called her. With everything going on, they'd barely spoken, just a few messages here and there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had clearly been enough to make Maxine feel neglected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need your help with something," Marcus said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, so you only call when you need something? I see how it is," she replied, her tone more playful than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well..." Marcus sighed, wondering why women always found a reason to complain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, I won't keep you on the line any longer. Just tell me what's going on and how I can help," Maxine continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could tell that Marcus was probably in some real trouble, or else he wouldn't have reached out to her for help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly filled her in on what had transpired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine, equally outraged by Edmund's actions, didn't hesitate for a second and decided to pull her investment from Star Media on the spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he got her confirmation, Marcus hung up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmund, clearly smug, leaned in with a taunting grin. "So, after all that talking, did the Burnett family agree to pull out? Or are you just putting on a show?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina laughed, shaking her head. "Mr. Cross, this guy has no connections to the Burnett family. He's just bluffing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no sooner had she finished speaking than Edmund's phone rang.</span></p><div class="pagination">
