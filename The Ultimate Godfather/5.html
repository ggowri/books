"Go faster..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The irony wasn't lost on him.

I'll call the cops on you for rape!" She yelled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smirked. "Weren't you begging for it earlier? That's not rape, slut. Look at yourself, you loved every second."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tossed his phone in her lap, showing a video of their encounter. The audio clearly captured her screams and desperate pleas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Flushed with anger, she </span><span>snatch</span><span>ed the phone and deleted the video, grinning. "Now, let's see how you escape this!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think that was the only copy?" Marcus laughed and took back his phone. "You're as dumb as your sister."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then he walked out, leaving Natalia alone in the messy bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the wreckage of the sheets and herself, Natalia shook with rage. "You worthless piece of shit! I'll make you pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus was already gone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could </span><span>leave the</span><span> Winchester Villa, Jane appeared in a tight dress, her radiant presence captivating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus," she purred, eyes locked on his. "I saw what you did with Natalia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus</span><span> was stunned for a moment, then his</span><span> eyes roamed over her curves, lingering on her full chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He grabbed her hip playfully. "Want a taste yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane was already worked up from watching them, and his touch only made it worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body betrayed her instantly, getting hot and wet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, she kept her cool. "If you don't want everyone to know about your dirty little secret, be at the VIP suite of Hellton Hotel at eight tonight."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hellton Hotel was owned by </span><span>t</span><span>he Winchester family, and Jane's invitation hinted at something more than just a casual meeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus </span><span>just </span><span>brushed off her suggestion and left, sliding into a sleek white Alphard limousine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today was the day of Golden Group's general manager selection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the new chairman, he had to show.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When did that trash get close to people of this level?"
