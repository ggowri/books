  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked, suddenly becoming interested in the figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right. I come from a land beyond </span><span>Morvalis</span><span>' Ice Wall, an ancient land called Anak. You've probably never heard of it, but that's my home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Ancient Land of Anak?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus felt a jolt of shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time he had ever heard a name from beyond </span><span>Morvalis</span><span>' Ice Wall. His entire being tensed with excitement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly pressed on, "Then why did you come to this world?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The figure sighed. "At first, I only wanted to travel here for a short time. But I underestimated the restrictions of this world. I became trapped and have been unable to return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Over time, I discovered that many others share my fate. They, too, have been sealed in this world, unable to go back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, they started to live as if they belonged here, blending in among the natives."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Marcus couldn't help but tremble slightly in his heart. He continued asking, "What you're saying is that you were sealed here by the constraining force of this world, and you've discovered that there are quite a few others like you in this world, but they can't return, so they have taken on the roles of people from this world. Now, I'm very curious, are there many people like you in this world?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The figure paused, seemingly considering its answer, before saying, "Many. Not just from the Ancient Land of Anak, but from other continents as well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' expression darkened. "Other continents? There are more lands beyond </span><span>Morvalis</span><span>' Ice Wall?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The figure chuckled softly. "Of course. The Ancient Land of Anak is vast, more than ten times the size of this world, but even it is merely a speck in the grand scale of existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the Ancient Land of Anak alone, there are over a trillion beings. And besides humans, countless other races and creatures thrive there. It is a land of infinite wonders."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was once again shaken to his core. From the moment he first encountered </span><span>Morvalis</span><span>' Ice Wall, he had suspected something beyond it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But hearing this firsthand left him utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The world he had known was divided into five continents and four oceans, home to over six billion people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For humanity, it was already an immense and vibrant world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, beyond </span><span>Morvalis</span><span>' Ice Wall, even an "ordinary" continent was more than ten times larger, with a population in the trillions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How vast the real world truly is, Marcus found it hard to imagine, and he didn't dare to think about it any longer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why is this world so small, while the world beyond the Ice Wall is so vast?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the question that burned in his mind the most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After learning about the world beyond </span><span>Morvalis</span><span>' Ice Wall, he increasingly felt that the world he lived in was isolated, and cut off from the real world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus did not know the specific reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing Marcus' question, the figure clearly paused for a moment, then said, "Because this world is a prison of the real world. Only certain forgotten races, some deeply tainted by sin, are exiled here, permanently sealed and imprisoned."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A... prison?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment that word reached his ears, Marcus felt as though his soul had been struck by lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was such a simple word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing it made a strange sense of humiliation rise up within Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even he couldn't explain why.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And yet, that one word had completely overturned everything he thought he knew.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always believed that this world was vast, beautiful, and full of life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As human technology advanced, their quality of life improved, and they even developed the ability to explore space.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To the people of this world, the idea that they lived inside a mere prison was unthinkable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, to the true world, this land was nothing more than a tiny, insignificant cage, one that held forgotten souls, discarded by history.</span></p><div class="pagination">
