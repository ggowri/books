  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girls of the Nuer tribe were different from ordinary girls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were much more open and uninhibited when it came to sex.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Take Princess Nadia, for example. During her "treatments" with Marcus, she experienced intense pleasure, describing it as feeling like she was floating on clouds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A typical girl would never dream of sharing something so intimate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Nadia immediately told Susan, even encouraging her to experience it herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Susan did. During her own session with Marcus, things got heated, and they ended up sleeping together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She, in turn, confessed everything to Nadia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their minds, good things were meant to be shared with those closest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, they had their limits. This was something they kept between themselves, never discussing it with their father or any other men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the recent banquet, both girls had indulged in quite a bit of wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Marcus' departure for the world above the sea just a day away, they were both filled with a deep sense of longing. They decided to seek him out for one last goodbye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as they approached his room, they were met with sounds both embarrassing and exciting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the sounds grew louder, they felt a stirring within themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia bit her lip, her cheeks flushing a deep crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never experienced anything like that sacred connection, and she was filled with curiosity and longing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan's descriptions only intensified that desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sounds drifting from the room amplified her physical reactions, and before she knew it, her hands were exploring her own body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One hand traced the curve of her full, firm breast, while the other slipped down to the secret cleft between her legs, gently rubbing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When her fingers found </span><span>her</span><span> </span><span>most sensitive spot, a sharp, seductive cry escaped Nadia's lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression was utterly rapturous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Susan's mind flashed back to her own passionate encounter with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A familiar emptiness stirred between her own thighs, a burning need rising within her. Like Nadia, she began to rub and caress herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oblivious to everything, Marcus remained absorbed in his passionate encounter with Ada.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, perhaps because of their time apart, their lovemaking lasted an unusually long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>An hour and a half had passed, and Ada had already reached orgasm six times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet Marcus showed no signs of slowing down, his thrusts growing deeper and faster, driving Ada to the edge of consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mind was blank, consumed only by the waves of intense pleasure washing over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their passionate sounds grew louder, further fueling the mounting excitement of Nadia and Susan outside the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the rhythm of their self-pleasuring intensified, both girls simultaneously experienced their first orgasms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their rapturous expressions, coupled with their low moans, created an atmosphere of almost unbearable tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had Marcus been there, he surely would have been overwhelmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Susan," Nadia whispered, still touching herself, "I feel so empty. I want to know what it's like to be with Mr. Fitzgerald. Am I being shameless? Why do I feel this </span><span>way?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Nuer girls were known for their openness about such matters, Nadia was still only eighteen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intensity of her desire for Marcus brought a sense of hesitation, a touch of maidenly reserve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't think like that, Nadia," Susan reassured her. "It's always been said that beautiful women fall for heroes. And Mr. Fitzgerald is a true hero. It's not just us&mdash;any woman in the world would probably be swept off her feet by him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Susan's hands continued to caress her own body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The feeling of pure ecstasy completely consumed them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only after reaching their second climax </span><span>did</span><span> they finally stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost simultaneously, inside the room, Marcus reached his own explosive climax after a particularly intense series of thrusts, releasing everything within Ada.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had reached orgasm nine times, and now she was completely spent, bordering on unconsciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every fiber of her being was saturated with pleasure. It wasn't an exaggeration to say that this encounter surpassed all their previous ones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in her near-unconscious state, Ada could still feel the lingering waves of intense satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Exhausted, Ada quickly fell into a deep sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus took a quick shower and then faintly heard whispering outside the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cautiously, he stepped out of the room and found Nadia and Susan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' sudden appearance startled the girls, making them feel like they'd been caught doing something wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though they had already adjusted their clothing, their faces flushed crimson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you two doing here?" Marcus asked, his gaze sweeping over the girls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia and Susan exchanged a quick glance before replying hastily, "Mr. Fitzgerald, you're leaving tomorrow, and we're... we're going to miss you. We wanted to say one last goodbye. You don't mind, do you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Noticing their uneasy expressions, Marcus sensed something was off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had likely overheard him and Ada earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He decided not to press the issue, simply replying, "Of course not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nadia and Susan looked at each other again, and then Susan spoke, "Well... how about you come back to my room with us, Mr. Fitzgerald? It's where you first arrived in the tribe... Since we don't know when we'll see you again, it feels right to say goodbye where it all began." As she said this, Susan's blue eyes seemed to glisten with unshed tears. The thought of parting with Marcus filled them with sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus agreed readily, following the girls to Susan's room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just as he remembered&mdash;decorated in a medieval style, yet with a distinctly youthful and fresh feel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment he stepped inside, he was met with a delicate, sweet scent that was both refreshing and captivating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything in the room was familiar, almost nostalgic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Susan closed the door behind them and locked it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you lock the door?" Marcus asked casually, a flicker of unease crossing his features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Susan could answer, Nadia wrapped her arms around Marcus' solid frame from behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A look of tender affection blossomed on her beautiful face. "Mr. Fitzgerald," she said, her voice soft, "you saved my life. From the moment you rescued me, I knew I wanted to be yours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that you're leaving, we don't know when we'll see each other again. So... I want to give myself to you. Please, don't refuse me," she pleaded. "Please, Mr. Fitzgerald, grant me this wish." Nadia tilted her face up, her angelic features full of pleading and anticipation.</span></p><div class="pagination">
