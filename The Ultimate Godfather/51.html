  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite Charles pouring the wine with both hands, Marcus remained seated, casually saying, "Mr. Miller, you're too kind. Having Yvonne here with me is more than enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne's expression turned odd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "This guy! Not only is he disrespectful to my father, but he's also downright arrogant. Does he have no shame?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles laughed heartily, "Mr. Fitzgerald, as long as you don't mind!" Just the thought of Marcus being Yvonne's boyfriend filled Charles with glee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly filled everyone's glass, turning to Robert. "Robert, Yvonne has found the perfect partner. Let's enjoy our meal together, and please drop the idea of introducing her to anyone else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert's face darkened immediately. "Charles, what's the meaning of this? Didn't we have an agreement? I invited Mr. Brown here, and now you're going back on your word?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Haley remained silent, his expression was far from pleasant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially when he saw the youthful and stunning Yvonne sitting beside Marcus, a flash of resentment instinctively passed through his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the heir of TreatMed Pharmaceuticals, Haley was never short of women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since he first laid eyes on Yvonne at a business event, she had occupied his thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had originally thought that with Robert's help today, he and Yvonne would surely end up together!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles put on a conciliatory smile. "Robert, don't be angry. This is my fault. I didn't know Yvonne already had a boyfriend! I sincerely apologize."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Charles downed three glasses of wine in quick succession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert's scowl deepened. "Charles, I don't get it. Why would you humble yourself for a poor country man like him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at you, a distinguished professor in internal medicine, fawning over this nobody. What's so special about him? He's nothing compared to Mr. Brown!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Robert, do not insult Mr. Fitzgerald!" Charles's face hardened. "Not only is he Yvonne's boyfriend, but he's also my esteemed guest!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And Mr. Fitzgerald is far from the ordinary man you imagine. If you know his true identity, you'd be full of admiration!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At Charles's reprimand, Robert's face darkened, and he could no longer keep his composure. "Charles, you're really beyond reason. I can't be bothered to argue with you. Since you say this poor guy is of unusual status, why don't you tell me what exactly he does? So I can broaden my horizons."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone at the table perked up, eager to uncover Marcus's identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Yvonne began to feel uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "My father is usually a rational man. If Marcus were really just a nobody, there's no way he'd act this way. Could this infuriating man actually have some extraordinary background?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, that's impossible. How could someone like that be driving a secondhand car and working as a chauffeur? Maybe he's blackmailing my dad somehow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Robert said this, Charles became eager to reveal Marcus's situation at the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus gave Charles a look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles stopped himself just as the words were about to leave his mouth. "Even if I tell you, you won't understand. Suffice it to say, Mr. Fitzgerald's status is beyond comparison to ordinary folks like us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Robert laughed mockingly. "If he's so extraordinary, why can't you say? You're bluffing, Charles!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me make it clear. Mr. Brown is here today, and this marriage will happen, no matter what!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At his words, Haley clapped his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several men in black suits entered, carrying briefcases.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They moved in perfect synchronization, forming a line behind Haley as they opened the cases.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They said, "The gifts from TreatMed Pharmaceuticals are as follows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A pair of antique vases!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A set of crystal goblets!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A chest of pearls!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One hundred million dollars in cash!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Charles, who was accustomed to big occasions, couldn't help but feel dazzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never imagined that Haley would go to such great lengths just to marry Yvonne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, even Charles felt tempted. Emily, on the other hand, was outright ecstatic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but feel that TreatMed Pharmaceuticals truly deserved to be the largest pharmaceutical company in Solomia, as even the gift for a mere meeting was so extravagant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "If Yvonne marries Mr. Brown, just think how much more wealth she'll enjoy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her elegant facade, Emily was unabashedly materialistic. She eagerly began collecting the gifts, her smile stretching from ear to ear. "These are truly generous gifts, Mr. Brown. Yvonne is so fortunate to have caught the eye of someone as exceptional as you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Charles or Yvonne could speak, Emily had already stowed the gifts, brimming with delight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, we can't accept these gifts!" Yvonne protested, her brow furrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she did have a fondness for money, Yvonne wasn't interested in Haley as a person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haley was notorious for being a playboy, spending his days in idleness and indulgence. His behavior was arrogant and domineering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne had no desire to spend her life with someone like that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why not? Marrying into the Brown family is a blessing! It is far better than sticking with that pauper!" Emily held the antique vase with a look of pure satisfaction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their family wasn't exactly poor, but they were worlds apart from the Brown family's fortune.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time Emily had held such treasures in her hands, and the mere thought of owning them filled her with glee.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry. When Yvonne and I get engaged, the gifts will be even grander," Haley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He adjusted his tie, casting a mocking glance at Marcus, his eyes brimming with provocation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, remained unruffled, ignoring Haley entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't agree to this marriage. Take your gifts back," Yvonne said firmly, her face set with determination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Haley furrowed his brows. "We don't take back gifts. Once they're given, they're yours. Yvonne, you're already mine. "Unless someone else can offer something more valuable."</span></p><div class="pagination">
