        <h1>Chapter 581 Life or Death Choice</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, I'll explain to Gina. Please, just go ahead and treat my uncle. I can't stand watching him suffer like this," Catherine said, panic clear in her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded, about to reach for Rodney's arm, when a loud voice cut through the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A guy with no medical qualifications, and he's talking like he's the expert? Get your filthy hands off him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People who had gathered around after Rodney collapsed turned to look towards the entrance of the sales office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of doctors in white coats strode towards them, led by a man in his fifties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wore glasses, exuding an air of authority and confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was Berg Nell, the renowned head of cardiology at </span><span>Solomia</span><span> Second Hospital, the very doctor Gina had mentioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dr. Nell, thank you for coming! Please, you have to save my dad, he's hanging by a thread!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Berg approach, Gina rushed to him, visibly relieved. Her voice quivered with emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dr. Nell's here in person! Looks like these two really have some serious clout!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No kidding! Dr. Nell's one of the top cardiologists in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>. It's a miracle he's here&mdash;he's usually too busy at the clinic to make house calls."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd murmured in admiration. It was clear they held Gina in high regard now that Berg Nell had arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, sweetheart. With me here, your </span><span>dad's</span><span> in good hands," Berg said with complete confidence as he got to work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rodney had been Berg's patient for years. He knew the man's condition like the back of his hand, and had helped him pull through more than once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gina breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Berg had said, her father had faced several life-threatening crises over the years, and it was always Berg who had helped him pull through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least she knew Berg had a handle on her father's condition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Berg wasted no time, pulling out his stethoscope and beginning his examination of Rodney.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His </span><span>aorta's</span><span> completely blocked. We need to act now, or we'll lose him," Marcus said, his voice firm with urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using his X-ray vision, Marcus could see the full extent of Rodney's condition. He </span><span>wasn't going to let this man die if he could help it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Rodney was Catherine's uncle, Marcus felt it was important to speak up. He would've ignored anyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut your mouth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gina snapped, her eyes narrowing dangerously. "What are you going on about? Don't you dare interfere with Dr. Nell's treatment! If my dad dies because of you, I won't forgive you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who the hell is this kid?" Berg raised an eyebrow, clearly unimpressed. "Is he out of his mind, telling me how to do my job?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gina shot Marcus a scornful look and turned back to Berg, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "He's just my cousin's boyfriend. Some clueless guy who thinks he's a doctor. He even said he could treat my dad. Just ignore him, Dr. Nell, and focus on saving my father!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Berg gave a short nod, not even sparing Marcus a second glance, and continued his examination of Rodney.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gina, seriously, you should listen to Marcus," Catherine urged, still desperate. "He really knows his stuff. We're running out of time, I'm worried about Uncle Rodney."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Catherine, stop being so naive. Do you really think he knows anything about medicine?" Gina scoffed. "If I'd known you were dating someone like him, I would've put my foot down. He's a fraud. You need to be careful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine gave a long, helpless sigh. She was about to explain Marcus when suddenly, Rodney gasped for air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes widened, his face turning an awful shade of purple, his breathing erratic and shallow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, what's happening? Please, don't do this to me!" Gina cried out, her voice breaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Gina's worry intensified. She rushed to </span><span>Berg,</span><span> her voice frantic. "Dr. Nell, please, you have to save him. I beg you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Berg's face grew more serious, but he still exuded confidence. "Don't worry. I know this man's condition inside and out. We've got this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Dr. Nell grabbed more medical gear, preparing to take action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But despite his efforts, Rodney's condition continued to worsen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His skin darkened further, his pupils dilating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dr. Nell, his pulse is barely there, it's slowing down," one of the nurses said, her voice filled with panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Berg frowned. "Get the adrenaline, quick. This is the protocol. I saved him like this before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nurse hurriedly grabbed the syringe, preparing to inject the adrenaline.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Adrenaline is just going to speed up his death," Marcus said, his voice calm but firm.</span></p></div>
