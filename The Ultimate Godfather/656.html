        <h1>Chapter 655 I'm Ruined</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson's head buzzed as he listened, his temper exploding. He roared into the phone, his voice cracking with hysteria, "Why? Why are they holding back my five billion? What gives them the right? This is illegal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer on the other end didn't hold back. "If you hadn't swapped out quality goods for fakes, cut corners, and tried to pass off garbage as the real thing, do you think they'd have withheld your payment? Don't forget, the contract you signed explicitly stated that any quality issues would give them the right to hold your deposit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is all on you! Sync Group is worth hundreds of billions. They don't care about your lousy five billion. You pushed them too far!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer's bluntness hit harder than a slap, leaving Jenson speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face turned pale, and his knees buckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He nearly collapsed, saved only by Vivian and Sean rushing forward to hold him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's over. I'm done. Not only have I lost the chance to work with Sync Group, but the payment and deposit are gone! Just like that!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And the bank loans... How the hell am I supposed to pay those off? I'm ruined!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson's voice broke with despair, his eyes empty as if the life had drained out of him. He never in his wildest dreams imagined that Marcus' prediction would come true down to the last word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell into a stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments earlier, Marcus had casually mentioned Jenson wouldn't see a dime of that five billion. Now, here he was, learning the money was gone for good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone started to connect the dots, wondering if Marcus had something to do with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Vivian's arrogance crumbled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman who had been flaunting her wealth just minutes ago now looked like a shadow of herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One moment, she was in paradise. The next, she'd plunged straight into hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Karma," Chad muttered with a grin, the satisfaction practically radiating off him. "Finally, karma."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The frustration he'd been bottling up for so long finally released, and he couldn't remember the last time he felt this good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Vivian wasn't about to take it lying down. "Pathetic loser," she snapped, her voice dripping with venom. "Don't think for a second you're better than us. Even if my husband's lost everything, he'</span><span>s</span><span> still </span><span>way</span><span> above you, you lowly delivery man!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disdain in her voice was palpable, and she wasn't entirely wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even broke, Jenson still owned assets, houses, cars, and luxury items, any one of which could set Chad up for life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Jenson had fallen from grace, the crowd couldn't help but begrudgingly agree with Vivian's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus just chuckled. "You're still not getting it, are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room's attention snapped back to him, curiosity flickering in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus turned to Chad and said, "Sync Group is expanding into the East. Besides their branch in Solomia, they're setting up a sales company to manage product distribution in Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chad, I want you to run it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air went still.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone froze, their brains struggling to process what they'd just heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, what? What does Sync Group's new company have to do with him? Is he implying he's the boss of Sync Group?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's insane. Sync Group is a multi-billion-dollar corporation. No way he's the boss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But let's not kid ourselves. Just because you happened to guess some things about my husband doesn't make you some big-shot CEO."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But let's not kid ourselves. Just because you happened to guess some things about my husband doesn't make you some big-shot CEO.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if Sync Group is expanding, why would they hand a position like that to a loser like Chad? What a joke."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Chad looked uneasy, leaning closer to Marcus. "Marcus, I know you're trying to help me, but isn't this taking it a bit far?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled, giving Chad a reassuring pat on the shoulder before turning to Vivian. "Remember this. I'm not just the boss of Sync Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words hit like a thunderclap, and the crowd couldn't hide their disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' words were becoming downright absurd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way he spoke, it was as if he were the head of an entire business empire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before anyone could react, Marcus raised his hand and snapped his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door swung open, and a group of sharply dressed men strode in, their presence commanding attention.</span></p></div>
