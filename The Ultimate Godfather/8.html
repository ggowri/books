  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail and Felix shared a knowing look before bursting into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who do you think you are? Flashing that Supreme Card around like you own the place. I'm betting that card is stolen," Felix taunted with a sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at the screen! With Mr. Wesley here, the general manager position is mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pointed to the vote tally displayed prominently, his confidence overflowing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if the chairman doesn't want you to be the general manager?" Marcus asked, his tone cold and mocking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail scoffed immediately. "Stop dreaming, Marcus. You're nothing but a loser. What connection could you possibly have to the new chairman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room erupted in mocking laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus straightened his tie and said, "I don't need connections. I am the new chairman."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His quiet words silenced the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes turned to him, filled with disbelief and scorn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail and Felix doubled over laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You? The new chairman? Have you lost your mind? You'd better go to the hospital for a check-up now." Felix wiped tears from his eyes, his tone dripping with mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Yannis, this guy must be delusional after getting hit too hard. This is hilarious!" Abigail cackled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whispers and jeers filled the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Michelle looked uncomfortable, unable to believe Marcus' claim despite not sharing others' contempt for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony puffed on his cigar, watching Marcus with an amused smirk. His disdain was unmistakable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Wesley," Felix bowed slightly, "this man's impersonating the chairman. Should we teach him a lesson? How about breaking a few bones?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anthony waved his hand casually, signaling his approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Anthony's consent, Felix grew even more brazen. He immediately summoned the enforcers from Golden Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A bunch of men dressed in black, armed with baseball bats, surrounded Marcus, ready to attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait! He's a Supreme Card holder anyway- you can't do this to him!" Michelle jumped between them, unwilling to watch Marcus being hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a smack, Felix slapped Michelle hard across the face. Her delicate cheek instantly turned red and swollen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>You s</span><span>tupid </span><span>bitch</span><span>! How dare you defend this fraud? Still take yourself as the daughter of the general manager?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he raised his hand for another strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could touch her, an iron grip caught his wrist. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' glare bore into Felix, his voice icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a firm squeeze, Felix yelped, cursing through clenched teeth. "Let go of me, you worthless piece of shit! Let go, or I'll..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before he could finish, a sharp "crack" echoed through the room. Marcus had broken his wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix screamed in agony, his face twisting in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bastard, you'll pay for this! You're dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing his struggles, Marcus landed several brutal slaps on him. His teeth cracked, blood spraying from his nose and mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, Marcus grabbed him and hurled him across the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Felix crashed into a group of men in black suits, sending them sprawling like bowling pins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd watched in stunned silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could believe this supposed nobody would dare beat Felix to a pulp right in front of Anthony. They thought he had to be insane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him! Kill the bastard!" Felix screamed through bloody lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dozen men charged at Marcus, baseball bats raised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus didn't flinch. His Timeless Warrior's Grimoire might not have been fully mastered, but his body had evolved far beyond normal human limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These thugs were nothing to him and their attacks seemed to crawl through molasses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a few precise strikes, Marcus left them all groaning on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dead silence fell over the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weak nobody they'd mocked had just demolished a dozen armed men without breaking a sweat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle's hand flew to her mouth, eyes wide with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Anthony remained unfazed, casually puffing his cigar. When the whispers died down, he stood and gave a slow clap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impressive," he smirked. "You've got some skills after all."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But don't think you can cause trouble in Golden Group and walk away. Impersonating our chairman? Attacking my men? You'll pay for that today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved lazily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His men soon stepped forward, pistols drawn. Cold steel aimed at Marcus's heart.</span></p><div class="pagination">
