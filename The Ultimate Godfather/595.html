His eyes bore into Marcus as he said through clenched teeth, "I didn't expect you to be so impressive, but you beat up my men, so it's definitely not over today. Just wait and see, and I'll ask Mr. Burton to come and fix you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, Gary waved his hand at his subordinates, and those men got up from the ground with gritted teeth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under Gary's leadership, they left the place in disgrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darian seemed to want to say something, but Marcus waved his hand at him and said, "We can talk about it inside the room."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Marcus took the lead and strode towards the courtyard of the Darian Logistics Company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darian, Ramona, and Kiera exchanged glances and followed after him in succession.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the employees of Darian Logistics Company saw Gary leave with his subordinates, they breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew that with Gary's character, he definitely wouldn't let the matter rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary would surely take more crazy revenge actions, and the Darian Logistics Company would also face a greater crisis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had no idea about the identity of Marcus, who had just arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they had only discussed their competence, the Darian Logistics Company might have failed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind the Rising Logistics Company was Tim, son of the director of the Road Transport Bureau.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furthermore, some people had even heard that Tim's family had extensive connections in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could an ordinary person easily provoke a person like Tim?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, even though Gary left with his subordinates, people only slightly breathed a sigh of relief. They were already mentally prepared for the impending turmoil that would follow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, Gary has Tim behind him. It's all my fault for not preparing enough </span><span>to start the company before, or the Rising Logistics Company wouldn't have targeted us," Darian told Marcus worriedly in the office of the Darian Logistics Company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said calmly, "You have all the formalities, and everything is ready, so of course you want to start the business as soon as possible. What's your fault? It was Gary's fault that he shouldn't have come here to mess with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darian said sadly, "Mr. Fitzgerald, Tim is the son of William Burton, director of the Road Transportation Bureau in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know. With Mr. Fitzgerald's connections, he wouldn't take a director of the Road Transportation Bureau seriously. The last name of Tim's mother is Whitman, and she's a member of the Whitman family in Kingston. I was told she was a cousin of Kent from the Whitman family and that she was prominent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's precisely because of her status that William and Tim have the final say in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although William is just the director of the Road Transportation Bureau, I heard that even the mayor of </span><span>Solomia</span><span> doesn't dare to offend William easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald just beat Gary and his men, so Gary will definitely tell Tim about this. I'm afraid that Mr. Fitzgerald will be at a disadvantage after Tim brings his people here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Darian's words, Ramona, Kiera, and several other managers from the Darian Logistics Company also looked worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, they had heard of the Whitman family in Kingston, which was reputed to be one of the top family powers among the four major families in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Marcus had defeated </span><span>Director Rollins </span><span>and sent him to jail, William's background was not comparable to </span><span>Rollins</span><span>'</span><span>s</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only was Darian worried, but Ramona and Kiera were worried for Marcus as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the Whitman family dares to get involved in this, I won't mind making them pay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just when everyone was worried, Marcus said so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darian and the others were slightly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They didn't expect that Marcus didn't take the Whitman family in Kingston seriously at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Marcus truly possess the power to compete with the Whitman family in Kingston?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To be honest, although Darian, Ramona, and Kiera believed in Marcus and deeply admired him, they didn't think that he had the power to fight the Whitman family in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power that the Whitman family in Kingston could control was simply not comparable to that of people from </span><span>Solomia</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Darian, get out here. And Mr. Fitzgerald, as you mentioned, come out and go to hell!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, a cold voice came from outside the Darian Logistics Company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darian and the others immediately became nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew that Gary might have brought people here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Darian seemed to try to tell Marcus something, but Marcus waved his hand at Darian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Marcus headed out of the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, the courtyard of the Darian Logistics Company was already full of people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary had returned. In addition to those who had been struck to the ground by Marcus earlier, there were a number of new arrivals dressed in the uniforms of the Commerce and Industry Bureau.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside Gary stood a young man of twenty-six or twenty-seven in a suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This young man was Tim, son of William, the director of the Road Transportation Bureau in </span><span>Solomia</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Rising Logistics Company was the industry that William and Tim secretly invested in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within just a few years, they monopolized the logistics business in </span><span>Solomia</span><span> and several small and medium-sized cities around it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, they had an annual turnover of more than ten billion dollars.</span></p><div class="pagination">
