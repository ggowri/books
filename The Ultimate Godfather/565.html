        <h1>Chapter 564 Contraceptive Pills</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus worked his way through a series of positions, each more intense than the last. Finally, with a wild, storm-like thrust, he erupted deep inside Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They both reached their peaks simultaneously, their bodies convulsing in a shared climax.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie was utterly spent, her breath coming in ragged gasps as she lay trembling on the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus rolled off her and sat on the couch, lighting a cigarette and exhaling a cloud of smoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, Josie caught her breath. Sitting up, she glared at him as she surveyed the messy aftermath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You did it again," she snapped. "You promised me you'd be careful. Are you trying to get me pregnant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus rubbed his forehead, a look of frustration crossing his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had made that promise, but lately he couldn't seem to help himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time he finished, he'd feel guilty and swear it wouldn't happen again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, the next time, he'd do it all over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Men, he thought. We're all just slaves to our biology, hardwired to procreate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be more careful next time, I promise," Marcus vowed, his eyes locked on Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie let out a soft chuckle, her rosy cheeks blooming like a flower. "Don't worry, honey. I was just teasing. I've been on the pill to prevent any surprises."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus felt a wave of relief wash over him, but also a pang of concern. "I know birth control pills are supposed to be safe, but Josie, I don't want you taking any unnecessary risks."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie tilted her head up, her eyes meeting his. "It's okay, really. I've heard they're pretty safe and can even regulate your cycle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus nodded, hoping she was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was definitely better than the constant worry of an accidental pregnancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you feeling alright now?" he asked gently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie nodded vigorously. "I'm good, all better. Whenever I'm feeling down, just do that to me. It's like a magic cure."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're unbelievable," Marcus muttered, tapping her lightly on the forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie winked at him, her boldness growing with each passing day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they lay together, Marcus began to feel himself stirring again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pulled her closer, and soon they were lost in the heat of the moment once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was another hour and a half before they finally collapsed, sated and content.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Josie drifted into a deep sleep, Marcus finally entered his cultivation mode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fight with Aquila, the Black Hawk Legion leader, had left its mark on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His injuries weren't minor, and on top of that, absorbing Aquila's energy required intense refinement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus tapped into the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, first healing his wounds until </span><span>they were as good as new, then starting the long process of refining the energy he'd consumed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire process took about five hours. By the time it was over, the energy had fully stabilized and been fully integrated into his system.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Aquila, being a mutant, had shown incredible strength in their fight, but much of that power came from genetic modifications and various performance-enhancing drugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In reality, his base energy was relatively weak, comparable to someone at the Fourth Stage of Ancient Martial Arts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The energy Marcus had absorbed was not only potent but also carried a dangerous toxicity, similar to the corrosive fluid Aquila had spit out during their battle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed to be the very essence of that corrosive liquid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While the refining process was difficult and the benefits minimal, Marcus still made a breakthrough, his cultivation had reached the threshold of the Seventh Stage of Ancient Martial Arts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Reflecting on the battle, Marcus couldn't shake the lingering feeling of unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even now, with his power at the Seventh Stage, he knew he couldn't afford to act recklessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were too many powerful figures hidden in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Take Aquila, for instance&mdash;on the surface, he was just the leader of the Black Hawk Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His individual power seemed to be only on par with someone at the Fourth Stage of Ancient Martial Arts. But with his mutation, his strength had skyrocketed in a short period of time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the Black Hawk Legion? Just a mercenary group. If he were up against someone from a larger, more dangerous organization, Marcus knew their strength would be far more terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, despite his progress, Marcus couldn't afford to become complacent. He needed to grow stronger, faster, if he wanted to survive and keep ahead of the many threats that loomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The friction with his two older brothers was also escalating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew they wouldn't back down easily in the battle for Ryan's inheritance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They'd do whatever it took to eliminate him, and if he didn't keep his guard up, they'd find a way to take him out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only way to stay safe was to grow stronger&mdash;much stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Marcus was lost in thought, his phone buzzed with a new message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was from Blake, the leader of the Axe Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, are you in Kingston? The Axe Gang is under attack by Dragon Tiger Hall. We're in serious danger. We need your help..."</span></p></div>
