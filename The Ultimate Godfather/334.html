  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, however, the sound of a faint vibration rose from Jane's seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden vibration made Jane almost cry out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly covered her mouth and forced herself to endure it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Buzz...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the toy vibrated more and more, which made Jane's body keep swinging. She couldn't resist it and gave out a moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She glared at Marcus ambiguously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus wore an innocent expression while covertly pressing the remote's close button.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it seemed to be out of order. No matter how he pressed it, it didn't work at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the toy was vibrating even worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane couldn't stand it, her lower body secreting a lot of liquid again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana blushed and looked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She secretly thought, "Mr. Fitzgerald is getting bolder. Can't he just have dinner? Why does he have to do that to Jane? I don't want to be tortured like this by him... Come on!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jane... What's wrong with you? I'll get you some medicine!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pearl also saw Jane's strange behavior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she was naive, thinking Jane was ill and wanting to get some medicine for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Pearl's innocent look, Marcus almost laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pearl, no need. Jane is fine. Just have dinner. Don't worry about her..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Buzz...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the constant vibration of the toy, Jane couldn't stand it any longer but ran into the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't back until several minutes later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Obviously, after entering the bathroom, Jane took out the toy and cleaned her private parts before coming back for dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From Jane's point of view, Marcus must have done it deliberately, so she glared at Marcus again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked innocent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The remote control didn't work. It really had nothing to do with him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dinner, Marcus wanted to go back to rest but received a phone call from Maxine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Baby, what can I do for you?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you remember the Black Hawk Legion?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine asked him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, she didn't refuse Marcus to call her baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course I remember, baby."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied, adding the word baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Through our investigation, the main members of the Black Hawk Legion, Abel, Josiah and others, have secretly sneaked into Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To take targeted actions, we are prepared to secretly mobilize the police force and strive not to miss the opportunity to arrest these international criminals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The superior also gave a task of Solomia Special Police Academy and asked our college to send two people as representatives to participate in this arrest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm one of them, and the other should have been Mr. Murphy, but he just had surgery and hasn't fully recovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So I want to invite you to go with me. I wonder if you have time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine explained it to Marcus in detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was still as vigorous and straightforward as ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus liked it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure, baby."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus agreed casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You just agreed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine was a little surprised, but she knew Marcus didn't like to participate in anything that had nothing to do with himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's introduction was so comprehensive because she was afraid that Marcus didn't want to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, baby. I promised you, baby."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus answered it affirmatively again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is your baby, rogue!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine finally reacted to his address.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, you're not my baby. Then, I won't go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine gritted her teeth in anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She ignored his teasing. "Do you have time now? I'll come to you and discuss the details of this operation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. Come on, baby."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, Marcus agreed to everything Maxine requested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hanging up the phone, Marcus simply freshened up and walked out of Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the villa area was a forest, over which he could see the sea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus strolled on the path as the evening air was crisp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, a police jeep stopped in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine got out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She seemed more remarkable after a few days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And her temperament was quite attractive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Next time you call me baby, I'll gag you!" Maxine said to Marcus coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, yes. You did gag me before, and you didn't get my permission."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus grinned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine blushed and suddenly thought of some embarrassing scenes. "I really don't know what's in your mind all day!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, it's boring to joke with you. Just say what you want to discuss with me!" Marcus said.</span></p><div class="pagination">
