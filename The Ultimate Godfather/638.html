        <h1>Chapter 637 Ada's Request</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Millet was terrified, and his gaze changed completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never imagined that the young man before him to be so </span><span>powerful</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strike he had just launched was something that even others of the same realm would find difficult to withstand, yet Marcus took it without batting an eyelid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The strike left him severely injured, yet Marcus remained unscathed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The disparity in their power was plain to see.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Millet finally understood why Ada had desperately tried to stop him from facing off against Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can you be so </span><span>powerful</span><span>?" Millet muttered in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just moments ago, he had considered the possibility that Marcus was someone who had lived through a cycle of samsara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after examining him closely, he realized that Marcus was only in his early twenties.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was not like them. He had lived through a cycle of samsara.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To possess such power at such a young age was hard to imagine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't need to know," Marcus sneered, activating Shadow Step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the blink of an eye, he appeared right in front of Millet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Millet panicked, trying to dodge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' hand gripped his throat. Millet struggled to break free, but it was hopeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the leader of Celestial Arc Order and had reached the minor completion stage of Ancient Martial Stage Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was respected in the world of Ancient Martial Art.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet now, he was being held by a young man like a helpless chick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The humiliation he felt was overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With your meager strength, how dare you provoke me?" Marcus scoffed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the world of Ancient Martial Art, the higher the realm, the slower the rate of advancement, and the greater the gap between the two realms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was only one realm below Marcus, but the difference in their strength was enormous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To Marcus, Millet was no different from an ant. He could easily kill Millet with a casual movement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please, spare him." A melodious voice suddenly echoed from the void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both Millet and Marcus looked over. Ada stepped out from a dense forest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wore a white dress, and her long hair flowed freely in the wind. Her light makeup enhanced her ethereal beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked like an angel who had fallen from the heavens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after seeing her again, Marcus was still amazed by her beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder she had been chosen as the Holy Maiden of Celestial Arc Order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her talent, strength, and appearance were all at the pinnacle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Millet was surprised, but his anger grew even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had sought vengeance for his sect, fighting a bitter battle with the enemy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after being defeated, he now had to rely on Ada to plead for his life. This was a humiliation beyond measure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why should I listen to you?" Marcus sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada bit her lip, seemingly making a difficult decision. "Because I'm your woman. Is that enough?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Millet was shocked. "What? You and he..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly realized what had happened, and the humiliation in his heart deepened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to live, then stop talking," Ada shouted at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the face of overwhelming power, if people wished to survive, they had to abandon certain things like their pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada had already been violated by Marcus and had no pride left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had only been concealing her humiliation to maintain a semblance of face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that's the case, I'll spare his life," Marcus said, loosening his grip and tossing Millet aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sense of humiliation had reached a breaking point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Marcus let go of him, Millet suddenly gathered his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he attacked Marcus with all his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go die!" he shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, he could not bear the humiliation anymore. The death of Colby and the blasphemy against Ada was too much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if it meant death, he was determined to take Marcus down with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Marcus immediately sensed the attack and threw a punch at Millet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force was overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" Ada cried out in alarm. But it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' fist collided with Millet's palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a thunderous explosion, Millet was repelled.</span></p></div>
