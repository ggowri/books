        <h1>Chapter 410 The Fall of the High Priest</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a flick of his hand, the Blood Curse totem grew larger, quickly closing in on Marcus Fitzgerald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As it expanded, everything around him seemed to freeze in place, the air thick with tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, the Curse Weavers grinned maliciously, certain that Marcus was done for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Under my Heavenly Punishment Blood Curse, there's no escape for you. Prepare to die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eden sneered as he poured more sinister energy into the curse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' body was soon enveloped in a dark, malevolent aura that reeked of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But surprisingly, Marcus stood completely still, allowing the curse to come closer without resistance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Celestial Reversal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as the curse was about to strike, Marcus let out a fierce shout and activated the power of Celestial Reversal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In the blink of an eye, the curse that was meant for Marcus was deflected, shooting back toward Eden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Eden could react, the curse engulfed him, its power sinking into his body with lightning speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What... How is this even possible? You... you sent my Heavenly Punishment Blood Curse back at me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eden stammered, his voice laced with disbelief as his body shook uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The other Curse Weavers stared in shock, their faces pale with horror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the curse fully entered his body, Eden's frame shook violently as his life force began to drain away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But as the one who had created the curse, Eden wasn't completely defenseless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Chanting urgently, he activated a secret technique, trying to suppress the curse within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You think that reflecting my curse back at me will defeat me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eden sneered through gritted teeth, attempting to muster the strength for a counterattack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Eden could make a move, Marcus was already standing right in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He placed a firm hand on Eden's shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eden's eyes widened in surprise. Reflexively, he tried to push Marcus' hand away, but it was no use.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same moment, a crushing Devouring Power erupted from Marcus' body, completely enveloping him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eden's body trembled, and he felt his energy being rapidly siphoned away, his strength weakening by the second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His voice faltered as he asked in shock, "What... What kind of technique is this? How are you able to drain my power like this? It's... too evil!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You'll find the answer in hell," Marcus said coldly, his grip tightening as he increased the Devouring Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Eden's body shook even more violently, his energy dissipating at an alarming rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It didn't take long before his eyes glazed over, his life force fading away completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His skin withered, losing all its vitality, and within moments, he turned into a dried-up corpse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sight of their once-revered leader crumbling into nothingness left the remaining Curse Weavers horrified and paralyzed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>These dark sorcerers were known for their malevolent magic, but to see their leader fall in his own domain was beyond their comprehension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Eden's death, Marcus' gaze turned to the remaining Curse Weavers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The few that remained were trembling, their faces now pale with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Your turn."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' voice was cold, his eyes glinting with a trace of greed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of the Curse Weavers tried to make a break for it, but Marcus grabbed him without effort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He quickly unleashed his Devouring Power, and just like the High Priest, the Curse Weaver shriveled into a desiccated corpse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The remaining two Curse Weavers had already managed to flee a considerable distance. Marcus didn't waste time chasing them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a flash, he pulled out a small submachine gun and unleashed a barrage of destructive beams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The beams tore through their bodies, taking them down in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, every enemy in the area had fallen to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've absorbed the High Priest's energy, and his blood is now stored within me. This should be enough to heal Yvonne," Marcus thought to himself as he collected the Spatial Ring from the fallen Curse Weavers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"They're dead... finally, they're all dead. Praise the gods!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A voice came from one of the nearby cages, filled with relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The voice seemed to awaken the others trapped inside, and soon, the cage was filled with cheers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sound reminded Marcus of his next task. He hurried over to the cages, opening each one with haste. "You're free now. You can leave with me!" he called out to the liberated prisoners.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're our savior! We owe you everything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The freed prisoners fell to their knees, tears of gratitude in their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without Marcus' intervention, they would have met the same grisly fate as the corpses scattered across the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus waved them off. "No need for thanks. Just follow me, and we'll get out of here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, he activated the Heavenly Circle Diagram, opening a portal to guide the freed prisoners through. Once they were safe on the other side, Marcus stepped through the portal himself, leaving the cursed space behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the Miller household, Yvonne lay on the bed, her face ashen and drained of life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana stood by, desperately channeling energy into her, but the Blood Curse inside Yvonne was only growing stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yvonne's condition continued to deteriorate, and she was on the verge of death.</span></p></div>
