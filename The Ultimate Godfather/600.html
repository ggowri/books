  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim said to Marcus with a sneer, "You are such a braggart. Who do you think you are? Command the Whitman family? It's so fucking funny. My mother is a member of the Whitman family. How can someone like you expel her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop bragging. If you have the guts, just call right now. If you can't do it, I swear the Whitman family won't let you go. You can never stage a comeback in the rest of your life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary looked at Marcus with a mocking expression, waiting to see Marcus make a fool of himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't say anything and then called Valentin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valentin was so stunned when he received a call from Marcus. He answered the call and talked to Marcus with great respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stated his request, and Valentin naturally agreed without even a pause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim's mother was just a sideline figure. Even if she were an essential figure of the Whitman family, Valentin would expel her from the family. He dared not disobey Marcus' order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Marcus hung up the phone, Tim asked sarcastically, "Who did you call? You're acting pretty well. Is it </span><span>an actor you find</span><span>?" Tim didn't believe that Marcus could contact anyone in the Whitman family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said calmly, "I just called Valentin."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Tim laughed, and his eyes were full of sarcasm when he looked at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim laughed and snorted with disdain, "Do you really think you are qualified to talk to the head of the Whitman family? That's ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary urged Tim, "Mr. Burton, don't talk to this bastard. Just let the Whitman family send someone to kill him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim nodded. He took out his cell phone and was about to call someone when his phone rang. The caller was his father, and Tim answered the call without hesitation. "Hey, Dad, I was just about to call you. What's the matter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up, you brat! What big shot did you offend?" William roared on the other end of the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim was stunned, saying, "Dad, I didn't offend any big shot. I'm just dealing with a nobody."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up! What's the name of the person you are dealing with?" William asked coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim felt that William was very strange today. Ever since he was born, William had always spoken to him gently. William had never talked to him like this. It made Tim feel something was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim immediately told William in detail about what had happened between him and Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William was furious. He yelled, "Damn it! How could I have such a rebellious son like you? Now, kneel and apologize to Mr. Fitzgerald. How dare you offend him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim thought he had heard it wrong. He asked in disbelief, "What did you say, Dad? Why did you ask me to apologize to that jerk?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William shouted hysterically, "Shut up! Listen, Mr. Fitzgerald is a person that even the head of the Whitman family needs to respect. Because you offended Mr. Fitzgerald, your mother has been expelled from the Whitman family. We are doomed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Tim widened his eyes in despair. "How is this possible? It's impossible. This guy is from Solomia. How could he know the head of the Whitman family? No!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tim collapsed on the ground, unable to understand why this had happened. He couldn't believe that his mother had really been expelled from the Whitman family just because of Marcus' one call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as William said, the Burton family was doomed. Without the support of the Whitman family, they could no longer enjoy privileges in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William and Tim had been arrogant and domineering in Solomia over the years. They had offended many people, and their enemies would definitely not let them go this time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Tim felt hopeless and stood up in despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary walked up to Tim and asked, "Mr. Burton, what happened? Will the Whitman family send people to kill this bastard?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fuck you!" After hearing what Gary said, Tim became even angrier. He slapped Gary hard and knocked him to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gary was beaten so badly that he looked at Tim in confusion and asked, "Mr. Burton, why did you hit me? What did I do wrong?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
