        <h1>Chapter 142 Is the Sports Car Yours?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip said, "Though a little drunk, I could still recognize sports cars. I used to love driving, too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas asked, "What brand is that sports car? Did you see it clearly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip replied, "The car logo has two wings. What brand is it? It seems to be an Aston Martin!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas' mind went blank.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was indeed an Aston Martin!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Had it been a sports car of another brand, he would not have had to worry at all.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But didn't Marcus claim that he wanted to buy an Aston Martin?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it really a coincidence?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps a resident or a neighbor's guest happened to buy an Aston Martin.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Thomas realized that the probability was very low.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Aston Martins were not common, and there were probably no more than fifty of them in Solomia. How could it be such a coincidence?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip first glanced at Thomas and asked, "Hey, you look like a rich man. Is the sports car yours?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas was dressed up decently in all branded clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face flushed. He gritted his teeth and shook his head. "Philip, no, mine is a Mercedes-Benz."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He deliberately emphasized the car brand as if to save some face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip was penniless yet arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A disdainful smile immediately spread across his face. "It is just a Mercedes-Benz, not as good as that sports car. Catherine should marry a man with a sports car!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas was embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time, he felt inferior because of his Mercedes-Benz.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, please stop talking. I am just an ordinary friend to them. Don't let your imagination run wild," Catherine hurriedly explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas was just her classmate. As for Marcus, she understood that she didn't deserve him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip ignored her explanation and asked, "Catherine, do you know who the sports car belongs to?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine glanced at Marcus and said, "It should be newly ought by Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was completely convinced of his words during the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bought a villa worth 80 million dollars without hesitation. A mere sports car was definitely affordable for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only someone like Thomas, who looked down on others, was unwilling to believe it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip gazed at Marcus, and his eyes became different. "Hey, you are very amazing. Despite your young age, you have a sports car worth millions of dollars. I agree to marry my daughter to you. As long as you can give me one million dollars, you can get hitched tomorrow!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip was a compulsive gambler who only desired money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For it, he actually planned to sell his own daughter as a commodity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only at that moment that Marcus realized how tragic Catherine's fate was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know how she had managed to live in such a family to this day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could hardly feel the warmth from anyone but Laura.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip's words brought tears to Catherine's eyes, and she was so aggrieved that she wanted to weep.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you crying? You can just cry all day long. You should be happy that I will sell you for a million dollars. If you cry again, I will beat you to death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip had an extremely bad temper and raised his hand to hit Catherine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus grabbed his wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip turned to Marcus, his eyes becoming cold. "You bastard, what does it have to do with you when I beat my daughter? You are so worried about her. Tell me, did you have sex with her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you took her virginity, one million dollars wouldn't be enough. You can't leave here without paying me ten million dollars!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip went further and further. Catherine completely collapsed, tears streaming down her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura had already been traumatized by his long-term domestic violence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her dissatisfaction with him, she didn't dare to say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you go on, I'll teach you a lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't bear it anymore and glared at Philip icily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip looked disdainful and said sarcastically, "Why, you bastard, do you still want to beat me up? You slept with my daughter, and I haven't dealt with you yet. I'm your woman's father. Do you dare to hit me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Philip took advantage of his age and acted like a complete scoundrel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus wished he could beat him up right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the door was kicked open!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several tattooed, burly men rushed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Stanley Dean, in the lead, carried a machete, his eyes cold, and shouted, "Philip, I finally found you. When are you going to pay me back the 300 thousand dollars you owe me for gambling?"</span></p></div>
