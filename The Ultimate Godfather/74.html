  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus left the manor with Natalia on his back, he returned to Kingston and took her on a plane back to Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus felt relieved only after settling Natalia in the Bayside Villa, where Diana was protecting her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We must build up our own power as soon as possible." He secretly made up his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he had too many enemies, and if he was not careful, he would easily make mistakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus did not care, but he did not want to see the people around him implicated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he had killed Leo, the Brown family in Kingston would definitely not let it go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Marcus prepared to go to Kingston as soon as possible to purchase a production line from a pharmaceutical company. As he returned to Solomia, he began to build up his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Returning to Kingston, Marcus went directly to BioFusion Pharmaceuticals, according to the address.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person who received him was a young woman with an elegant temperament and beautiful face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this young woman was Josie Shelman, the president of BioFusion Pharmaceuticals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had heard of her name before. She was a figure on the list of the richest people in Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie was a well-known female private entrepreneur in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just five years, BioFusion Pharmaceuticals, which she founded, became a leading manufacturer of medical equipment in Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Its products were not only popular in the country but also sold well overseas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he saw him today, Marcus was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before this, he always thought that Josie would be an old woman, but he didn't expect her to be so young and beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I heard that you are a senior executive of the Solomia Golden Group. Today I see that you are indeed young, promising and talented." She was tall and looked very capable in her professional attire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her brown and smooth hair was curled into waves, making her even more beautiful and charming. Her every move exuded the unique charm of a working woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Shelman, thank you for your compliment. To make it short, I came here mainly to buy some medical production equipment." Marcus went straight to the point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie showed a charming smile and said, "Almost everyone who comes to me has the same purpose, and you are no exception, Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"May I ask what type of machine you would like to order, Mr. Fitzgerald? We have many options here, and you can choose one first." She handed a product brochure to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had previously made an in-depth study of BioFusion Pharmaceuticals' products.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After just a quick glance, he had a plan in mind. "I want your most advanced production lines, a total of ten, to be delivered within three months. I wonder if your company can meet this requirement."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hint of surprise appeared on Josie's delicate face. "Mr. Fitzgerald, our company's top-end production line is not cheap. One production line costs about 1 billion dollars, and 10 production lines cost 10 billion dollars...In terms of funding..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said firmly, "Ms. Shelman, don't worry about the funds. I can pay the 10 billion dollars in cash in one lump sum."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie looked at Marcus deeply. Most of the people who came to her to order production lines thought that the production lines in other countries were too expensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The price of her top-of-the-line production line was almost the same as those production lines in Weston Land.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never thought that this young man would spend a huge amount of money to order a top-of-the-line production line from her. It really made Josie look at him with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, she reminded him, "In fact, our company can provide personalized optional services. In layman's terms, unimportant links in the production line can be replaced with low-priced machines, which can greatly save costs. Mr. Fitzgerald, if you are willing, I can make a detailed plan for you, which can save at least more than 2 billion dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie's actions also left a very good impression on Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could obviously make more money, but she only cared about the customers. No wonder BioFusion Pharmaceuticals was able to break the foreign monopoly in a short period of time and become the domestic leader. It was indeed different from others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, Josie prepared to customize a plan for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this time, a secretary rushed in and said breathlessly, "Ms. Shelman, it's bad. Mr. Vincent Anderson has had a heart attack and is in the hospital."</span></p><div class="pagination">
