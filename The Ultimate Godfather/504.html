  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied: [Don't worry, tell me about your grandfather's condition first.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My grandfather has always been fond of smoking. A few years ago, he was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. After an operation in Acoton, he seemed to recover quite well," Melina's voice crackled in the message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But a few days ago, his condition suddenly worsened. It seems like he's on the brink... I grew up with my grandfather, and I feel so helpless. Mr. Fitzgerald, could you come to Kingston and stay with me for a while?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina had sent a long voice message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus could hear the tremble in her voice, the unmistakable sound of someone on the verge of tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll book a flight now. I should be there by this afternoon," he responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina didn't know that he had medical knowledge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus was already preparing himself to help treat her grandfather.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a quick breakfast, Marcus booked a flight. By 2:00 PM, the plane landed at Kingston Airport.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given Melina's grandfather, Bowden Thurman, was advanced in age and worsening in condition, his family didn't let him stay at a hospital but hired private doctors to treat him at his manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Marcus got off the plane, Melina, unable to leave, didn't come to meet him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sent a business car to pick him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus got into a luxury car, and after a 40-minute drive, they arrived at Melina's manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Melina's family was only considered a second-tier family in Kingston, as the owner of the Flourish Group, they still owned assets worth over a hundred billion dollars. This manor alone was worth a hundred million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nestled near Violet Mountain Park, the manor had a scenic view, surrounded by mountains and water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The neighboring residents were all prominent figures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you're here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus stepped out of the car, Melina rushed toward him. Two trails of tears slid down her delicate face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked utterly exhausted. Her eyes were swollen and red, with dark circles under them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear she hadn't slept well in a long time, and she had likely been crying for hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How's Sir Thurman?" Marcus asked, his tone gentle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's on his last breath... I feel like he's about to go any minute. My cousin has brought someone from the Celestial Arc Order to try to extend his life. We're hoping he can hold on through today..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina's voice cracked as she spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' gaze darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had heard of the Celestial Arc Order before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was one of the three major sects of the world of Ancient Martial Arts in Uswad, alongside the Astral Serpent Order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this sect had its own distinct beliefs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was surprised that Melina's family had called in someone from the Celestial Arc Order for Bowden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The so-called "life extension" was, in reality, a technique that drained the patient's energy to prolong their life for a brief period.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This method might temporarily make a patient appear more alert, but it often involves burning through their Source Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, even if a patient was near death, they still had a small amount of Source Power left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This Source Power was akin to adrenaline in modern medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It represented the last of the body's potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Theoretically, as long as the Source Power remained, there was a chance of treatment, no matter how severe the illness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, modern science was yet unable to harness this Source Power fully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was why many diseases remained incurable by contemporary medical methods.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What some sects called "life extension" was actually the process of consuming the patient's Source Power, trading a brief period of survival for the eventual loss of all healing potential.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the Source Power was consumed, there was no way to heal the patient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take me to see Sir Thurman. Perhaps I can help him," Marcus said, his voice calm and collected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina's eyes widened in surprise. "Mr. Fitzgerald, you also know medicine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A little," Marcus replied, not elaborating further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Following Melina, Marcus entered a spacious bedroom in the manor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room was easily over a thousand square feet, luxurious and grand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was filled with people at that time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stood around the bed where an elderly man lay.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old man, with white hair and a frail, emaciated body, seemed to have lost consciousness, hanging on by a thread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, several points on his body and his forehead were covered with amulets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nearby, a man in a yellow frock was chanting incantations, performing some sort of ritual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words were incomprehensible, filled with obscure spells, and a bell in his hand chimed with a soft ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A strange force seemed to flow through his palms as if connecting to the amulets on the old man's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gradually, the old man's pale face seemed to regain a hint of color, and his pulse began to stabilize.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's faces reflected a mix of relief and joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Melina, who is this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A tall, elegant woman, whose appearance bore some resemblance to Melina, looked at Marcus and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the woman shared some features with Melina, her expression was sharper, lacking Melina's softness and instead having an air of decisiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was Cloe Thurman, Melina's cousin, the daughter of her uncle, the one Melina had mentioned earlier.</span></p><div class="pagination">
