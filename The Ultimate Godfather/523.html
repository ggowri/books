  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The golden Blade Ray was instantly reflected by Celestial Reversal, hurtling back toward Phoenix with undiminished power. Phoenix's expression twisted in shock&mdash;he hadn't anticipated Marcus' ability to repel his attack. But his reflexes, honed to perfection, far surpassed any opponent Marcus had faced before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a quick sidestep, Phoenix narrowly evaded the rebounding Blade Ray. It grazed past him, slicing a tear through his robes. "Impressive. I didn't expect you to have a skill like this. But such tricks are meaningless against me, "Phoenix sneered, and his voice was icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' face darkened. Since mastering Celestial Reversal, its unpredictability had ensured no opponent could counter it. Yet Phoenix had managed to dodge it with sheer speed and instinct&mdash;a testament to his terrifying strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost immediately, Phoenix unleashed another all-encompassing Hand Strike. Its shadow blotted out the sky as it descended upon Marcus, sealing off every escape route.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus instinctively tried to activate Shadow Step, but an invisible force locked his body in place, rendering him immobile. Left with no other choice, he countered with a blazing Fist Ray. The clash was earth-shattering. The impact sent shockwaves rippling outward, and Marcus felt his blood churn violently within him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew Phoenix was not only his equal in cultivation but also someone whose foundation was far more solid. Bolstered by a myriad of cultivation manuals and techniques, defeating Phoenix would be a monumental challenge&mdash;one that might even end in mutual destruction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with such a stalemate, Marcus knew he needed another plan. The battle raged on, with neither gaining a clear upper hand. The air was saturated with destructive force, the sheer intensity of their clash threatening to tear the very fabric of the battlefield apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're surprisingly young, yet your cultivation rivals mine," Phoenix remarked mid-attack, and his tone was tinged with reluctant admiration. "Under different circumstances, we might have been allies. But now, only one of us will leave this battlefield alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The one who dies will be you!" Marcus shot back with a cold laugh. Though his foundation couldn't match Phoenix's, his diverse arsenal of skills and attacks allowed him to hold his ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Arrogant whelp!" Phoenix's fury boiled over. Eager to end the battle, he unleashed his inner essence, pushing his potential to the limit. Though such a technique strained his physical body, it granted him a short-lived surge in strength, elevating his power to that of a peak Ancient Martial Art Stage Seven expert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This ends now!" Phoenix's voice roared like thunder as he advanced toward Marcus, his oppressive aura forcing the air itself to shudder. Marcus felt the suffocating pressure emanating from Phoenix, a crushing force unlike anything he'd encountered before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems I'll have to use my Devouring Power to bring him down," Marcus thought grimly, preparing to reveal his trump card.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oblivious to Marcus' thoughts, Phoenix's attacks grew even more ferocious. A single Hand Strike, reinforced by ancient runes that glimmered with deadly energy, seemed capable of shattering the heavens themselves. Formation Diagram patterns materialized in the palm of his hand and magnified the power of his strike, elevating it to a fearsome new level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus narrowly evaded it with Shadow Step, reappearing just in time to catch Phoenix's wrist in an iron grip. Phoenix's eyes narrowed, and he instinctively swung the golden scimitar toward Marcus' hand. But Marcus smirked, unleashing Devouring Power in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dark energy enveloped Phoenix, and he froze as if caught in an unyielding grip. A violent tremor shook Phoenix's body as his Numinous Energy began to drain away at an alarming rate. His eyes widened in disbelief, and his voice cracked with shock. "You... you can absorb my power? What kind of monster are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Celestial Reversal had already left Phoenix rattled. Now, the horrifying reality of Marcus' Devouring Power shattered what little composure he had left. In mere seconds, Phoenix felt a third of his energy siphoned away, leaving him pale and panicked. He struggled desperately, but the consuming force was too overwhelming, binding him completely in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helpless, Phoenix could only watch as his strength flowed into Marcus, and his disbelief was etched into his face. The immense energy surge left Marcus' energy channels straining to their limits, as though they might burst at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grinding his teeth, he forced himself to store the stolen Numinous Energy, creating space within his body to endure the influx. But Phoenix's energy was far more potent than expected, the raw intensity threatening to tear Marcus apart from the inside out.</span></p><div class="pagination">
