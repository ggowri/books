  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus finally learned what had happened to Chad after high school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apparently, Chad had gone to college after graduation, ending up at the same university as another classmate of theirs, Jenson Harper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since they were already familiar with each other, their friendship deepened quickly, and they became inseparable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During college, Chad fell in love with a girl who later became his wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But shortly after they got married, he began noticing something off about her relationship with Jenson. Still, he chose to trust his wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until both of Chad's parents were diagnosed with cancer that his wife's true colors emerged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only did she openly admit to having an affair with Jenson, but she also demanded a divorce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outraged, Chad agreed to the divorce. However, he discovered that their joint savings, 500 thousand dollars, which he had planned to use for his parents' treatment, had been transferred entirely to Jenson's account.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The betrayal was too much to bear. Chad was devastated and reported the theft to the police.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But their response crushed him further. The money was considered joint marital property, making it a civil dispute. Even if his wife refused to return the money, there was nothing the police could do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperate, Chad confronted Jenson, but the encounter ended with him being severely beaten, leaving him on the brink of death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without the funds for treatment, Chad's parents passed away, and his life spiraled downhill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He became a shadow of his former self, barely scraping by as a ride-hailing driver and food deliveryman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Chad recounted his story, Marcus could still see the simmering rage in his friend's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson's name was all too familiar to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in high school, Jenson had always been the cocky one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tall, good-looking, and confident, he was the center of attention, especially among the girls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In contrast, Chad, though kind and dependable, lacked Jenson's charm and charisma.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to betray someone as loyal as Chad and to steal his money and crush his family was nothing short of despicable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough about this. Talking about it just brings back bad memories. Let's drink instead!" Chad raised his glass and downed it in one go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus followed suit, his eyes gleaming with resolve. "Chad, have you ever thought about getting even with Jenson?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad let out a bitter laugh, shaking his head. "Get even? How? That guy's living the high life now. I heard he's supplying parts to Sync Group in Kingston, making billions a year. And me? I'm just a broke delivery driver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What am I supposed to do? Fight him with my bare hands? I'm not suicidal!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sync Group?" Marcus' eyes narrowed. So Jenson was making money off one of his companies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, both their phones buzzed with notifications.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a message in their old classmates' group chat, from none other than Jenson himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Hey, everyone! Just got back to Solomia from Kingston. It's been ages since we all met. I miss you guys!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie, with a glamorous profile picture, replied first. [Wow, Jenson! It's been a long time! It's true, though. We haven't had a proper reunion since high school. I've lost touch with so many people.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson chimed back. [Exactly! Why don't we have a get-together? My treat. Tomorrow night, 7 PM, at Golden Hotel. Who's in?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie immediately sent her message to join.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group chat, usually quiet and almost lifeless, suddenly came alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, people only sent the occasional holiday greeting, but Jenson's message changed everything. One by one, classmates started chiming in, eager to join.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew about Jenson's rise to wealth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having such a well-off classmate meant opportunities, and plenty of people were more than happy to cozy up to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This reunion was the perfect chance to make connections. Just one opportunity from Jenson could turn their lives around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at Chad. "Chad, this is your chance. If you want payback, let's go to the reunion tomorrow. I'll back you up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had always been close to Chad back in their school days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing about his friend's miserable experiences filled him with both anger and a strong sense of justice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad, however, quickly waved him off. "Marcus, don't do anything stupid just because of me. Yeah, I hate Jenson, but it's not worth breaking the law. There's no point in ruining your life over someone like him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled. "Do I look like someone who'd do something illegal? Trust me. We're not doing anything reckless. Just follow my lead. Tomorrow, I'll make sure you get the justice you deserve."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You mean it?" Chad asked hesitantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Absolutely."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, both of them responded in the group chat, confirming their attendance at the reunion the next day.</span></p><div class="pagination">
