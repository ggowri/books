        <h1>Chapter 984 Faith's Misery-2</h1>
        <div><p>However, they never expected that this young man was someone even Serpent&#x27;s Coil respected.</p><p>With his status, Aidan couldn&#x27;t easily provoke him. This time, he&#x27;s in serious trouble.</p><p>Hearing this, Aidan and Faith&#x27;s faces instantly turned pale.</p><p>They never expected Marcus to have such a prominent status.</p><p>Especially Faith, she could never have imagined that this man held such a prestigious position.</p><p>If she had known earlier, she wouldn&#x27;t have dared to provoke Marcus.</p><p>Looking at those aggressive Serpent&#x27;s Coil members, Faith&#x27;s mental defenses completely collapsed.</p><p>Her gaze turned to Morgana, and she began to plead softly, &quot;Morgana, my dear daughter, I was wrong before, I shouldn&#x27;t have treated you that way. Please forgive me this time. I apologize to you. I&#x27;m begging you!&quot;</p><p>At this moment, Faith quickly shifted from her previous arrogance to a pitiful appearance.</p><p>Faith was not only shameless but also a great actress.</p><p>People who don&#x27;t know the truth can easily be deceived by her.</p><p>However, Morgana was kind-hearted, and seeing Faith&#x27;s pleading look, she couldn&#x27;t help but waver a little inside.</p><p>But she didn&#x27;t decide to forgive Faith on her own; instead, she turned her gaze to Marcus.</p><p>Marcus clearly understood Morgana&#x27;s thoughts, but he calmly said, &quot;She&#x27;s treated you like this since childhood, and this time, if I didn&#x27;t have enough strength to suppress them, do you think she would have let you go so easily?&quot;</p><p>His words left Morgana in silence, not knowing how to refute for a moment.</p><p>Marcus said, &quot;So, someone like her doesn&#x27;t deserve forgiveness!&quot;</p><p>After speaking, he didn&#x27;t even wait for Morgana to respond and simply waved lightly at Jalen.</p><p>Jalen immediately turned and gave orders to his subordinates.</p><p>These people were all ruthless, and upon receiving Jalen&#x27;s orders, they immediately started beating Aidan and Faith.</p><p>Aidan and Faith cried out in pain, struggling desperately, but it was useless.</p><p>In just a moment, both were beaten bloody.</p><p>Seeing this, fear appeared on the faces of the onlookers.</p><p>Aidan begged for mercy, &quot;Mr. Fitzgerald, I was wrong, truly wrong! Please forgive me this time, I won&#x27;t dare again. It&#x27;s all Faith&#x27;s fault, she made me misunderstand and offend you...&quot;</p><p>Before he finished speaking, he unexpectedly broke free and rushed to Faith, hitting her fiercely.</p><p>The already severely injured Faith became even more miserable.</p><p>Jalen said, &quot;You offended Mr. Fitzgerald, and you still have the nerve to plead with me?&quot;</p><p>Jalen was a smart man and naturally understood that Marcus didn&#x27;t want to forgive Aidan.</p><p>He immediately ordered, &quot;Put this guy in a sack and throw him into the sea!&quot;</p><p>The subordinates quickly obeyed, fetched a huge sack from the business car, and directly covered Aidan with it.</p><p>Aidan pleaded, &quot;Mr. Zafer, please spare me, I really won&#x27;t dare again.&quot;</p><p>Aidan was scared out of his wits and struggled desperately. He knew what being put into a sack meant.</p><p>However, with his strength alone, it was impossible to fight against so many people.</p><p>Soon, he was stuffed into the sack and thrown into the car.</p><p>Seeing this, Aidan&#x27;s subordinates didn&#x27;t dare to speak, fearing that Jalen&#x27;s next target would be them.</p><p>Morgana was also frightened by their brutal methods, her face turning pale.</p><p>She whispered to Marcus, &quot;Are they really going to throw Aidan into the sea?&quot;</p><p>Marcus nodded calmly. &quot;Of course, they wouldn&#x27;t joke about something like this.&quot;</p><p>Hearing this, Morgana&#x27;s body trembled slightly, and her gaze toward Marcus grew more complicated.</p><p>She hadn&#x27;t expected that to vent Marcus&#x27;s anger, the people of Serpent&#x27;s Coil would deal with Aidan so ruthlessly.</p><p>This was enough to prove that Marcus held an extraordinary position in their eyes.</p><p>At this moment, Jalen stepped forward to Marcus, bowed respectfully, and cautiously asked, &quot;Mr. Fitzgerald, do you have any other instructions?&quot;</p><p>Marcus waved his hand casually. &quot;No. Go take care of your own business.&quot;</p><p>Then, Jalen finally dared to leave with his people.</p><p>This scene shocked everyone once again.</p><p>Everyone knew Jalen was the hall master of Serpent&#x27;s Coil, a prominent figure in Solomia&#x27;s underworld.</p><p>But when facing this young man, he acted so humble, as if meeting the president of Serpent&#x27;s Coil.</p><p>Everyone was guessing who Marcus really was.</p></div>
