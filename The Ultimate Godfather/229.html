Go back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This matter was not the fault of the Axe Gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the underground world, people often took on missions just to make money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was to maintain the normal operation of the gang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The followers had no right to decide what kind of missions to take.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the Axe Gang members heard this, they felt as if they had been pardoned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After thanking Marcus, they left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene made Donald look at Marcus deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Judging from the Axe Gang's attitude towards Marcus, he knew it was not because the other party knew the Burnett family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was worship from the heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This showed that everyone in the Axe Gang already knew Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Donald admire Marcus even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, another group of people walked into the sales office, led by a tall girl with delicate features.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's the eldest daughter of the Flourish Group, Melina!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Melina is so beautiful and has a great figure. She is truly an international supermodel! And I heard that she is studying at Kingston University and will probably inherit the Flourish Group in the future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a discussion was heard among the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina was followed by several senior executives of the Flourish Group, and they all appeared to be very respectful in front of Melina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina came over and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young female salesperson who had helped Marcus and Josie introduce the villa briefly told Melina what had happened before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina frowned and realized that the person who wanted to buy the villa was Marcus. She immediately went up to greet him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The look she gave Marcus was full of admiration and appreciation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If without Marcus' help, she might have been raped by Troy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, Marcus behaved well that day, so Melina still couldn't forget him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She even wanted to find an opportunity to be alone with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, we meet again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina was the first to greet Marcus with a sweet smile. She looked shy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like meeting her lover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was stunned again. They didn't expect that Marcus also knew the eldest daughter of the Flourish Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And looking at Melina's expression, it seemed that she admired Marcus very much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was the identity of Marcus and how come he had such extensive connections?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was incredible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a coincidence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled and nodded to Melina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is an honor for us that you have chosen our villa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina smiled elegantly, and her eyes inadvertently fell on Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked slightly surprised and naturally recognized Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't expect that Josie was also related to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Melina turned her head and looked at the sales manager. Her expression immediately turned cold, and she said, "You are just a sales manager, how dare you treat clients differently here? Who gave you the courage?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sales manager was frightened and turned pale. She hurriedly explained, "I didn't know that Mr. Fitzgerald was of noble status. Please forgive me this time. I know I was wrong!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sales manager had a sad face, and her heart was full of regret. It was not easy for her to become a manager.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It looked like she was over for today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have always been fair and just, and we treat all customers with courtesy, but you have violated the group's sales taboo. You are no longer suitable for this job. You are fired, and the finance department will settle your salary later!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina said this with a cold face, looking dominating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sales manager looked completely desperate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never expected that because of her underestimation, she would ruin her bright future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can I buy a villa this time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked Melina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina smiled elegantly and said, "Of course!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she introduced Marcus personally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the eldest daughter of the Flourish Group, Melina's authority was naturally not comparable to that of an ordinary salesperson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her introduction, Marcus bought a villa with a better location for Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This villa was not only large in area, but also located in the core area of the entire community, surrounded by mountains and water, and was the king of buildings in the entire community.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Melina also gave Marcus a discount. The original price was 200 million dollars, but Melina only charged 100 million dollars, which was the cost price.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus did not refuse. There was no need to be too polite about some things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Melina asked him for help in the future, he would lend a helping hand without hesitation.</span></p><div class="pagination">
