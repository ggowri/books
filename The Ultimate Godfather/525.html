  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recently, Patrick had been relentlessly pursuing Natalia, only to be met with repeated rejection. This filled him with fury, but he also realized there was little hope left for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coincidentally, Isaac from the Griffin family of Crankhurst had taken an interest in Natalia. Seeing an opportunity, Patrick decided to curry favor with Isaac by introducing Natalia to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason was simple. Isaac, much like Terry, was a direct descendant of the Griffin family. In Crankhurst, his status was of immense importance, and he even had close ties to Black Dragon Society, the infamous Crankhurst ninja organization.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite considering himself distinguished, Patrick was merely a branch member of the declining Whitman family. He figured aligning with Isaac might benefit him. Perhaps after Isaac was done with Natalia, she'd be passed down to him for his own amusement. Patrick never saw Natalia as a woman worth marrying, so who toyed with her didn't matter as long as he got his turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't care who he is&mdash;it has nothing to do with me. Step aside now, or don't blame me for what happens next." Natalia's expression turned fierce, and her eyes were cold with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bitch! Do you think you're too good for me?" Patrick's face twisted with rage. "I've already heard about you and your so-called brother-in-law. You've probably slept with him, haven't you? And now you're here pretending to be pure? You're such a..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Patrick finish</span><span>ed</span><span>, he raised his hand to strike Natalia. However, a large hand suddenly grabbed his wrist in mid-air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick's eyes narrowed as he instinctively turned to Marcus. Grinding his teeth, he spat, "Who the hell are you? Trying to play the hero? I'll warn you to stay out of this. I'm from the Whitman family in Kingston, and these two are from Crankhurst's Griffin family. You can't afford to mess with us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't bother responding and kicked Patrick in the stomach. Patrick let out a pained cry as he doubled over, clutching his abdomen in agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, is it really you?" Natalia finally snapped out of her shock, and her eyes li</span><span>t</span><span> up with delight as she looked at Marcus. She hadn't expected him to appear at such a crucial moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who else would it be, silly girl?" Marcus gently ruffled Natalia's hair, and his expression was full of affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Patrick, recovering slightly from the pain, glared at Marcus with venom. "So, you're Marcus, huh? How dare you lay a hand on me. Do you have any idea who I am? I'm from the Whitman family in Kingston, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Patrick could finish, Marcus slapped him across the face. Patrick was sent sprawling to the ground, and several teeth flew from his mouth as blood trickled out. He howled in pain, clutching his swollen cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Say one more filthy word, and I'll make sure you regret it," Marcus said coldly, and his gaze was</span><span> </span><span>sharp and menacing. Natalia was his bottom line, and Patrick had clearly crossed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're from Uswad. Do you think you can just hit people on campus? Don't you think you're being a little too arrogant?" A haughty voice interrupted. It was Isaac who finally stepped forward. As a direct descendant of the Griffin family, he considered himself above reproach. In his eyes, Uswadian people should be honored by his presence, not the other way around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The commotion quickly drew a crowd of students.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Holy crap, is that Patrick? He actually got beaten up like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, and Patrick is from the Whitman family in Kingston. Even if the Whitman family's been in decline, they're still no joke. Whoever did this is in big trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does anyone know who that guy is? I've never seen him before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoever he is, he's screwed. Just wait until the Whitman family makes their move."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As whispers spread among the students, Marcus paid no attention. He locked eyes with Isaac, and his voice was calm but cutting. "What? Do you want to end up like him? I'd be happy to oblige."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isaac's face darkened at the blatant provocation. "Are you declaring war on me?" His voice dripped with arrogance. The Griffin family had been practicing karate for generations. While Isaac wasn't as skilled as Easton himself, he was a black belt of the seventh degree&mdash;a level ordinary people couldn't hope to match.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone like you isn't even worth the effort," Marcus scoffed, and his tone dripped with disdain. "Natalia, let's go." He took Natalia's hand, ready to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring someone was the ultimate form of humiliation. This blatant disregard enraged Isaac to the core. With a furious roar, he charged at Marcus, throwing a powerful strike aimed directly at him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
