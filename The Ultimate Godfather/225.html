  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young saleswoman was stunned and said to the manager with an unpleasant expression, "This couple has just decided to buy this villa, and I am just about to handle the formalities for them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sales manager looked gloomy and said, "Didn't you hear me? Mr. White and his wife want to buy this villa, and we won't sell it to anyone else!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young female salesperson felt a little aggrieved. She had finally sold a house, but her sales performance was about to be snatched away by the sales manager.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sales manager was a domineering person. She relied on her power to do whatever she wanted in the sales office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Similar things happened from time to time. Except for this young female salesperson, all other salespeople had their performance snatched away by this sales manager, and they dared not say anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sir and Madam, I'm so sorry. This villa has been bought by someone else, so I can't process the formalities for you two."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus frowned. From the sales manager's attitude, he could tell that Mr. White and his wife must have extraordinary identities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sales manager flattered Kevin and his wife, "Mr. White, we will not sell this villa to anyone else except you, and we can give you a 20 percent discount. What do you think?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin wore gold-rimmed glasses and looked quite knowledgeable, but his wife looked mean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing the sales manager's words, the couple's expressions became arrogant, and they glanced at Marcus and Josie with provocative eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let's do as you said."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin took out a bank card and handed it to the sales manager.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His name was Kevin White, and he was the general manager of the Burnett Group in Kingston. His immediate superior was Donald, whom Marcus had met before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a senior executive of the Burnett family's industries in Kingston, Kevin had always been arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter where he went, he would be given special care for the sake of the Burnett family in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Flourish Manor made him feel an unprecedented sense of superiority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, Kevin seemed to recognize Josie and said with a smile, "Isn't this Ms. Shelman, the outstanding female entrepreneur in Kingston?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't expect that you also came here to buy a villa. Unfortunately, you and I have our eyes on the same villa, so you will naturally lose the qualification to buy this villa..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin was very mean.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was hard to imagine how such a person could become an industry executive of the Burnett Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie looked a little gloomy. Even though she was a very well-mannered woman, she couldn't help but want to beat Kevin up at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Mr. White hadn't told me, I wouldn't have recognized this lady to be Ms. Shelman from </span><span>BioFusion</span><span> Pharmaceuticals. I've heard about Ms. Shelman's deeds a long time ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Shelman is indeed very famous in Kingston, but she is nothing compared to Mr. White. Mr. White, please wait a moment. I will handle the purchase procedures for you now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sales manager said with a smile, and before she finished speaking, she prepared to go to the front desk to get the contract.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait a minute!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Marcus disliked the most was unfairness, and he especially didn't like it when it happened to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sales manager was stunned, looked at Marcus, and asked, "What's the matter, sir?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the manager addressed Marcus respectfully, everyone could see the disdainful look of the manager.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I bought it first. Don't you understand this principle?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus spoke with a cold face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sales manager was stunned for a moment, then smiled sarcastically, "I explained it very clearly. Although you were the first to choose the villa, Mr. White is a more distinguished guest of our sales office, so we decided to sell this villa to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't tell me that your status is more noble than Mr. White's!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she said this, she immediately attracted the attention of many people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This included several other female salespeople.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all stopped working and walked over. A tall saleswoman with curly hair laughed sarcastically and said, "Are you kidding? This guy doesn't look like a local. He's probably a country bumpkin from out of town."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't expect Ms. Shelman to have such a bad taste to like this kind of man. It's ridiculous!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, a bumpkin from the countryside pretends to be a rich man and even dares to compare his status with Mr. White. Who does he think he is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another female salesperson agreed, flattering Kevin.</span></p><div class="pagination">
