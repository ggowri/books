  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus furrowed his brow as he read the message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly typed a reply. "Why would Dragon Tiger Hall suddenly be hunting down the Axe Gang? Is there someone pulling the strings behind the scenes?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake's response came fast. "I don't know for sure, but they've suddenly got a bunch of Ancient Martial Artists in their ranks, and each one of them is more dangerous than </span><span>the last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not just us&mdash;the whole damn city's getting torn apart. Every other gang in Kingston is getting hit, and most of them have already folded, swearing allegiance to Dragon Tiger Hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's like they're trying to take over the entire underground scene here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've already taken heavy losses. Without backup, we're </span><span>gonna</span><span> be wiped out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice message ended, but Marcus could still hear the chaos in the background&mdash;gunfire, shouting, the sound of a battle spiraling out of control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Axe Gang had pledged loyalty to him two months ago, becoming the first gang he'd brought under his control in Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they were in trouble, he couldn't just stand by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span> <span>Marcus</span><span>, if you need to go, don't worry about me. I'm good to go, for real," Josie said, her voice steady but warm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus kissed her forehead, his lips lingering for a moment. "Stay safe."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, he headed out, catching a cab straight to the Axe Gang's headquarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before this, Marcus had never considered disrupting the delicate balance of Kingston's underground world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, with the Axe Gang being relentlessly hunted down by Dragon Tiger Hall, that thought was becoming harder to ignore. It was starting to burn in his chest like wildfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Axe Gang's headquarters was located on the outskirts of Kingston, sprawling across a vast plot of land, packed with everything a criminal operation could need.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus' cab drove through the area, the smoke and flames in the distance were impossible to miss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The night sky was lit up by the inferno raging from the gang's compound, and the sound of gunfire rang out through the air, echoing the intensity of a brutal firefight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His brow furrowed, a sense of anger rising within him. This was no longer just a turf war. Something deeper was at play.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had the driver pull over to the side of the road. Without waiting, Marcus stepped out and walked briskly toward the Axe Gang's gates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he reached the compound, the sight before him was nothing short of chaotic. The ground was littered with bodies, blood pooling everywhere. It was a massacre.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Blake, Baron, and a few of the higher-ups were still standing, but barely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were badly wounded, struggling to hold on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Across from them stood Dragon Tiger Hall's forces, their camp reinforced by several intimidating figures&mdash;each of them radiating power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the head of the group was a Stage Five Ancient Martial Artist, with a few others who were no less formidable, all at least Stage Three.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The contrast was brutal. On one side, the Axe Gang&mdash;mostly just regular guys armed with heavy weapons&mdash;had been holding their ground through sheer force, but they were no match for the overwhelming onslaught from Dragon Tiger Hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were running on empty, and their numbers were rapidly dwindling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blake," came a voice from the enemy camp, smooth and almost mocking. "I suggest </span><span>you kneel and submit now. This is a representative of the Celestial Arc </span><span>Order,</span><span> someone no mere mortal can hope to defeat. The Celestial Arc Order is an elite faction under Mr. Roger Gellar in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not just surrendering to Dragon Tiger Hall. You're joining Mr. Gellar's ranks. If you do, the Axe Gang might survive. If not... well, it's the end of the road for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luther's voice was loud and condescending, a clear display of superiority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake and Baron, drenched in blood and barely standing, exchanged a grim look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blake, his voice raw and defiant, spat out, "We're under Mr. Fitzgerald's protection. Ever since we swore loyalty to him, we've been treated like family. The Axe Gang wouldn't be standing today without Mr. Fitzgerald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Luther, you want us to bend the knee? Dream on. And I'll tell you this straight&mdash;Mr. Fitzgerald is on his way. When he gets here, it'll be your turn to kneel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Blake spoke those words, a deep sense of uncertainty gnawed at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Celestial Arc Order was one of the three most powerful Ancient Martial Arts factions in </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, known for its strength and its close ties to Mr. Roger Gellar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man they had sent&mdash;a Stage Five Ancient Martial Artist&mdash;was an overwhelming force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though Blake had seen </span><span>Marcus</span><span> fight, even he wondered if Marcus stood a chance against someone like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only reason Blake refused to surrender was pride. He couldn't bear to crawl like a coward, especially after Marcus had placed his trust in the Axe Gang. He wouldn't let Marcus down, no matter what.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luther scoffed, his voice dripping with mockery. "Ha, Blake, you really are stubborn as hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You seriously think that Mr. Fitzgerald&mdash;whoever the hell he is&mdash;has any chance against Derek? That's rich."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luther's laughter was bitter, the words cutting deep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek wasn't just any powerful figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a revered elder in the Celestial Arc Order, his strength at Stage Five making him almost godlike in the eyes of ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his help, Dragon Tiger Hall had swept through Kingston's underground world in just three days, wiping out over a hundred gangs. They were on the verge of taking full control of the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, this idiot Blake had the nerve to mention Marcus in front of someone like him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was laughable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Enough talk," Derek said coldly, his voice carrying the weight of finality. "I'll end this now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luther immediately stepped back, bowing his head respectfully and clearing a path for Derek to move forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derek's voice was a lethal whisper as he took slow, deliberate steps toward the remaining Axe Gang members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a single, fluid motion, he reached out and seized one of the higher-ups by the </span><span>throat, his grip like iron, crushing the man's windpipe without a second thought.</span></p><div class="pagination">
