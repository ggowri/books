  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Jenson spoke, Natalie's face instantly betrayed her shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she had suspected, Jenson was far wealthier than Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Jenson still seemed to treat Vivian well, leaving little room for her to step in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian, meanwhile, was brimming with pride. She folded her arms and sneered at Chad. "Chad, do you really think bringing a rich friend here is enough to save face?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me tell you, your friend's wealth is nothing compared to my husband's. And even if he's rich, that money isn't yours. What are you showing off for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smirked arrogantly, her posture oozing confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson chimed in with a mocking tone, his expression dripping with smugness. "Exactly. He's just a delivery driver. How much perspective can he possibly have? His world is as small as his paycheck. There's no way he could understand the life of the wealthy like us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad clenched his fists tightly, anger boiling within him with nowhere to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jenson, Natalie, Marcus, Chad. Is that you guys?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a few figures approached from the parking lot. It was some of their high school classmates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The dim lighting made them hesitant to confirm who was who.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie quickly waved. "Yeah, it's us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's been so long! You all look just the same. I heard from the group chat a lot of people are already here. Let's head up so we're not the last ones," one of them said, smiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, his gaze lingered on Jenson, a hint of envy flashing in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson's wealth was practically legendary among their old classmates. Everyone envied him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vivian, let's not waste any more time with the delivery boy. Come on, I'll take you upstairs," Jenson said, holding out his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian happily took it, and the two of them strolled toward the grand entrance of Golden Hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie glanced at Marcus and decided to follow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, look at Jenson's wife. She's stunning! That dress is so classy. He's got great taste."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Careful what you say. I heard she used to be Chad's wife. The three of them were college classmates. Chad married her first, but then she left him for Jenson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way. Poor Chad... That's brutal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it sucks. That's what happens when a guy doesn't have money. He can't even keep his own wife. Now he has to watch her cling to someone else's arm, looking so happy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Jenson and Vivian disappeared into the hotel, a group of male classmates whispered among themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chad's face darkened, his fury boiling over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come on, Chad. Let's head up too," Marcus said, his voice calm but with a hint of steel. He could see the storm brewing in Chad's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, Marcus. Let's just leave. If I go up there, all I'll see is those two rubbing their happiness in my face. I can't stand it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chad, you have to keep your cool. Let them gloat while they can. The higher they fly, the harder they'll fall later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' voice was steady, but his resolve was unwavering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, he was determined to make this shameless couple taste humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of silence, Chad nodded, and the two of them headed into the luxurious Golden Hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lobby was breathtaking, glittering with gold and radiating opulence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Golden Hotel was a crown jewel of Golden Group, famously the most extravagant spot in the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many of their classmates, who had come from modest backgrounds, were in awe of the grandeur, their eyes wide with amazement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For most, opportunities to visit such a high-end establishment were rare.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In one of the expansive private dining rooms, the classmates gathered one by one until everyone had arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson poured himself a glass of wine and stood up with a confident smile. "I'm the organizer of today's reunion. And, not to brag, but I think I can safely say I'm the most successful among us now. So tonight, everything's on me! Order whatever you like. Don't hold back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He downed the wine in one go, his demeanor full of swagger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vivian's eyes sparkled with admiration.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt more certain than ever that leaving Chad for Jenson had been the right choice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her husband had built a business empire worth billions in just a few years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Compared to Chad, who was nothing but a useless loser, Jenson was in a league of his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson made the rounds, greeting classmates one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Years of business dealings had clearly sharpened his social skills and his drinking tolerance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he reached Chad, Jenson took a deliberate step back, his nose wrinkling in mock disgust. "What's that smell?" he asked loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A classmate nearby looked puzzled. "What smell? I don't smell anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jenson smirked. "It's the stench of poverty. Can't you smell it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room burst into laughter as everyone caught on to his insult.</span></p><div class="pagination">
