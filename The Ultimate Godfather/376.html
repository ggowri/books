What a bunch of waste!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Roger released an extremely strong coercion and instantly enveloped the entire headquarters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Click...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some glass containers in the headquarters were broken under that coercion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man who came to report had a cold sweat on his forehead, and his face was extremely pale. He fell to his knees directly in front of Roger, saying, "Mr. Roger Gellar, the Black Hawk Legion dispatched many of the most advanced cyborgs in Acoton. Even the two leaders, Abel and Josiah failed and were wiped out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just because Uswad sent a young man with the ability of a warrior."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While saying that, he took out his mobile phone and showed Marcus' battle scenes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Damn it, it's him again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this figure, Roger suddenly burst into a strong hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Roger Gellar, who is this man?" the sexy beauty asked some curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's my brother I've never met before!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger gnashed his teeth and said, "My godfather has appointed him as his heir, and Marcus has grown rapidly recently.

"He is the heir appointed by the godfather. If I kill him myself, the godfather will never let me go!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I can only secretly attack him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The woman naturally knew what he meant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryan, as the most powerful man in the world, naturally didn't want his children to just kill each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially Marcus was his handpicked heir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the energy controlled by Roger now, it was not enough to do things against the wishes of Ryan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a night of practice, Marcus finally reached Stage Four of Being a Wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made his magic power more powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using the magics at will could pose a threat to people with Ancient Martial Stage Four.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In addition, the skills of Frostbind and Stormcall had also improved at the same time, which was almost equivalent to Stage Two of Wizard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Marcus received a phone call from Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, are you busy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace's soft and weak voice came from the other end of the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's time to dredge the second energy channels for me today.

He didn't feel good to go to Benjamin's house either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just that he couldn't offer to go to the hotel. After all, Grace was a girl, and he was afraid of her misunderstanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two agreed to meet at the Hilton Hotel in Solomia at ten o'clock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus just arrived and received Grace's message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had already arrived and opened the room in advance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took the elevator upstairs and knocked on the door. The door was opened, revealing her beautiful face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had already taken off her clothes, and her thin charming body was wrapped in a white bath towel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, come in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She blushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus closed the door sat on the sofa and lit a cigarette to smoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Garce's innocent face, he felt his lower abdomen was faintly hot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly suppressed the evil thoughts in his heart</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he reached Ancient Martial Stage Five, he had found that his desire was getting stronger and stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he couldn't control himself well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A girl like Grace stripped naked and appeared in front of him.

Why are you still staring at me? I'm so shy..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace quietly covered her red face and turned her body over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't beauty for appreciation?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While speaking, he came behind Grace.</span></p><div class="pagination">
