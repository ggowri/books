        <h1>Chapter 289 The Devouring Power Showing Its Might!</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus remained silent, unwilling to reveal anything to Asher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After repelling the attack, the restraints of the Four Symbols Circle were shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without hesitation, Marcus unleashed his Lightning and Fireball magic, launching relentless long-range assaults on Asher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While these magical attacks couldn't directly threaten Asher's life, they effectively sapped his energy and gradually wore him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher's expression soured as he dodged the magical attacks and exclaimed, "I never imagined your magical prowess had reached such heights. I clearly underestimated you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thunder and flames filled the air as he continued to evade Marcus' onslaught, inching closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"There are too many things you don't know. Don't talk nonsense with me. Come and destroy me if you can!" Marcus taunted, sensing Asher's injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Do you really think I can't handle you?" Asher scoffed, swiftly retrieving a pill from his Spatial Ring and swallowing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In an instant, a surge of power radiated from him and restored his aura to its peak even enhancing it slightly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He seemed to grow taller and excluded a terrifying pressure that filled Marcus with despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Burning Blood!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus realized Asher was using a technique to overdraw his potential for a temporary boost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher used this pill to return to his peak temporarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though this came at a significant personal cost, Asher was determined to kill Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Dong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With a thunderous step, the ground shook, sending shockwaves through Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>How did he know this move?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Celestial Reversal, he thought Asher was seriously injured and he could have a break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It never occurred to him that Asher's willingness to overdraw his strength to kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Now Asher was even stronger than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Once again, Marcus was at an absolute disadvantage and didn't know how to deal with the next crazy and fierce offensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're the first to make me kill at the expense of burning blood!" Asher declared coldly, lunging forward with a powerful palm strike.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Caught off guard, Marcus could only muster a feeble defense that sent him flying and spitting blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If not for the healing properties of the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, he would have surely perished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'll tear you apart!" Asher threatened, closing in on Marcus and grabbing him by the neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despair washed over Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He thought he was about to die here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Asher could act further, a supreme Devouring Power erupted from Marcus, enveloping Asher.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher froze, unable to react as the terrifying energy invaded his body, rapidly consuming his internal power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His energy surged into Marcus, filling his meridians to the brink and igniting an intense burning sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Asher's face paled as he trembled, desperately running his cultivation manuals to break free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gritted his teeth and raised his left hand to strike Marcus, but he was powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Devouring Power intensified, greedily siphoning his energy and even his bloodline into Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What kind of evil energy is this?" Asher demanded, frustration evident on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus trembled, surprised that the Devouring Power he had just acquired was now acting on its own.</span></p></div>
