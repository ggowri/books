  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The commotion quickly drew the attention of several other interviewers, who turned their gazes toward the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Rural bumpkin, who do you think you are, questioning my aunt's decision?" Gloria snapped at Marcus, her tone sharp and disdainful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She crossed her arms arrogantly, standing tall with a smug look on her face. "My uncle is the General Manager of the Sync Group Solomia branch. You can ask Catherine&mdash;do you really think she stands a chance competing with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine bit her lip, feeling a wave of humiliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her family had always struggled, and with both parents relying on her, she gathered all her courage to speak up. "Even if your uncle is the General Manager, the rules should still apply," she said, trying to keep her voice steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First of all, there's a system. I've been in line, and I should be the one going first for the interview. Also, in terms of qualifications and work experience, I'm far more qualified than you. Why should you get hired right away?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine had learned from her past experiences, particularly what happened at the Cedars Villas sales office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She realized that sometimes being "good" or "nice" wasn't enough in this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she hadn't had Marcus' help back then, she would've lost the commission worth a hundred thousand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? Catherine, looks like you've developed some backbone over the years," Gloria taunted, her tone mocking. "Did you forget how terrified you were of me back in school? Don't think that just because you're in the real world now, you can talk back to me. Let me tell you, as long as I'm here, you won't be getting into Sync Group!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing these words, Catherine felt a pang of anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the pretenses of friendship they had shared in school were gone now. Gloria's true colors had finally emerged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring Gloria's words, Catherine turned to Victoria and said calmly, "At the Sync Group recruitment event, does it really come down to who you know, and not your qualifications or work experience?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The room fell silent for a moment, before a murmur of agreement spread through the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine's words had struck a nerve with many of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After years of studying and working hard to get into a prestigious university, they had hoped that their credentials would be enough to land a decent job.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, they found themselves up against a system that seemed to favor connections over merit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the whispers spread, Victoria's expression hardened slightly, but she quickly regained her composure. "Since you're so keen to talk about qualifications, let me ask you&mdash;what exactly is your educational background, and what work experience do you have?" she asked, her tone cold but controlled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, Gloria's face darkened. She quickly stepped over to Victoria's side and whispered something in her ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victoria's eyes flicked to the side, and before Catherine could respond, she addressed the crowd loudly. "I don't know if any graduates from Solomia Information University are present today, but I'm making an announcement: all graduates from Solomia Information University can leave. We are not hiring from that school."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her announcement sent shockwaves through the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was clear to everyone what was happening. Victoria was using her authority to eliminate Catherine, all because she had mentioned she was a graduate of Solomia Information University.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sudden, arbitrary decision was obviously a retaliation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several people in the line, who were also from Solomia Information University, exchanged disappointed looks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One by one, they stepped out of the line, their hopes dashed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some even moved forward to protest, but were quickly stopped by their own classmates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victoria was the wife of Leif Leonard, the General Manager of Sync Group's Solomia branch. No one dared to challenge her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The situation was clear: people with connections could bypass the system, while everyone else was left powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gloria stood by, a smug smile on her face as she watched the chaos unfold. "Catherine, did you see that? You want to challenge me? I have a hundred ways to destroy you. Even if you manage to get into Sync Group today, with me here, your life won't be easy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gloria was reveling in her victory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had learned from Victoria's subtle manipulation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just a small twist of the rules, she had managed to block Catherine from even getting a fair shot, all without leaving a trace of wrongdoing. It was a masterstroke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine's heart sank as she watched people walk away, all because of her university.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been better qualified than Gloria in every way&mdash;her experience, her academic background, her work ethic&mdash;but Gloria, with her connections, had managed to manipulate everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was an overwhelming feeling of injustice and helplessness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you still standing there for? Leave now, and don't disrupt our recruitment event any further!" Victoria snapped coldly, her voice sharp and dismissive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The contempt in her words stung Catherine, who had already been humiliated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victoria's years of experience in the workplace gave her the upper hand, and it was clear that she saw Catherine as nothing more than an insignificant nuisance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you abusing your power?" Marcus' voice rang out again, interrupting the tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Victoria gave him a mocking smile and shrugged. "Don't talk nonsense. Which part of this situation do you see as an abuse of power? Maybe your friend is impressive, but she doesn't meet our hiring criteria. What exactly do you think you can do about it?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
