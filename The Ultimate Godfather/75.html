        <h1>Chapter 74 Help Her</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing what the nurse said, Josie suddenly changed her face. She stood up in a hurry and said to Marcus with an apologetic look, "I'm sorry, Mr. Fitzgerald. There is an emergency at home, so I have to go to the hospital first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you are not in a hurry, just wait for me here. I will deal with the matter over there as soon as possible and come back to customize a plan for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked, "Is your husband's father sick?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Josie's anxious expression, if the nurse hadn't said it, Marcus would have thought he was her father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I'm sorry for wasting your time, Mr. Fitzgerald. My husband died early, and his parents are old, so I have been taking care of them. My husband entrusted them to me, and I treat them as my biological parents," Josie explained, her beautiful eyes slightly reddening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Marcus was somewhat moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were very few women who could treat their husbands' parents wholeheartedly after their husbands died, not to mention in today's society where profit was paramount, even in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, Josie was so kind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm unfamiliar with Kingston, and it's boring to wait here. Why don't I go with you, Ms. Shelman?" Marcus said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie was stunned, then gave an unnatural smile and said, "Mr. Fitzgerald, if you don't mind, let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he got into her Mercedes-Benz.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This car was at least ten years old.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>According to Josie's social status, she could afford to buy more expensive luxury cars. This showed that she was not only kind but also very frugal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of the ICU ward at Kingston Hospital, an elderly woman, Janet Anderson, with graying hair, anxiously waited outside, leading a five or six-year-old girl, Leia Anderson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie, wearing high heels, and Marcus came up to the two of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Janet, how is Vincent?" she asked anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet's eyes were red. "He was already in a bad condition at 10 o'clock in the morning. I was afraid of delaying your work, so I wasn't going to tell you. Leia called your secretary..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she began to sob softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their son passed away early, and the two old people depended on each other for survival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Josie was nice and very inspiring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their family had gone from poverty to success, all thanked to her hard work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, even if Vincent entered the ICU, Janet didn't want to delay Josie's work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Janet, didn't I tell you a long time ago that I'm worried that he might have a heart condition? If there's any problem, you have to notify me immediately. Did the doctor say something? What are the chances of Vincent being cured?" Josie sighed, her face full of anxiety.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing that, Janet burst into tears. "The chance is slim...The rescue now is just the last struggle..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Josie couldn't help shedding tears. "Janet, don't cry. Even if Vincent is in danger, you still have me and Leia, and we will always be with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this time, the door of the ICU ward was pushed open, and several doctors in coats walked out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie hurriedly asked, "Doctor, how is Vincent?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor shook his head helplessly and said, "Who among you is a family member? Go in and see him for the last time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet almost fainted on the spot, unable to accept the result.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie supported her with one hand and led her five-year-old daughter with the other, walking into the ICU.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's eyes flickered as he followed behind them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the ICU bed, an old man with grey hair and a pale face lay unconscious, only breathing faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vincent, we're here to see you. Please wake up." Seeing Vincent, who was about to die, Josie burst into tears, feeling that she had failed her deceased husband's wishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Janet, Josie, and Leia were also shouting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vincent seemed to have heard the voice of his relatives, and his fingers moved slightly, and then there was no response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Marcus had already seen his illness through his eyes of perspective.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The aorta in his heart was blocked, causing his heart to stop supplying blood. This disease was fatal if it recurred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was difficult to save the patient even in a hospital with superb medical skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it was easy to use the healing techniques in the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire. Marcus only needed to use his Numinous Energy to unblock Vincent's blocked blood vessels.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without hesitation, he took a step forward and directly held Vincent's hand. The powerful Numinous Energy flowed along Vincent's arm and into his body...</span></p></div>
