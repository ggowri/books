  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He became a lifeless corpse!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this, the crowd gasped in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of the women even screamed and crouched down, their faces as pale as ghosts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone... someone's been killed..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, a voice emerged from the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes instinctively turned toward the second floor of the banquet hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There, several women with foreign features appeared out of nowhere. They wore tight leather skirts and had striking, seductive figures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These women held heavy sniper rifles, with the barrels all aimed directly at Miles and his men!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles' expression immediately turned grim, a chill running down his spine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Evander, Callista, and Chloe were stunned. They hadn't expected so many heavily armed foreign women to suddenly appear in the banquet hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evander couldn't help but ask Marcus, "Who exactly are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he realized that Marcus might not be as simple as he had thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, however, ignored Miles and didn't respond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost at the same time, the large door of the banquet hall opened again. Another group of women, all with foreign features, dressed in tight leather skirts and with seductive figures, walked in, their high heels clicking on the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, in front of everyone's gaze, these women knelt on one knee in unison, their faces filled with respect as they saluted, "Mr. Death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words echoed throughout the hall, freezing everyone in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected this young man to truly be the legendary Death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles, Selena, and Chloe's eyes were full of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never imagined that Evander's words were true, especially Miles and Selena, who had previously mocked and belittled Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles had even said that</span><span> even</span><span> if Marcus were truly </span><span>Mr. </span><span>Death, he would kill him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, </span><span>the </span><span>armed forces </span><span>that made </span><span>Miles</span><span> proud </span><span>stood </span><span>no</span><span> chance in front of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the very beginning of the banquet, Marcus had already taken control of the situation. He had simply been toying with Miles and Selena, letting them act recklessly until it was time to close in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you really are Mr. Death..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chloe's eyes sparkled, full of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, she understood why Marcus had seemed so calm despite the tense situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled and said, "I told you before, but you didn't believe me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Chloe couldn't help but feel a sense of shame. She looked down and said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles, who had been so arrogant before, now stood in front of dozens of heavy sniper rifles, his face completely darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that if Marcus wanted to, he could </span><span>be riddled with bullets</span><span> in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing death, Miles was overwhelmed with fear. He couldn't bear it any longer and suddenly collapsed to his knees in front of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice trembling, he begged, "Mr. Death, I was blind before, and I offended you. Please, for the sake of my years of service to Royal Entertainment, forgive me just this once. In the future, I will repay your kindness with my life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the face of death, so-called dignity was nothing but worthless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially after he saw his man get shot in the head with a single bullet, Miles' will to fight was completely shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the people he had trained were skilled, the situation had completely fallen under Marcus' control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It could be said that the lives of everyone present were now entirely in Marcus' hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Donovan, you have a gun in your hand. Why are you afraid of him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Selena said, her face full of unwillingness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed she couldn't accept the situation before her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Selena could finish her words, Miles suddenly stood up and slapped her across the face, growling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You worthless woman, shut your mouth! Are you trying to get me killed?</span></p><div class="pagination">
