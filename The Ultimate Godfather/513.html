Just get rid of him on the spot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus were eliminated, the position of the family heir would undoubtedly belong to Cloe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Urged repeatedly by Neil, Landon finally lost his patience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gestured to the armed men behind him, signaling them to take action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at this moment, a cold, commanding voice echoed from outside the room, sharp and authoritative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice sounded full of energy and even had a hint of dominance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, everyone saw a tall young man in a military uniform stepping into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Behind him were several men in armed uniforms, their presence exuding an intimidating aura that filled the space with tension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Thurman family members froze in shock at the sight of the man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though their family was barely considered second-rate, even in Kingston, they recognized the identity of the newcomer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was none other than </span><span>Battle God</span><span> Oliver!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The youngest general in all of Uswad, Oliver was also the next heir to the Deleon family, the most powerful family in the country.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a figure revered by countless people, and now, he had appeared at the Thurman Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shock among the Thurman family members was immeasurable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew that their family's status was far too insignificant to even come close to someone of Oliver's caliber.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Landon, stunned by the unexpected arrival, was unsure why </span><span>Battle God</span><span> Oliver had come to the Thurman Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nonetheless, Landon hurried forward to greet him, bowing deeply. "Welcome, </span><span>Battle God</span><span> Oliver!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Landon was the son of the Whitman family patriarch. Most of the Whitman family's assets were now under the control of the Deleon family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as Marcus had previously pointed out, Landon and his father, Kent, were essentially puppets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver, on the other hand, was not only the heir to the powerful Deleon family but also a celebrated war hero in Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His status far surpassed Landon's in every way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, to everyone's shock, Oliver ignored Landon's greeting entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the gaze of everyone in the room, Oliver strode past Landon and stopped in front of Marcus. Then, to the astonishment of all, he bowed deeply. "Nice to meet you, Mr. Fitzgerald!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight left everyone in the room dumbfounded, their expressions filled with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially Landon, whose mind went blank as if struck by lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even wondered if he was hallucinating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Absolutely impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver was a celebrated figure across Uswad, the future heir of the nation's most prestigious family, the Deleon family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, here he was, bowing to Marcus and addressing him as "Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This utterly shattered everyone's understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus merely waved a hand at Oliver without speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver straightened up and turned his piercing gaze to Landon. He said, "I hear you've been parading yourself as the future heir of the Whitman family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Landon's face turned grim. He replied, "My father is the patriarch of the Whitman family. Naturally, I am its future heir. </span><span>Battle God</span><span>, is there something wrong with that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver sneered coldly, "Without the Deleon family's support, the Whitman family would have ceased to exist long ago. Whether or not the Whitman family has a future is still uncertain. Even if it does, there's no such thing as an heir to the patriarch. And yet, you dare to call yourself that. What audacity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Landon's face darkened further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming pressure from Oliver's aura made it hard for him to breathe, let alone argue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And I hear you were planning to act against Mr. Fitzgerald?" Oliver continued to ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Landon gritted his teeth and said, "He meddled in the affairs of the Thurman family. I found it intolerable and intended to act accordingly. Please, </span><span>Battle God</span><span>, understand my position."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Insolence!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oliver's thunderous voice sent a chill down the spines of Landon, Neil, and Cloe, leaving their faces deathly pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bow and apologize to Mr. Fitzgerald immediately. For your father's sake, I might spare your life. Otherwise, don't blame me for being ruthless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After these words were spoken, Landon's face turned even darker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never imagined that Oliver would side with Marcus, much less demand he bow and apologize to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Landon feared Oliver, being forced in public ignited his defiance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said unwillingly, "I am the son of the Whitman family patriarch. Why should I bow and apologize to him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you are the </span><span>Battle God</span><span> and the future heir of the Deleon family, my uncle is still the current head of your family. Aren't you overstepping your bounds?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Neil and Cloe exchanged glances, a sense of satisfaction surging in their hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their eyes, this was the kind of dominance they expected from Landon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in the face of a </span><span>Battle God</span><span> like Oliver, he couldn't overstep his bounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wonder if your father, Kent, knows that you dare to speak to me this way."</span></p><div class="pagination">
