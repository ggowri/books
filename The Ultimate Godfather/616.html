  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Elena felt deeply wronged. In her mind, every customer who entered the store, regardless of whether they intended to purchase anything, deserved to be treated with sincerity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if a customer couldn't afford something now, there was always the possibility that they would strike it rich one day. But Natalie was more pragmatic, even to the point of sacrificing her professional integrity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, with no choice in the matter, Elena shot Marcus a sympathetic glance before turning to attend to Joan. Meanwhile, Natalie went to the storage room to fetch the Tears of the Angel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As word spread that someone was about to purchase the Tears of the Angel, the other customers in the store immediately caused a stir. All eyes turned in their direction, with a hint of envy in their gazes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Mrs. Jenkins. Mrs. Jenkins is buying the Tears of the Angel. She's really rich."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, her husband's a famous oil tycoon here in Solomia. One Tears of the Angel? Heck, she can buy ten or a hundred of them if she wants."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I heard Mr. Jenkins isn't just wealthy. He has a huge network and knows all the big shots in Kingston."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And he's also well-connected with world-class oil tycoons from </span><span>Kingston</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How I wish I could marry a man like that. When will I ever be so lucky?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People whispered among themselves, their eyes full of admiration and envy for Joan. These comments didn't seem to bother Joan in the slightest. She was used to being the center of attention wherever she went. With her status and wealth, this kind of thing happened all the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon enough, Natalie returned with the Tears of the Angel. The moment the gift box was opened, the necklace released a dazzling light. In that instant, all the other jewelry in the store seemed to lose its vibrancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tears of the Angel is truly the crown jewel of this year's collection. It's stunning. Wrap it up for me. I'll take it." Joan's eyes sparkled as she immediately fell for the necklace. The crowd once again looked at her with envy. At 18.88 million, she bought it without a second thought&mdash;a true luxury in action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just then, Marcus spoke up, his voice cutting through the murmurs, "Sorry, I was the first to see the Tears of the Angel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't that he wanted to go against Joan. Today was Jade's birthday, and Marcus had to buy a gift that was worthy of the occasion. In his eyes, only this necklace could match Jade's status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as he spoke, everyone in the store turned their attention to him, their gazes the same. Especially Natalie, whose brows furrowed in clear disdain. She shot him a mocking look. "Marcus, why do you keep causing trouble? Didn't I tell you? If you want a necklace, go next door. Those stores are more </span><span>affordable for you</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That Tears of the Angel costs nearly 20 million. Do you honestly think you can afford it? You're just here to mess things up, aren't you? If you keep this up, I'll have security toss you out. I won't care about our old friendship!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joan, meanwhile, had also turned her gaze to Marcus. She looked at Natalie and asked, "Who is he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie put on an apologetic smile and responded, "He's an old high school classmate of mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she briefly explained the history between her and Marcus to Joan. Joan looked at him with clear disdain. "Why bother being polite to someone like him? Just get security to throw him out. He can't afford it anyway."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie nodded in agreement. "Mrs. Jenkins, please don't be upset. I've been giving him chances because of our past, but I'll take care of it now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joan sighed, "You're too soft-hearted. You keep giving him chances, but he's not showing you any respect. If anyone else were in your shoes, they'd have walked away by now. If this guy keeps acting up, your sale will be ruined, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalie nodded vigorously. "Yes. Thank you for the advice, Mrs. Jenkins. I'll have him thrown out right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Security, get in here! Get this man out of here. He's ruining our business!" As her words rang out, a group of security guards rushed in, surrounding Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The head of security, Gabe Palmer, coldly addressed him, "Kid, you really have no idea who runs this place, do you? Causing a scene here? I'm giving you three seconds to get out before we take action."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All eyes were now on Marcus, waiting to see how he would respond to the threat of security. After all, anyone who could run such an upscale store in the heart of the city had to be someone important. Everyone was curious to see how this would end for Marcus.</span></p><div class="pagination">
