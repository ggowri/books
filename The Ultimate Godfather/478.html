  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade spoke calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was a strong-willed woman who didn't want to spend her life sheltered by her father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What bothered her more was that while in Solariae, Robert kept insisting she study abroad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>While studying abroad was a coveted opportunity for most doctors, Jade was deeply resistant to the idea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As they reached an intersection, a sudden gunshot rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The windshield of Marcus' Aston Martin was struck, the bullet piercing through both the front and rear glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The attack happened so quickly that the bullet almost hit Jade in the head!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade screamed in terror, her face pale as she curled up in her seat, trembling uncontrollably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus frowned, his eyes sharp with fury. He hadn't expected someone to open fire on his car in the middle of the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was obvious they were targeting him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without hesitation, he turned the car and sped toward another road.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bang! Bang! Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Several more gunshots followed, bullets coming from all directions and aimed squarely at Marcus' car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Jade in the car, Marcus had no better option but to drive out of the crowded area as quickly as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was the only way to protect Jade and the innocent people in the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The sound of gunfire sent the crowd into a panic, scattering in every direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Marcus...what's going on? Are we being robbed?" Jade asked, her voice trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Curled up in her seat, Jade's voice shook as she spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Though she appeared strong on the surface, it was clear that she was easily frightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At this moment, she was utterly terrified, her face drained of color as she showed signs of severe shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This isn't a robbery. It's an assassination attempt against me!" Marcus said flatly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus replied calmly as he expertly maneuvered the car. In under ten minutes, the Aston Martin was out of Solomia's city limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They reached a highway leading into the mountains, surrounded by lush green foliage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The distant mountain ranges were a breathtaking sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Stay in the car for a bit. I'm going to take care of them," Marcus instructed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He gave Jade a quick command, and she nodded, her body trembling. "Come back soon...I'm so scared..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus stepped out of the car and used the Heavenly Circle Diagram to set up a simple rune on the vehicle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This would effectively shield the car from incoming bullets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bang! Bang! Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From a short distance, more gunshots rang out, bullets speeding toward Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was evident that as Marcus drove out of Solomia, his would-be assassins had followed closely behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With Jade momentarily secure, Marcus could now focus entirely on the fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked into the distance and saw six or seven tall men with Weston features stepping out of a white van.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Each of them carried heavy weaponry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus noticed that among them were three fourth-generation cyborgs and two metahumans.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The fourth-generation cyborgs were far more advanced than those of the Black Hawk Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The metahumans were at Stage Four, equivalent to Ancient Martial Stage Four experts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Such a lineup would be a formidable force anywhere in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Yet, here they were in Solomia, aiming to kill Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without Marcus' quick reflexes, either he would have been shot in the head, or Jade would have been caught in the crossfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Pathetic Uswadian, prepare to die!" one of the metahumans shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The leading metahuman had heterochromatic eyes&mdash;one icy blue and the other fiery red&mdash;giving him an eerie, menacing presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In broken Uswadic, he hurled a taunt at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who sent you?" Marcus asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He needed to know who was behind this underhanded attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Since you're about to die, it won't hurt to tell you. A few days ago, you killed Professor Cole. The Cole family was furious and paid a hefty sum to have us come to Uswad and take your life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The heterochromatic metahuman sneered as he spoke to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A silver-haired female metahuman beside him looked at Marcus with disdain. "Honestly, I think the Cole family is overreacting. Judging by his aura, he's only at Ancient Martial Stage Two. Sending so many of us to kill him is such a waste of resources!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"But that's not our concern. The Cole family is filthy rich. As long as they pay, we'll kill whoever they want," she added with a smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A cyborg nearby chuckled coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To them, Marcus' Ancient Martial Stage Two seemed laughably weak. Any one of them could easily kill him.</span></p><div class="pagination">
