        <h1>Chapter 251 Did That Feel Good?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle's body trembled uncontrollably, and her cries echoed through the office. A wave of pure ecstasy washed over her, leaving her breathless. The dampness between her thighs deepened, soaking the seat cushion beneath her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus... This is the office. You can't do this here..." she murmured, her voice barely audible, as if clinging to the last shred of reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled, his tone full of teasing amusement, "Oh? You were the one doing that here just now. If you can, why can't I?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle's face turned crimson, and she wished she could disappear into thin air. "I don't know why, Marcus. Ever since we were together, I can't stop thinking about it. But you've been so busy&mdash;we haven't seen each other in weeks. I couldn't help myself earlier, and..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing her words, Marcus felt a pang of guilt. It was true&mdash;his life was chaotic, filled with countless demands and the presence of many women vying for his attention. It wasn't intentional, but he had neglected her. Just as Michelle had said, since their first time together, it had been far too long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Women were different from men in their desires. Before experiencing intimacy, they might not feel the need strongly. But once that door was opened, it was nearly impossible to close again. Michelle was in her early twenties, a time when her body's needs were at their peak. Her longing wasn't just natural&mdash;it was inevitable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it's this hard for you, why hold back?" Marcus grinned mischievously. Without waiting for her reply, he leaned forward, burying his face against her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Michelle gasped, her body trembling at his touch. It had been too long since she'd felt his hands on her, and every sensation seemed amplified. Her hands instinctively clutched at his head, her breaths turning shallow and rapid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his lips teased her sensitive skin, Marcus' hand ventured under her skirt, finding the wet warmth he'd been seeking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have no idea how much I've missed you, Marcus. Please, promise me you'll come see me more often." Michelle breathed between gasps, her words tinged with both longing and vulnerability. As she spoke, her legs parted instinctively, her body ready and waiting for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't need further invitations. His restraint snapped, and with a swift motion, he joined with her. "Ah..." Michelle cried out, her voice rising in an uncontrollable moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, Michelle felt utterly filled, a long-lost sense of completeness washing over her and leaving her mind blank. Her body instinctively tightened around Marcus, syncing with his rhythm as her movements grew more responsive. Feeling her change, Marcus quickened his pace, each thrust reaching her deepest, most sensitive places.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The overwhelming sensations made Michelle lightheaded, her breath hitching as Marcus swept her off the chair, holding her close by her hips while continuing his </span><span>relentless motion. Michelle cried out, her body trembling as if trying to pull Marcus in even deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The intensity coursing through Marcus was undeniable. Every woman he knew had her own unique allure, and Michelle's gentle, tender nature made her stand out. After weeks apart, he couldn't help but pour all his longing and passion into her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their escapade moved from the office chair to the couch and finally to the floor-to-ceiling windows. They explored one another with unrestrained fervor, trying every angle and position they could imagine. Under Marcus' persistent onslaught, Michelle reached her peak again and again, her earlier, unsated desires now completely fulfilled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At last, Michelle reclined on the couch, her body spent but glowing. Her flawless curves were accentuated by the light sheen of sweat on her skin, her cheeks flushed with a rosy hue that made her even more captivating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, breathing heavily, sank down beside her, the exertion leaving him just as spent. "Did that feel good?" he asked softly, his tone filled with affection as he reached for her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still lost in the lingering waves of her release, Michelle nodded weakly. "So good, Marcus. You made me feel amazing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Smiling, Marcus pulled her into his arms, stroking her hair as they shared a rare, quiet moment together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Something about the office added an undeniable edge to their intimacy. For the first time, Marcus understood why some people were drawn to such adventurous settings. He'd always thought it was a bit odd, but now he could see the appeal&mdash;it was undeniably thrilling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterward, the two turned their attention to Golden Group's performance. Despite her flushed appearance, Michelle quickly regained her composure as she updated Marcus on the company's recent progress. Thanks to her dedicated efforts over the past two months, the company had recovered from its earlier turbulence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Golden Group's revenue had now nearly returned to its peak levels. According to the financial reports, the company's projected profit by the end of the year was expected to reach approximately 50 billion.</span></p></div>
