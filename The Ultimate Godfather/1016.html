  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two Grandmasters threw themselves into their attacks with everything they had, pushing their bodies to the limit to release every ounce of hidden power. They were determined to crush Marcus and end him right here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus only sneered, his voice dripping with scorn, "You know, if you'd shown some sense, I wouldn't have bothered with your pathetic little family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now... after everything you've done? After torturing my woman? Well, don't say I didn't warn you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, a crushing energy began to radiate from Marcus' body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the very air seemed to thicken, and the space around them felt suffocating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Grandmasters' attacks, powerful as they were, came to a complete halt, frozen in mid-air as if time itself had been bent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd watched in stunned silence. No one could believe their eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of power is this? How are you freezing our attacks?" one of the Grandmasters demanded, his voice trembling with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' response was cold, almost casual. "You don't deserve to know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a word, he raised his hand, and a wave of destruction pulsed from his palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like the force of an entire storm unleashed in an instant, tearing through the air toward that Grandmaster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That Grandmaster's face turned ashen with fear as he realized just how outclassed he was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to dodge, but it was too late.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The power hit him like a freight train, and with a deafening crash, his body crumpled under its force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a heartbeat, he was reduced to nothing but a mangled heap of flesh, his body breaking apart at an impossible speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The spectators were frozen in horror, unable to process what they had just seen. Marcus' casual strike had obliterated one of the strongest among them with ease, and they couldn't comprehend the terrifying scale of his power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other Grandmaster, now fully aware of his hopeless situation, tried to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He realized that he was no match for Marcus. With a burst of speed, he tried to flee, hoping to save his life by running.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus was too fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the Grandmaster could even take a few steps, a massive hand shot out and grabbed him by the throat, lifting him effortlessly off the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Grandmaster's eyes widened with fear as he struggled, but it was no use.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Marcus' grip, he was nothing more than a helpless insect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd gasped in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once-untouchable Grandmasters were like children in front of this monstrous force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been brought to their knees without a chance to even fight back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please... please spare me... I beg you," the Grandmaster pleaded, his voice barely above a whisper as fear flooded his every word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had spent centuries building his power, and the thought of losing it all in one foolish move was unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, he was willing to do anything to survive, even groveling for his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't even flinch. "I gave you your chance. But you squandered it. Now, don't expect any mercy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a swift motion, his grip tightened, and the sickening sound of bones snapping filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Grandmaster's body crumpled with a sickening crunch, his blood spilling into the void as his form dissolved into nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd watched in horror, unable to tear their eyes away from the gruesome sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus tossed the Grandmaster aside as if he were nothing more than trash, then casually reached for the three Spatial Rings from the fallen Grandmasters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes swept over the remaining Tucker family members, and an eerie silence filled the air.</span></p><div class="pagination">
