  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They suddenly realized that the high-ranking military official mentioned by </span><span>Ryker</span><span> was none other than Marcus Fitzgerald!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The same young man who had remained unusually calm throughout the entire confrontation with Hank, despite the pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long ago, he had been insulted by Helen, who called him a "country bumpkin"&mdash;a migrant worker from the rural areas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, in </span><span>Ryker</span><span>'s words, this so-called "country bumpkin" was revealed to be a key figure in the military.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For everyone present, this was completely unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially Dexter and Helen both of them were utterly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This can't be happening! This guy is just a tenant in our building! He still needs to rent a place to stay&mdash;how could he possibly be some big shot in the military? Commander </span><span>Zeller</span><span>, you must have made a mistake, surely you've confused him with someone else," Dexter said, his disbelief evident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" </span><span>Ryker</span><span> silenced him with a sharp order. "Our military leaders are not people you can slander. Deputy Commander Falkner, arrest him along with the others!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Commander </span><span>Zeller</span><span>!" Jareth responded immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Dexter's face turned pale with despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though he was the Deputy Director of the police precinct, to </span><span>Ryker</span><span>, he was practically nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One word from </span><span>Ryker</span><span> could easily end his career&mdash;or worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even his cousin, Hank, held a lower rank than </span><span>Ryker</span><span>, and now they were surrounded by heavily armed soldiers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, Dexter knew he was as good as finished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His wife's face went white, and she turned desperately to Hank. "Hank, Dexter is your cousin! You can't let them take him away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" Before she could speak further, Hank snapped at her, his voice cold and biting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shot her a look of disdain and said through gritted teeth, "If it weren't for you and your troublemaking ways, none of this would have happened. How could we have ever angered someone this powerful in the military? And now you come to me for help? Can't you see I'm barely hanging on myself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Dexter's wife heard this, her face drained of color, and she nearly collapsed to the ground, overwhelmed by despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hank had already realized that </span><span>Ryker</span><span> and his men were serious. What they said wasn't just a bluff.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suppressing his rising anxiety, Hank forced himself to speak up, addressing </span><span>Ryker</span><span>, "Commander </span><span>Zeller</span><span>, you say this man is a big shot in the military. I need to know&mdash;what's his position? I need to know the truth, even if it costs me my life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as those words left his mouth, everyone present leaned in, eager to hear the answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What Hank wanted to know, they wanted to know just as badly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiera, in particular, was eyeing Marcus with an expression of utter disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew Marcus Fitzgerald was someone extraordinary&mdash;he had a vast network of businesses, and even Solomia police treated him with the utmost respect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she never imagined that the Uswad military held him in such high regard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To protect him, the commander of the Solace Military Division had personally led troops to rescue him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were calling Marcus a major figure in the military. It was almost too surreal to believe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she hadn't been certain everything was real now, Kiera might have thought she was dreaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ryker</span><span>'s gaze shifted to Hank, and he said calmly, "Hank Foster, as the City Governer of Solomia, I'm sure you've heard about the special military advisor we recently appointed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment the words left </span><span>Ryker</span><span>'s lips, Hank, along with everyone else in the room, froze in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Special Military Advisor&mdash;the person who had rescued Julian Ashford on the streets of Solomia&mdash;that was the person they were talking about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although there were no official documents or videos to prove it, rumors about the event had spread like wildfire throughout Uswad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, everyone in Uswad knew such a legendary figure.</span></p><div class="pagination">
