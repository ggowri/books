  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, the other </span><span>Ophidian was uttery petrified.</span><span> He never imagined that the young man before him would be this powerful&mdash;so powerful that he didn't even dare to resist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, before he could run back to the cave, </span><span>Marcus</span><span>'s large hand directly clamped onto his shoulder.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>H</span><span>e</span><span> was horrified as he desperately tried to break free, but it was completely futile.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span>'s large hand squeezed, and a crisp sound of bone breaking echoed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The bones in his shoulder</span><span>s</span><span> were completely crushed.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He let out a piercing scream, unleashing all the </span><span>power</span><span> within his body in desperation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He turned his hand and struck a palm toward </span><span>Marcus</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This palm contained all the power of the </span><span>Ophidians</span><span>, </span><span>and it was upon</span><span> </span><span>Marcu</span><span>s</span><span> in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, this </span><span>Ophidian</span><span>'s cultivation had reached the </span><span>Acquired State</span><span>, and the power of a full-force attack was not to be underestimated.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie</span><span>, watching from the side, felt her heart race with fear.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, </span><span>Marcus</span><span> didn't care at all, casually releasing an attack that easily intercepted the opponent's strike.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A terrifying rumble echoed as </span><span>Marcus</span><span>'s attack swept through like a hot knife through butter, completely destroying the opponent's strike in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, it swiftly broke through the opponent's defense and landed on </span><span>HIS</span><span> chest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next moment, the </span><span>Ophidian</span><span>'s face was filled with terror as he watched </span><span>Marcus</span><span>'s attack swiftly pierce through his chest.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It s</span><span>hatter</span><span>ed</span><span> his internal organs into pieces</span><span> and </span><span>he was completely reduced to a lifeless corpse!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>All of this sounded complex, but it actually happened in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The two </span><span>at Acquired State</span><span> were all killed by </span><span>Marcus</span><span> alone.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>H</span><span>e was clean and swift, without any hesitation, leaving </span><span>Gertie</span><span> on the side utterly shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let's go, we're heading in!"</span><span> </span><span>Marcus</span><span> said to </span><span>Gertie</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Gertie</span><span> then came to her senses and entered the cavewith </span><span>Marcus</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After the two were killed, a rapid alarm sounded from inside the cave.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Obviously, these </span><span>creatures</span><span> had already noticed the arrival of intruders.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Therefore, as soon as </span><span>Marcus</span><span> and </span><span>Gertie</span><span> entered the cave, many gathered.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This cave was even more spacious than </span><span>Marcus</span><span> had imagined.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The farther they went in, the larger the space became.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He and </span><span>Gertie</span><span> had only advanced a little over a hundred meters when the openness ahead exceeded his imagination, with a diameter of at least several thousand meters.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It looked like an entirely different world within the cliff walls.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who are you</span><span>?</span><span> </span><span>How</span><span> dare </span><span>you </span><span>invade </span><span>our</span><span> territory?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Among the gathered </span><span>Ophidian</span><span>, a tall and muscular figure with the head of a Titan python stepped out from the crowd.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The aura of this person was at least above the third level of </span><span>Acquired State Three</span><span>, likely a leader-like figure.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What do you mean by your territory? This is the world within the </span><span>Ice Wall</span><span>, and we are the true masters here!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus</span><span> sneered as he spoke.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even surrounded by dozens of enemies, Marcus remained utterly unshaken.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The Ophidians stared at him in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One of them with only one eye</span><span> sneered and said, "You'</span><span>ve</span><span> </span><span>got some guts </span><span>for a prisoner in a cage, daring to break in here and even killing two of our guards."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"To tell you the truth, it won't be long before this world is under our control, and you prisoners will only serve as our slaves!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After saying this, </span><span>he</span><span> burst into wild laughter, his laughter filled with arrogance.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, before he could laugh for long, a terrifying </span><span>First Ray</span><span> had already descended</span><span>!</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sensing that terrifying aura descending, the </span><span>creature</span><span> realized something was wrong.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But it was already too late.</span></p><div class="pagination">
