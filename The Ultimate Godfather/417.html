"I really need to head home, Mr. Fitzgerald. My mom will be calling soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Without wasting another second, Grace hurried into the bathroom, took a quick shower, did a light touch-up on her makeup, and got dressed before leaving the Hilton Hotel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After Grace left, Marcus dialed Yvonne Miller's number to check on her recovery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After taking Marcus' pill, Yvonne was feeling great.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She was nearly back to normal now, which brought relief to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He then called Michelle Smith to ask about the status of the pharmaceutical park's production.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thanks to several days of careful adjustments, the production line was running smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The first batch of medicines had been produced, packed, and was now ready to be shipped out to distributors across the country.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This was a major win for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The park's successful launch meant a stable source of income for him every year, giving him the financial muscle to build his own power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hanging up, Marcus planned to head back to Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But then, his phone buzzed&mdash;Aston Martin's service center had called to say his car was ready.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Having gone without a car for a few days, Marcus was feeling the inconvenience, so he immediately took a cab to the dealership.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite the severe crash, his car looked brand new after the repairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The repair bill came to 250 thousand, but Marcus planned to cover it with his insurance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, the dealership staff told him they only needed him to pay 150 thousand dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Apparently, a delivery driver from QuickHaul had dropped off 100 thousand dollars for the repairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The driver had specified that it was for Marcus' car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus immediately understood who the driver was&mdash;it was probably the couple from the QuickHaul van involved in the accident.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>From their conversation that day, Marcus had gathered that their life was difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They had a child who was often in the hospital, racking up massive medical bills every month.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus had decided to take responsibility for the accident, but now he was deeply moved that the driver, despite his own struggles, had scraped together 100 thousand dollars to help pay for the repairs, which was really touching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, the driver left this letter for you. Would you like to read it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>A sweet-faced saleswoman came up to Marcus and handed him an envelope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus opened it and saw a few hastily scrawled lines of handwriting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Dear Sir, I'm really sorry for the accident I caused while rushing to pick up a delivery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I also want to thank you for your kindness in covering the repair costs despite my circumstances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Even though I'm struggling, I know it's my responsibility.

He hadn't expected the QuickHaul driver to be the type to own up to his mistakes so bravely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even with his own tough circumstances, the man still felt it was important to take responsibility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus turned to the saleswoman and asked, "Did he leave any contact details, like an address or phone number?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The saleswoman shook her head. "No, he didn't."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus felt a bit disappointed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But then a thought struck him&mdash;he could check the security footage from that time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It didn't take long to find the footage, and he spotted the QuickHaul driver's license plate right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus immediately called Amelia Morgan at City Hall to look up the details associated with that license plate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Less than five minutes later, Amelia called back with the information.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian Baird, 25 years old, local to Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He lived at 403, Building 28, Sunnybrook Gardens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Phone number 18604604587</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The details matched the name in the letter, so Marcus was confident they were accurate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>With that, Marcus drove straight to Sunnybrook Gardens.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Sunnybrook Gardens was a dilapidated, low-income housing development in the southern part of Solomia, built in the 1990s as part of a local urban renewal project.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The area was filled with run-down, cramped houses that gave off a distinctly worn-out feel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The surroundings were worse than even the neighborhood where Catherine and his family lived, filled with transient workers and people just getting by.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was a place where crime and shady dealings were rampant, and it had become a hotspot for the underworld.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thirty minutes later, Marcus pulled up to Sunnybrook Gardens.</span></p><div class="pagination">
