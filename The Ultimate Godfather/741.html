By midday, Royal Entertainment's market value had plummeted below 300 billion </span><span>Uswadian</span><span> coins.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as everyone believed it was headed for delisting, the mysterious tycoon known as "Death" stepped in again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, he acquired 100% of Royal Entertainment's shares for a staggering 250 billion </span><span>Uswadian</span><span> coins, sending shockwaves through </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> business world and causing an earthquake in the entertainment industry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Death's move was swift and surgical, striking right at the heart of the matter. His reputation preceded him&mdash;every company he'd acquired in the past had undergone a complete transformation. Their revenue soared, and their market value skyrocketed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, with his acquisition of Royal Entertainment, Death had officially entered </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> entertainment scene. Whether he could make waves in this fiercely competitive industry, however, was anyone's guess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Marcus had been expanding his business empire rapidly. His wealth came not only from his flourishing enterprises but also from the spoils of defeating his enemies&mdash;many of whom were formidable martial artists at or above Ancient Martial Stage Seven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Spatial Rings of these fallen warriors contained more than just weapons, treasures, and pills. The sheer amount of cash was staggering. Marcus estimated that he now had over 3 trillion </span><span>Uswadian</span><span> coins at his disposal&mdash;a number that granted him unmatched influence in </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> business world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, Marcus had arrived at the summit of Divine Mount, the location Liam had specified. According to Liam, the invited participants would gather here before setting off together to explore the space-time gate at </span><span>Morvalis</span><span> Ice Wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus reached the summit, he immediately noticed that the entire area was shrouded in an Illusion Rune. From the outside, it looked like a towering mountain range&mdash;lush greenery, steep cliffs, and nothing else. Inside the rune, however, was an entirely different world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a Rune master, Marcus had no trouble passing through the Illusion Rune. Once inside, he saw a crowd of experts from </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> world of Ancient Martial Art. The </span><span>weakest among them were at the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Six, with several Stage Seven experts present as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One figure stood out&mdash;a young man with silver hair. His aura was almost at the threshold of Ancient Martial Stage Eight, just one step away from a breakthrough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight surprised Marcus. He had assumed that </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> three major sects&mdash;the Astral Serpent Order, Celestial Arc Order, and Swords Sect&mdash;represented the pinnacle of martial power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Phoenix and Millet had already been slain by Marcus. Only Liam remained. But seeing these martial artists, he realized </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> Ancient Martial world was far more vast and powerful than he'd imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many of these individuals were as strong as, if not stronger than, the sect leaders. The silver-haired youth, in particular, was clearly more formidable than both the late Millet and Liam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's more, Marcus could tell the youth was deliberately suppressing his power. If not for Marcus' own superior cultivation, he wouldn't have been able to discern the young man's true strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed the so-called "three major sects" were famous only among the mundane world. In reality, ancient families and rogue martial artists within </span><span>Uswad's</span><span> Ancient Martial world were just as, if not more, powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumors even spoke of ancient beings who had lived for over a thousand years&mdash;martial artists who had transcended the Foundation Establishment Stage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's this guy? I've never seen him before. How did he get in here? The Illusion Rune didn't give us any warning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I don't recognize him either. It's like he just popped out of nowhere. When did the </span><span>Uswad</span><span>, the world of Ancient Martial Art, get someone like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Judging by his aura, he's only at the Ancient Martial Stage Six. Probably some new prodigy from one of the Ancient Martial Art families."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if he is, barging in without so much as a word is a bit much. Doesn't he have any manners?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus appeared, several warriors huddled together, whispering amongst themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Plenty of unfriendly gazes were directed his way. It wasn't hard to see why&mdash;the Illusion Rune had been set up by them, and no one could enter without their consent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the silver-haired youth and Liam had to wait for their permission before stepping inside. If they decided not to let someone in, even Liam couldn't just stroll through the barrier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus had done exactly that. He walked right in as if the Illusion Rune didn't even exist. By all logic, this should have been a clear sign of Marcus' strength. But instead, it was taken as a blatant show of disrespect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The silver-haired youth gave Marcus a quick glance but, seeing only the aura of the Ancient Martial Stage Six, quickly lost interest. In his eyes, Marcus wasn't worth a second look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Excuse me, but how did you get in here?" a middle-aged man, also at the Ancient Martial Stage Six, stood up and addressed Marcus, his gaze fixed on him as if trying </span><span>to figure him out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus gave the man a brief glance and replied nonchalantly, "I walked in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He could sense the man's spiritual senses probing him the entire time. It was a rude move in the world of Ancient Martial Art&mdash;like someone staring at you through a telescope without your consent. It was invasive and uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing Marcus' curt tone, the man frowned, his expression darkening. "I'm asking how you got past the Illusion Rune. Do you not understand the question, or are you just pretending to be clueless?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow and shot back, "I already said&mdash;I walked in. Are you having trouble understanding, or are you just acting dense?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words mirrored the man's, giving as good as he got. And he wasn't lying. With his mastery of the Heavenly Circle Diagram, the Illusion Rune wasn't a challenge at all. He had, quite literally, walked in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the truth only seemed to enrage the middle-aged man further. Gritting his teeth, he growled, "You brat, trying to cause trouble, huh? You're the first junior to ever talk back to me like this. Looks like I need to teach you a lesson so you'll know how big the world really is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, a powerful aura erupted from the man, manifesting as an invisible mountain in the void that came crashing down toward Marcus with immense force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other warriors around them exchanged knowing looks, amused by the scene. Finally, someone had stepped in to test Marcus. Now, they'd get a clear sense of what this mysterious young man was truly capable of.</span></p><div class="pagination">
