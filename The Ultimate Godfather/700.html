        <h1>Chapter 699 Just Some Lowlife Bodyguard</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Walsh, kill him! Please, just kill him!" the photographer begged through gritted teeth, sweat pouring down his face. He looked like he wanted to tear Marcus apart with his bare hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've got some nerve laying hands on my people," Ross said coldly. "You're digging your own grave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having his personal photographer beaten up in public was like getting his face rubbed in the dirt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he didn't do something about it now, his reputation would become a total joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Ross spoke, he gave a quick signal behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within seconds, several guys in black suits moved in on Marcus. These weren't some average security guards&mdash;these guys meant serious business, and everyone could feel it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The whole place suddenly felt like a powder keg ready to blow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who does this guy think he is? Nobody messes with Mr. Walsh's crew and gets away with it. Man, he's really done it now. Mr. Walsh is pissed. This isn't </span><span>gonna</span><span> end well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Word is he's Lila's bodyguard. The same guy who got Mr. Walsh all worked up when Lila refused to take photos with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait, he's just a freaking bodyguard? I thought he was somebody important. </span><span>A</span><span> </span><span>rent-a-cop thinking he can mess with Mr. Walsh? Dude's not making it out of the Golden Hotel in one piece."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And Lila's got some nerve too, turning down Mr. Walsh over some bodyguard? Big mistake. Now that her guy's gone and attacked Mr. Walsh's photographer, they're both totally screwed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The commotion was drawing quite a crowd now, with people gathering around to watch the drama unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once word got around about what went down, everyone was throwing shade at Lila and Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Ross was the heir to Royal Entertainment. Even the </span><span>Solomia</span><span> government rolled out the red carpet for him. Nobody in the </span><span>Uswad</span><span> entertainment scene would dare mess with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila was so full of herself, thinking she could act all big-time just because she went viral.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She needed a reality check. Her influence meant nothing when she was up against someone like Ross.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lucy was eating this up, watching it all unfold with a smirk. This was perfect&mdash;that idiot bodyguard had just torched any chance Lila had with Ross. The country music goddess' crown was as good as hers now. No one could compete with her anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ross stared down at Marcus with pure contempt. "I don't usually waste my time on nobodies like you, but I'm feeling generous. If you're having second thoughts, you can get down on your knees right now, apologize, hack off your own arm, and deliver this woman to my bedroom. Do that, and maybe&mdash;just maybe&mdash;I'll let you live.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clock's ticking. You've got 10 seconds to decide."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ross stared down at Marcus with a smug grin, like a cat playing with its prey. He had that look in his eyes&mdash;the one that said he thought he had Marcus exactly where he wanted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone in the room turned to watch Marcus, waiting to see how he'd handle this situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More than a few of them shot sympathetic glances at Lila.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was tragic, really. The internet's favorite country music goddess was about to lose </span><span>everything&mdash;her career was hanging by a thread, all because of one bad decision. And now she was about to become nothing more than Ross' plaything. It was such a shame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you deaf or something?" the photographer sneered when Marcus kept quiet. "Mr. Walsh asked you a question."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could even finish his sentence, Marcus' hand flew through the air, landing a brutal slap across the photographer's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood spurted from his nose and mouth as teeth went flying, and he let out an agonized scream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is not your place to speak." Marcus' voice was ice cold. "Want me to put a hole through your other hand too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The photographer shut up </span><span>real</span><span> quick, trembling like a leaf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone else in the room was shaking, too. They couldn't wrap their heads around it. How could Marcus be so ballsy when Ross was threatening him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he actually have enough juice to go toe-to-toe with Ross? That was impossible. Nobody had that kind of power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was just a broke bodyguard&mdash;how could he possibly have that kind of pull?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After watching Marcus humiliate his photographer again, Ross had completely lost face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His teeth clenched as he spat out, "I gave you a chance, and you blew it. Don't blame me for what happens next."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual flick of his wrist, Ross signaled to the security team he'd brought with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They got the message loud and clear, charging at Marcus like a pack of wolves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lila's face twisted with worry as she watched the scene unfold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure, she knew Marcus could handle himself, but these weren't average tough guys&mdash;Ross was Royal Entertainment's golden boy, and his security detail was strictly top-shelf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Going up against that many trained fighters at once wasn't something any normal person could walk away from. Lila's stomach churned as she wondered if Marcus could hold his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Lucy was practically grinning ear to ear. In her mind, Marcus was toast. There was no way he'd survive a beatdown from </span><span>this many guys</span><span> at once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the best part was that no matter who came out on top in this fight, Lucy knew she'd be the real winner. This chaos was her perfect chance to step over Lila and claim that crown as country music goddess.</span><span> </span></p></div>
