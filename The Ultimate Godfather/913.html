  <div class="container"><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Joel was as ruthless as they came. Just for the sake of power, he was willing to cast family ties aside, targeting his own father and daughter without hesitation. The man was a monster in human skin.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As Cecilia's father's most trusted confidant and a loyal retainer of the McHale family, </span><span>Ogder</span><span> couldn't just stand by and watch her be deceived.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The moment he spoke, the entire hall erupted into chaos, and all of them turned to look at Joel. If </span><span>Ogder's</span><span> words were true, then Joel's carefully crafted image would shatter in an instant. Ruthlessness in a power struggle was one thing, but killing one's own father for it? That was a crime no one would forgive.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Joel's expression twisted at the crowd's reaction. Yet instead of wasting words on </span><span>Ogder</span><span>, he simply flicked his wrist.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The next moment, a gunshot rang out, and </span><span>Ogder</span><span> took a bullet to his left leg. He let out a bloodcurdling scream, his body buckling as he dropped to one knee. Blood gushed from the wound, staining the ground beneath him. The sudden violence sent a wave of shock through the crowd. Some of the women couldn't help but scream, instinctively stumbling backward.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you keep spouting nonsense," Joel snarled through gritted teeth, his voice as cold as ice, "the next bullet goes through your head!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But </span><span>Ogder</span><span> wasn't intimidated. His expression remained steely as he spat, "I'm telling the truth. What's wrong, Joel? Are you scared? A beast like you has no right to lead the McHale family!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Joel's hand came down again, and another shot rang out. This time, </span><span>Ogder's</span><span> right leg was blown through. He crumpled, both knees hitting the ground as fresh blood pooled around him. The sight was gruesome, yet his face remained unyielding, showing not a shred of submission.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Cecilia panicked and blurted out, "Stop it! I'll step down as head of the family!" She was terrified Joel would give the order to kill </span><span>Ogder</span><span>. At her words, Joel's face finally showed a hint of satisfaction.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But just as Cecilia was about to sign, Marcus stepped forward and blocked her path without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Cecilia immediately panicked and looked worried. She lowered her voice and pleaded, "Please don't get involved, Mr. Fitzgerald. Uncle Joel won't hesitate to come after you."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had just witnessed Joel's ruthless methods firsthand&mdash;there was no way she wanted Marcus dragged into this because of her.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus simply waved a hand dismissively and said, "I already told you&mdash;while I'm here, no one's taking your place as head of the family."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' words instantly drew the attention of Joel and everyone else in the room. </span><span>Many even turned to Marcus with baffled expressions.</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One voice in the crowd sneered, "Who the hell is this brat with an Oriana Land face? He really thinks he can step into this mess?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another chimed in, "Looks like it. This guy must be out of his damn mind. Even </span><span>Ogder</span><span> got his legs broken, and he thinks he's got a shot? What, is he trying to play the hero?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Someone else scoffed, "Yeah, typical of Oriana Land folks&mdash;never know their own limits. Did you hear him? He really thinks no one can take Cecilia's position while he's around. What a joke!"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Another jeered, "I just </span><span>wanna</span><span> see how this idiot dies in a few minutes."</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The murmurs grew louder, and the way people looked at Marcus turned outright mocking. Even Joel's face twisted into an expression of pure ridicule. He stared Marcus down, an amused glint in his eyes, and said, "What did you just say? I think I misheard you. Why don't you say it again?"</span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Joel wasn't really asking because he hadn't heard&mdash;he just wanted to watch Marcus make a fool of himself. From where Joel stood, the entire situation was under his control. If Marcus wanted to step in, deciding when to crush him was just a matter of Joel's mood.</span></p><div class="pagination">
