        <h1>Chapter 246 Enjoy Eating Prison Food</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police immediately moved to arrest Marcus. "Wait." Before they could get close, Marcus raised a hand to stop them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the matter, hillbilly? Feeling regret now? Too late for that," Madeline sneered, her face full of smug satisfaction. "If you hadn't slandered my husband, I wouldn't have called the cops on you. Regret won't save you now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ignoring her, Marcus turned directly to the officers. "As police officers, shouldn't you investigate before arresting someone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lead officer smirked coldly, "Who do you think you are, questioning our professionalism? Mrs. Parker wouldn't falsely accuse someone. Stop making excuses. You broke the law and will face the consequences. What's there to argue about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus crossed one leg over the other, relaxed. "So, what you're saying is, because she's Mrs. Parker, she's automatically in the right? And anyone with a higher status can't possibly make a mistake?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer's expression turned mocking. "That's one way to look at it. What? Don't tell me you think your status outranks Mr. Parker's."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled lightly, "Well, if that's the case, then let's settle this by comparing status." With that, he pulled out his phone and called Benjamin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The moment Benjamin saw Marcus' number, his tone became respectful and </span><span>deferential. His daughter, Grace, would have been long gone without Marcus' help. And besides, Marcus' identity wasn't as simple as it appeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a brief explanation, Benjamin's anger flared. The thought of someone like Adam being part of his administration was infuriating. Still in Kingston, Benjamin couldn't act directly, so he sent his secretary, Amelia, to handle it and instructed the Department of Justice to investigate Adam thoroughly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To the bystanders, though, Marcus' </span><span>call</span><span> just looked like an act. Most of them eyed him with disdain. After all, Nicole was the only student from a rural background in her entire year. That was well-known among the school's leadership and faculty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They thought, "If Marcus really had such a high status, why would he live in the countryside? He must be faking it, desperate to avoid arrest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Madeline turned to the lead officer. "Captain Joseph, don't let this hillbilly scare you. He's from the sticks, born to a poor farming family. Don't let him fool you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Joseph sneered, "People like him are all the same&mdash;get caught breaking the law, then pretend to know someone important to get out of it. Pathetic. We see through those tricks in a second."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nora couldn't resist laughing. "It's true what they say&mdash;bad character breeds in the worst places. Having a parent like this? Utterly disgraceful!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take him in," Joseph barked. The officers closed in, one pulling out handcuffs to restrain Marcus. Marcus, however, remained seated, one leg casually crossed, his demeanor utterly unbothered by their jeers or their threats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're pretty calm, huh?" one of the officers taunted. "Well, congratulations. You pissed off Mrs. Parker. Hope you enjoy eating prison food&mdash;you've earned it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The officer reached out to grab him when a clear, commanding voice rang out from the doorway, silencing the room. "Stop!" All eyes turned toward the source of the voice. Amelia had arrived, flanked by personnel from the DOJ.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia, who worked at the city government, rarely appeared in public. None of the people present&mdash;including George, one of the most influential figures in Solomia High School&mdash;had ever seen her before. Joseph frowned at her. "And who are you? What do you want?" he asked, his tone sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Without orders from the city government, no one is allowed to touch Mr. Fitzgerald," Amelia said firmly. Her words left everyone stunned. Madeline, Nora, George, and Joseph exchanged looks, their expressions filled with mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"City government?" Madeline scoffed. "My husband works at city hall. If there were orders like that, I'd know about them. A hick like him committing a crime and somehow involving the city government? What a joke."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where did he find this actress?" Madeline sneered, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "Gotta give him credit&mdash;he really knows how to put on a show."</span></p></div>
