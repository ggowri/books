        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Playing dumb?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine hurriedly explained, "I'm not. I just don't remember what I said!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus suddenly halted, gripping Maxine's shoulders, and looked into her eyes. "You said I was your boyfriend and that you'd marry no one but me in this life. Have you forgotten so soon?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's face flushed instantly, and she whispered, "I said that out of necessity. It doesn't count..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doesn't count? You just kissed me in front of everyone, and I gave you my first kiss. Are you trying to back out now?" Marcus pressed on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine rolled her eyes. "I know you have many women around you. Are you saying that was your first kiss? Are you lying without fear of growing a long nose?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked with interest, "Was it your first kiss?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine glared at Marcus and said, "Of course!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled, "Don't worry. I'll take responsibility for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's heart skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, being alone with Marcus now made her heart race, and she was much more nervous than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus continued, "Alright, let's say goodbye here. Your family must have many things that need your attention."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine nodded and turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus pulled her back, pointing to his cheek. "Give me a kiss, or I won't let you go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine glared at Marcus. "Pervert!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she still stood on her tiptoes and kissed Marcus' cheek before quickly walking away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Maxine's retreating figure and feeling the lingering fragrance on his face, Marcus smiled and left as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was preparing to visit Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had missed the elegant, intellectual, and kind woman after not seeing her for </span><span>several days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sky gradually darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Burnett Villa was surrounded by a forest park with lush vegetation all around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dusk, it was deserted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Four strange men blocked his way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A glint flickered in Marcus' eyes as he activated his X-ray vision, instantly realizing that these four men were all cyborgs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, they had mechanical devices far more complex than Gibson's, which meant these four men must be more potent than Gibson!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You killed Mr. Pete Hudson. Today is your death day!" One of the cyborgs spoke coldly in broken </span><span>Uswad</span><span> language.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus immediately understood their origin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were assassins sent by the Hudson family of Eldoria!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gibson and these four men were all in a cyborg state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It showed that Eldoria's cyborg industry was more advanced than he had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next second, one of the cyborgs attacked Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He punched towards Marcus, his fist rapidly transforming and growing countless sharp metal spikes, each nearly ten inches long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this punch hit Marcus, even with Ancient Martial Stage Three cultivation, he would be doomed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, Marcus dodged to the side, swiftly evading his attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, another cyborg's attack arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His arm turned into an extremely sharp battle blade, slashing down from above Marcus' head!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This strike with high speed carried an incredibly terrifying force, as if it could split a mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus barely reacted in time, the blade slicing down along his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He clearly felt the coldness transmitted from the blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Die!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost simultaneously, another cyborg roared, taking a bow stance and puffing out his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His chest rapidly extended a Gatling gun-like barrel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of bangs echoed continuously as countless bullets rained down on Marcus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus quickly dodged and moved to hide behind a boulder, successfully avoiding the barrage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought to himself, "These four cyborgs are incredibly powerful. Based on their displayed combat strength, each is equivalent to an Ancient Martial Stage Three strongman! To kill me, the Hudson family has indeed spared no expense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four cyborgs charged at him fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus cast Lightning swiftly. Four beams of lightning flashed from the void, with arm-thick purple lightning striking down unexpectedly, hitting each of the four cyborgs.</span></p></div>
