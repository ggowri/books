        <h1>Chapter 379 Give Yourself 100 Slaps</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Randy beaten up by Marcus, Grace became worried and tried to intervene. "Mr. Fitzgerald, maybe we should just leave it. Randy is one of the Deleon family. His father is the mayor of Solaria, and their family connections are vast. We'd better not provoke them. I don't want to get you involved."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After hearing Grace's words, Randy licked his lips and showed a hint of pride. "Did you hear that? I'm someone you can't afford to offend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You're so arrogant, huh? Today, if I don't kill you, I won't keep my last name!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Saying that Randy stood up without Marcus' permission.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bang!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus kicked Randy in the stomach, making him scream in pain and curl up on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I don't care who you are. If you offend me, even if you're God's son, I won't tolerate you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, Marcus approached Randy again, grabbed his wrist, and pressed one of his hands to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He pulled out a dagger and asked, "I'm asking you one more time. Will you apologize to Grace? If you don't, I'll leave this hand here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, Marcus pressed the dagger against Randy's wrist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Blood seeped from his wrist, and Randy was instantly taken aback with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He never expected this guy in front of him to be serious. "I'm sorry...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Grace, I'm sorry. I didn't mean what I said about you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even as he spoke, Randy still looked reluctant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus kicked him hard and said, "Show some sincerity!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy winced in pain and repeated his apology. Although his tone was much more sincere, it still didn't seem to satisfy Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' dagger plunged deeper, making Randy feel the sharpness of the blade. It looked like his wrist was about to be cut off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy's last bit of resistance was completely broken. When he started apologizing to Grace, his voice had a slight tremor of crying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Is this enough?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy asked Marcus with a hint of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It's enough, but if you want to leave, give yourself 100 slaps first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy was furious. "You're going too far!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you keep talking, it won't just be about 100 slaps!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus waved his dagger in front of Randy's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy trembled with fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He actually knelt down to start slapping himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Hit harder!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus' voice made Randy shake again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had no choice but to hit harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Slap, slap, slap...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The loud sound of slaps kept ringing out. Randy's face swelled up quickly and soon lost its original look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His friends watching the scene were stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They wondered when someone like Randy had ever been bullied like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Many people on both sides of the street stopped to watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Some even took pictures with their phones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After a long time, Randy finally finished his 100 slaps. His face was covered in blood, and he had lost several teeth. He looked miserable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In a muffled voice, he asked Marcus, "Is this enough now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus waved his hands. "Get lost. If I ever hear you harass Grace again, I'll cut off your hands!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing Marcus' words, Randy's friends came to help him up and hurriedly left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you have the guts, don't leave. Wait here for me. If I'm not letting you pay 10 times today, I'm not a Deleon anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Randy growled, his hatred for Marcus reaching its peak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, you should go now. Randy will find someone soon. His family has influence in Solomia, and I heard his cousin Oliver, the Battle God, is on a mission there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If they come to take revenge, it could cause unnecessary trouble for you, Mr. Fitzgerald."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Randy say this, Grace worriedly tried to stop him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She feared Marcus would get the worse end in front of Randy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Don't listen to him. I'll take you home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus waved his hand, indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>What surprised him was that Randy was actually Oliver's cousin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Oliver was honest and dedicated to the country, with exceptional combat skills, truly deserving the title of Battle God.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But his cousin was a genuine playboy, completely different from Oliver. They were like night and day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>If Grace hadn't introduced them, Marcus would never have connected the two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing Marcus say this, Grace had no choice but to nod in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had planned to go home and tell her parents about the incident, hoping they could help find a way to deal with Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But unexpectedly, Benjamin and his wife weren't home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I'm going home now. You better get back to your own business, or you'll end up dealing with Randy again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Grace reminded Marcus once more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus had no choice but to nod and leave Benjamin's house.</span></p></div>
