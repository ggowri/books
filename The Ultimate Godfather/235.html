  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the red phantom in the rearview mirror, John was in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He envied Edison's driving skills. Even though Edison had retired for many years, he couldn't compare with Edison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just now he was sitting in the passenger seat, marveling at Edison's amazing driving skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Edison </span><span>drove</span><span> as if he were strolling in the garden and easily left the large group behind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In John's opinion, this kind of technology was still the best in the country, and no one in </span><span>Uswad</span><span> could surpass Edison.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, at this moment, the red Ferrari was much faster than them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edison's eyes fixed, and he subconsciously looked at the rearview mirror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled and said, "That's interesting. It seems I have met a master!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he also stepped on the accelerator. Pagani was one of the world's three </span><span>top sports car brands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car's price was several times that of a Ferrari 720s.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The acceleration performance was naturally stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With full-throttle acceleration, the speed quickly exceeded 300 miles per hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This speed was on par with a Ferrari 720s, but there was a series of big bends ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edison had no choice but to slow down when turning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his skillful driving skills, his car kept drifting, drawing beautiful arcs on the track.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this kind of cornering technique were broadcast live, it would surely cause the audience to exclaim in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the red Ferrari driven by Marcus seemed to have no intention of slowing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when faced with such a curve, it still drifted through the curve at an average speed of over 260 miles per hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, at a bend, he overtook the Pagani sports car driven by Edison!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You surpassed! Mr. Fitzgerald, you surpassed Edison, you are amazing!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Melina, who was sitting in the passenger seat, was so excited that she couldn't speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before this, when John proposed the conditions, she thought she could never achieve it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Marcus relied on his almost abnormal driving skills to directly surpass the three-time Dakar Rally champion Edison!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, in the first half of the race, Marcus had been getting familiar with the driving feel of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, he was always at the end of all the cars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even so, he could still overtake in adversity, and the gap was getting wider and wider!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After surpassing Edison, Marcus' car was like a wild horse that had broken free from its reins, and no one could restrain him anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After drifting through several turns, the straight sprint stage was ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus sprinted at full throttle, his speed once soaring to over 400 miles per hour, and he successfully crossed the finish line first without any suspense!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edison won second place, and his charging time was 20 seconds later than Marcus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made John look gloomy, and his heart was filled with shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the last car finished the race, everyone got out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They stared at Marcus blankly in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edison took a step forward and said to Marcus respectfully, "I didn't know you were so excellent. Please don't be offended. I have benefited a lot from this match. It is an honor for me to lose to a master like you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Edison bowed deeply to Marcus, behaving extremely humbly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus waved his hand at Edison and said, "Mr. Park, there is no need to be like this. I am not a professional driver. I am just driving a lap casually."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was telling the truth, but in the eyes of everyone, such words were like a slap in the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially John, whose eyes towards Marcus changed completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> you are an expert. I accept my loss with all my heart!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>John looked at Melina and said, "I lost this time. If you want to quit, I won't stop you. I didn't expect you to find such a master. I wish you all the best!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having said that, John turned around and walked into his Pagani sports car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edison saluted Marcus again and drove away in his Suzuki Hayabusa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others surrounded Marcus with admiration and asked for his autograph.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They finally remembered Marcus said that he would let them see the power of the contemporary car god.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, they all thought that Marcus was bragging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that all this was true!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With such driving skills, if he were to participate in the Dakar Rally, he would win the championship with a huge lead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder Marcus said before that these people were not worthy to be his opponents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that he was not bragging. His driving skills were simply abnormally strong, which exceeded the scope of human control!</span></p><div class="pagination">
