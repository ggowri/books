He presented a pitiable and wretched sight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you so noisy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' voice was icy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite being merely at the Ancient Martial Stage One, Dutton was able to summon a significant number of experts from the Celestial Arc Order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that Marcus had underestimated him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Ancient Martial Stage Four expert from the Celestial Arc Order said coldly, "You slapped my man in front of me. Aren't you too arrogant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite having just stepped into the role of the elder of the sect, he would never allow his subordinates to be beaten in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A person at the peak of Ancient Martial Stage Three said to his companions, "If we don't get rid of this arrogant guy, the Celestial Arc Order will not be able to survive in the world of Ancient Martial Art in Uswad!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were ready to launch a joint attack on Marcus when a wave of overwhelming coercion surged in once more from the void, covering this area of space and plunging everything within it into an atmosphere of extreme depression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone glanced over and saw a beautiful figure in a white gauze dress descending from the void.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly stood in front of Marcus and the members of the Celestial Arc Order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of her shocked the members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, respectful looks came over their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They turned to the beautiful figure and said, "Ms. Wakefield!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The lady was none other than Ada.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada waved gracefully to the members of the Celestial Arc Order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her pure appearance dumbfounded Dutton.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the first time he had seen her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was definitely the most stunning woman he had ever met.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her elegance was far above that of the average woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The expert at the Ancient Martial Stage Four begged, "Ms. Wakefield, this man has ruined the cultivation of one of our fellows. He's incredibly arrogant. Please eliminate this man for him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his opinion, Ada's arrival was equivalent to the appearance of a backbone.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as soon as he had finished speaking, she slapped him across the face, causing him to fall to the ground and wail in agony.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ms. Wakefield, what did I do wrong? Why did you slap me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man was aggrieved and perplexed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada asked, "Tell me, who gave you the permission to come here and stir up trouble?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't I state during the previous sect meeting that no one was permitted to create disturbances outside without my authorization? It appears that you've already forgotten this so soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man instantly broke out in cold sweat and hastily explained, "Ms. Wakefield, one of our sect members was being bullied. That's why I took the initiative to step forward and seek revenge on his behalf."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please show some mercy, Ms. Wakefield!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ada said, "Even if I want to, he might not agree."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, she pointed at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He? He is just a nobody. Why should you care about him, Ms. Wakefield?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dutton and the others were confused, wondering why this matter was related to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, it seemed that Ada was not joking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Listen carefully! If he desires, all of us here, along with the Celestial Arc Order, will be reduced to ashes in the blink of an eye!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Ada finished her words, Dutton and the others were shocked, their eyes full of disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They even assumed that they had misheard. Marcus seemed to be merely in his early twenties. How could he possibly wield such formidable strength?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you still standing there for? Apologize to Mr. Fitzgerald right away, or even I can't protect you!" Ada roared at the sect members.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, she arrived in time this time. Otherwise, they would definitely be killed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dutton and the experts from the Celestial Arc Order were all terrified. How could they hold on any longer? They immediately turned to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone trembled violently, experiencing a sense of soul-deep fear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, our actions were wrong. We had no idea that you were a big shot. We apologize for offending you before and sincerely hope you can forgive us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had actually offended a powerful </span><span>figure</span><span> capable of instantly destroying the Celestial Arc Order. They were simply courting death!</span></p><div class="pagination">
