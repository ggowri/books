  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail smiled and said, "I'm not trying to say much. We were married after all. Is it wrong to say hello?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie glanced at Marcus deeply upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius froze for a moment, then glanced at Marcus and laughed. "Abigail, so this is your ex-husband? Doesn't look like much to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail kept her gaze on Marcus, recalling the scene at the Golden Hotel ballroom. "He's the chairman of Golden Group now, Mr. Andrade. Don't let his looks fool you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius hesitated and asked, "Golden Group? The one in Solomia?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius toned down his condescension and pulled out his phone, opening a search app.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He typed "Golden Group" into the search bar, and the company's details instantly appeared on his screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It included information on the company's legal representatives and key executives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were over twenty names, but Marcus's name wasn't among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Which one of these names is his?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Julius asked Abigail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail scanned the list, the she had a cold smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had approached Marcus to test how he was doing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep down, she didn't want Marcus to be doing better than her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus were still the chairman of Golden Group, Abigail's regret would only deepen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, seeing Julius's search results, Abigail's regret vanished in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face lit up with glee. "Marcus, so you're not the chairman anymore. I thought you'd reached the pinnacle of success, but it seems you were just a flash in the pan!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tone was dripping with schadenfreude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at Abigail, irritation clear in his voice. "What are you trying to say? If you don't have anything important, stop bothering me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail chuckled. "What's wrong? Did my words get to you? You've always been a freeloader in my family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back then, the only reason you became chairman was because you were someone's puppet. Once they were done using you, they kicked you aside. Did you really think you'd live in luxury forever?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail's tone was full of condescension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, she felt immensely satisfied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The resentment she had been harboring poured out at last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Excuse me, miss," Josie said sharply. "Whether my husband is the chairman of Golden Group has nothing to do with you. Even if you're his ex-wife, you're divorced now. Instead of meddling in other people's lives, why not focus on your own?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail finally noticed Josie standing beside Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Realizing that Josie was even more elegant and beautiful than herself, Abigail felt a surge of jealousy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sneered. "And who are you? What does my conversation with my ex-husband have to do with you? Calling him your husband&mdash;are you even married? You'd better shut your mouth!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Josie was momentarily speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was true&mdash;she wasn't married to Marcus. Did she even have the right to call him her husband?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The comment hit a sensitive nerve, sparking an unexpected pang of insecurity in Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail smirked. "See? I was right. You're just a shameless fox. Calling someone your husband without being married&mdash;do you even have any dignity?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail continued coldly, growing more and more offensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, her gaze landed on the limited-edition necklace in the display case, and she was instantly captivated by its design.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Andrade, this necklace is so beautiful. Nine hundred fifty thousand is nothing to you&mdash;I want it," Abigail said, pouting coyly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Julius turned to the saleswoman. "My baby likes this necklace. Wrap it up for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The saleswoman looked awkward and replied, "I'm sorry, sir, but this necklace has already been purchased by this lady."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, the saleswoman glanced at Josie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, both Abigail and Julius froze in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nine hundred fifty thousand, and she had bought it outright.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed this woman had some real power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail's gaze shifted to Marcus as she sneered. "Marcus, I have to hand it to you. You're truly skilled at freeloading. After living off me for three years until I kicked you out, you've now found a rich woman in Kingston. Can you even call yourself a man?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus's expression was filled with disgust. "My life is none of your business. Get out of my sight immediately, or I won't be polite!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Abigail instinctively stepped back, her eyes wary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Marcus had been dismissed from Golden Group, she was still intimidated by his physical strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ignoring the saleswoman's explanation, Julius said forcefully, "I don't care. Abigail wants this necklace, so it belongs to her. Nine hundred fifty thousand, right? I'll give you a million!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
