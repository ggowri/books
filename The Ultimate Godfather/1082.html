        <h1>Chapter 973 Devastating Force-2</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as time passed, Garrick slowly realized that he had severely underestimated Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even under the relentless assault of over fifty people, Marcus remained unfazed. He moved through the fight like a predator among prey, each strike landing with precision. Every time he attacked, someone went down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, even with their overwhelming numbers, his enemies couldn't land a single clean hit on him. Marcus weaved through the chaos effortlessly, his movements swift and controlled, like a master at work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the moment the fight started, not a single one of the fifty attackers had even touched the hem of Marcus' clothes. In less than ten seconds, seven or eight men had already been taken out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the fight continued, the number of fallen fighters increased at an alarming rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, a series of heavy thuds echoed through the air, accompanied by agonized screams. In less than a minute, all fifty men lay sprawled on the ground&mdash;some with broken limbs, others barely conscious, their fate uncertain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire crowd stood in stunned silence, unable to process what they had just witnessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had ever seen someone fight like this before. It was like a scene straight out of an action movie, each movement precise, every strike landing with devastating force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">One man, alone, has defeated fifty armed fighters. It's almost impossible to believe. And yet, it has happened right in front of our eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana and Nicole were equally shaken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Morgana, in particular, had spent the entire time worrying about Marcus. She had thought that with so many men attacking him, his chances of survival were slim. But now, watching the scene unfold, she finally understood why Marcus had remained so calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Marcus easily took care of all these people. He hasn't been reckless. He has been confident. Not the kind of false bravado that comes from arrogance, but real, unwavering confidence in his own strength. He has known from the start that Garrick and his men aren't a threat to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Garrick and Sebastien, stood frozen in place, their faces drained of color. They had never imagined that the man standing before them could be this terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Garrick's voice trembled as he spoke. "What are you? How can you fight like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus dusted off his sleeves, his expression calm as ever. He looked at Garrick and said, "You're not qualified to know."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Garrick's face twisted with rage. His voice dropped into a cold sneer. "I'll admit, you're strong. But if you think that being a good fighter means you can challenge me, you're dead wrong. </span><br><span>"I'm Garrick, chairman of Faust Properties. My brother, Regis, is the chief of police in Solomia. If I wanted to, I could crush you like an insect with a single phone call. Do you really think you stand a chance against me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that, murmurs spread through the crowd. They had to admit, Marcus was powerful, but power alone wasn't everything. Against someone like Garrick, who had wealth, status, and connections, brute strength could only get him so far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Garrick chose to use his influence&mdash;whether through Faust Properties or his brother's authority&mdash;Marcus would still have to face the consequences of what he had done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just when everyone thought Marcus wasn't as big a deal as Garrick, Marcus asked, "You think being the chairman of Faust Properties makes you untouchable?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Garrick's expression hardened. A cold smirk appeared on his face. "Kid, I don't think you understand who you're dealing with. Have you even heard of Faust Properties?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're a billion-dollar company. In Solomia's real estate market, we hold one of the top positions. I personally rank in the top twenty of Solomia's wealthiest individuals. You don't have to take my word for it&mdash;the numbers speak for themselves."</span></p></div>
