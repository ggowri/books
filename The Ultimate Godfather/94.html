        <h1>Chapter 93 A Decent Job</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, Christine, look! Isn't that Marcus driving? I heard his wife cheated on him and he got kicked out of the Winchester family. Looks like he's resorted to being a chauffeur!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Louise and Christine instantly relaxed, a wave of smug satisfaction washing over them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well!" Louise clucked her tongue. "A man without dignity will never amount to anything. He had a perfectly good life, but chose to be a live-in husband. What a disgrace to the Lewis family!" Samuel sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Marcus had parked the car in the courtyard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Richard and his family stepped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three sisters, who hadn't seen each other for almost half a year, exchanged pleasantries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to Marcus, they all wore masks, except for his adoptive mother, Melinda.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their words, even their expressions, seemed fake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't understand why there was such a difference between blood sisters.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His adoptive mother, Melinda, was kind and down-to-earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Christine, although decent enough, was quite snobbish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Louise, the eldest, was the worst of all. Not only did she lack any sense of familial affection, but she constantly badmouthed Melinda behind her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were up to Marcus, he wouldn't have attended this wedding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Melinda, valuing family ties, insisted on coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Melinda," Louise asked, her voice dripping with feigned concern, "where are you coming from? And how did you get a car?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We moved to Solomia a month ago for Nicole's college," Melinda explained with a smile. Seeing her father and two older sisters filled her with joy. "We couldn't get train tickets, so Marcus drove us back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You moved to Solomia? Did you buy a house?" Louise asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had a competitive streak and couldn't stand the thought of others doing better than her, so she'd been grilling Melinda with questions since they arrived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Louise, you know Melinda's family situation!" Christine jumped in. "Solomia's housing prices are sky-high. There's no way they could afford to buy there. They must be renting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Makes sense," Louise replied, feeling a sense of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Jessica's husband, who worked in construction, couldn't afford a decent place in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of Melinda's family owning a home there would have been unbearable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aunt Melinda, Uncle Richard, Marcus, Nicole, come on in! The food's getting cold!" Jessica urged, inviting them into the house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as everyone settled down, the roar of a powerful engine grew closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Toyota Land Cruiser pulled into the courtyard, and a man with tanned skin and tattoos covering his arms stepped out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Samuel was the first to react, rising to his feet with excitement. "Jessica, Paul's back! Hurry and go greet him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jessica's face lit up with a happy smile as she heard her husband had arrived. She rushed out to meet him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul Baker, with his buzz-cut and streetwise demeanor, was a well-known figure in Yolanda Village.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had spent years working construction in Solomia and recently purchased a five-million-dollar house there to serve as his and Jessica's marital home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a source of envy for many in the village.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, let me introduce you. This is Aunt Melinda, Uncle Richard, my cousin Marcus, and my cousin Nicole," Jessica said to Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Paul gave Melinda's family a haughty once-over before quickly dismissing them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He offered a casual greeting and sat down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jessica had already told him about her relatives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were just ordinary farmers, not worth his attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only one who caught his eye was Nicole, who had just come of age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Young girls were nice; she was undoubtedly fresh, much better than his wife Jessica!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Melinda, look how successful Jessica is! She found such a good husband. Paul makes two to three million a year working construction in Solomia, and he even knows that wealthy big boss!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My son, Henry, got a job in the city thanks to Paul. Five thousand dollars a month, with full benefits!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus is divorced, and being a driver for someone else isn't a real career. You should ask Louise if Paul can help him find a job.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're sisters! She'll definitely agree."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Christine turned to Melinda, seemingly struggling to find the right words to praise Paul.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Melinda, I know your family has been struggling these past few years, but you never said a word to me about it. Now that Jessica has found a good husband, our family is on the rise, and we certainly won't forget about you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Louise chimed in, also addressing Melinda, before shifting her attention to Marcus with a disapproving frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, honestly, you have no sense of awareness! Your brother is here, and you don't even bother to greet him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Quick, pour Paul a glass of wine and apologize. If you get on his good side, maybe he'll hook you up with a decent job. Wouldn't that be better than chauffeuring people around?"</span></p></div>
