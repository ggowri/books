  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus immediately understood what they meant and stretched out his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sneering, the two men handcuffed Marcus' hands and blindfolded him, taking him into the vast mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mountain road was rugged. After passing through several dangerous places, they finally arrived at a manor that looked highly primitive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything in the manor was made of wood and was isolated from the world in the mountains.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was blindfolded, but he had practiced the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, and his perception was much sharper than that of ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He activated his Numinous Energy with all his strength, and the images around him appeared in his mind then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was brought into the manor by the two men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The manor was heavily guarded, with a guard every five steps. Every man was carrying a gun and was fully armed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an open courtyard, Natalia was tied to a stone pillar with iron chains, and her body was covered with bruises.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A young man, wearing gorgeous clothes and holding an M16 submachine gun, sat on a chair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it turned out to be Leo, who had already returned to Kingston.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take his blindfold off." Seeing Marcus being brought here, Leo sneered and gave instructions to his two servants.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before coming here, Marcus had some guesses in his mind. But he hadn't expected that he would be right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Country bumpkin, I never thought you would actually take the bait for a woman," said Leo with a smug look, playing with the M16 submachine gun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What had happened to him in Solomia nightclub a week ago was still vivid in Leo's mind. It was the shame of his life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After returning to Kingston, he began to use all his strength to investigate Marcus and finally targeted Natalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo had successfully taken Natalia away with just a little trickery to catch Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, don't worry about me. Just run. It will be too late if you don't run now." Seeing Marcus, Natalia could no longer suppress her inner grievances, and tears flowed down her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, "I can die, but I don't want to implicate Marcus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Silly girl, I won't let anything happen to you." Seeing Natalia being tortured beyond recognition, Marcus felt angry, and a strong sense of hatred surged in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think you can still get away?" Leo's eyes were full of sneer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he actually stood up and walked to Marcus, trying to slap Marcus' face and laughing. "I will torture you to death bit by bit, and then send that girl to a brothel to be ravaged by different customers every day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as Leo finished speaking, Marcus broke the handcuffs, with one hand suddenly clasping Leo's throat and the other hand taking the M16 submachine gun in Leo's hand away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo was horrified. He had never expected that Marcus' strength was so abnormal that he could even break the handcuffs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost at the same time, intensive gunfire rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus pushed Leo away and dodged the bullet attack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After being rescued, Leo fled backward in a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus turned around, quickly raised his submachine gun, and fired fiercely at a firing point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The M16 submachine gun had strong firepower and extreme penetrating power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Combined with Marcus' super eyesight and control of timing, all the people at that firing point were killed after a burst of gunfire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kill him." roared Leo at his men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had never thought that Marcus, whose wrist was cuffed, still could fight back and thought, "If I had known this would happen, I would have shot this country bumpkin dead at the beginning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Accompanied by Leo's order, dozens of guns were fired at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These people were all well-trained retired special forces soldiers or mercenaries hired from abroad at high prices.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's military quality was extremely terrifying, and their shooting accuracy was far beyond ordinary people's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Intense bullets were fired at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Seeing this, Natalia shouted, "Marcus, be careful."</span></p><div class="pagination">
