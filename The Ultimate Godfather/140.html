  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said, "My car broke down and was just towed away. I'm waiting for a taxi to the dealership to buy a new one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine nodded, glanced at Thomas in the driver's seat, and asked, "Thomas, aren't you going back to the center of Solomia later? Will you give Mr. Fitzgerald a ride? Thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was very polite.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laura's cancer had been cured by Marcus, and she should have been discharged from the hospital in seven days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Catherine wanted Laura to stay for a few more days so that she could recover more completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, Laura was released from the hospital. As Catherine's classmate, Thomas volunteered to drive them home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at Marcus with a half-smile and asked, "Which dealership are you going to, Mr. Fitzgerald?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied, "Aston Martin dealership."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas was stunned. Wasn't that his dream car?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it cost several million dollars, and he couldn't afford it with his salary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was why he bought the Mercedes-Benz with the help of his parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in Thomas' opinion, he had already surpassed most of his peers by purchasing a Mercedes-Benz at his age.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, the car gave him a sense of condescension.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aston Martin? Are you sure?" Thomas asked, somewhat incredulous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Marcus' medical skills were indeed very impressive, Thomas didn't believe that Marcus was rich. After all, the car was too expensive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus raised his eyebrows, not knowing what Thomas meant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas smiled, "I don't mean anything else. What make of your broken car is, Mr. Fitzgerald?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied nonchalantly, "Volkswagen Bora."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas burst out laughing and said sarcastically, "You drove a Volkswagen Bora before, but now, you want an Aston Martin. Isn't the price gap too big?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus asked, "Why, is there any problem?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas chuckled, "Mr. Fitzgerald, you should be more realistic. If your Volkswagen Bora is broken, try to fix it, or just replace it with a Volkswagen Jetta or something. No one will laugh at you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no need to boast about buying a luxury car just to save face. It's really boring!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas' words annoyed Catherine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus easily bought a villa worth 80 million dollars at Cedars Villas, so a sports car worth several million dollars would not be a problem for him at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, he was the chairman of the Golden Group, and his net worth was at least tens of billions of dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he never let Catherine reveal his identity, so she could only endure it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas continued, "For example, despite my fondness for Aston Martin, I am self-aware. I am just an ordinary doctor and may not make that much money in my lifetime. So I opted for a Mercedes-Benz, which makes me feel very grounded now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want a luxury car, too, try your best and stop daydreaming. After all, your medical skills are pretty good. With hard work, you might afford a Mercedes-Benz."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking that Thomas was going too far, Catherine couldn't help but say, "Thomas, Mr. Fitzgerald has his own plans. Stay out of it. The front passenger seat is empty. Can you give Mr. Fitzgerald a ride?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more Catherine sided with Marcus, the stronger Thomas' hatred for him became.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Last time, in the hospital, Marcus stole the limelight and completely outshone him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Catherine admired him very much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Laura was hospitalized, Thomas often heard Catherine praising Marcus to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her admiration for Marcus stung Thomas like a thorn. He was left with nowhere to vent his anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bumped into Marcus today and subconsciously wanted to insult him. "Catherine, I'm really sorry. I just washed the car yesterday, so it's not convenient for me to give him a ride."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas stepped on the accelerator, and the car sped away, raising a large cloud of dust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine in the back seat glared at him fiercely. If she had known that he was mean, she would definitely not have agreed to ride in his car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly opened her phone and sent a WhatsApp message to Marcus. [Mr. Fitzgerald, don't be angry. Thomas is petty. Don't bother with him.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied: [It's okay. I don't take him seriously at all, so I am not angry.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine replied: [Mr. Fitzgerald, you are forgiving.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>[Oh, by the way, my mother wants to invite you to our house to thank you for saving her life. Mr. Fitzgerald, when will you be free?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus replied: [It's just a small favor. No need to thank me.]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine stressed: [No way. My mother has threatened to beat me to death if I fail to invite you!]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The message was followed by a cute emoji with a tongue sticking out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had no choice but to agree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since there was nothing else to do today, he set the time at seven o'clock tonight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That was when he took the car.&#8203;</span></p><div class="pagination">
