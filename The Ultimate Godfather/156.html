        <h1>Chapter 155 Master and the Muse</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First of all, when you said you'd teach me earlier, I never agreed to it. Second, who I choose to learn from is entirely up to me. Mr. Murphy, I don't think that's any of your business," Maxine said with a frown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward, her instructor, had always left a good impression on her. She genuinely appreciated his patient guidance over the past three years. But lately, something had changed. He seemed like a completely different person&mdash;someone she hardly recognized, someone who even annoyed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward's gaze turned icy, his lips curling into a cold smirk. "Fine. Very well said. Clearly, I've been too eager, chasing after someone who doesn't care. Go ahead, reject your instructor, and learn from whoever you want. But tomorrow, I can't wait to see what kind of results you bring back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Edward spoke, his eyes shifted toward Marcus, his tone sharpening. "And don't forget&mdash;tomorrow, at the </span><span>Harrowfell</span><span> Invitational, I'll face you in the ring. I'll make sure to defeat you in front of everyone." With that, Edward turned and walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, unfazed, maintained his usual calm demeanor, paying Edward no mind. Maxine, however, felt a twinge of guilt. She gave Marcus an apologetic smile and said, "Sorry about that, Marcus. Mr. Murphy tends to get carried away, but he's actually a decent guy. I hope you don't take it to heart."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shrugged casually. "Don't worry about it. I don't mind. Besides, we're practically strangers. The only reason we're even crossing paths is because of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine nodded and then tilted her head up to look at him. "Are you coming to the invitational tomorrow?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus shook his head. "Not interested."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A flicker of disappointment crossed Maxine's bright eyes. "You really don't want to see the results of what you've taught me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words were subtle, but Marcus caught the meaning behind them instantly. A small </span><span>smile played on his lips. "If you want me to watch, I'll try to make time. After all, you're kind of my half-student, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's competitive streak flared as she huffed, "Who wants to be your student? But... I'd still like you to come. Don't worry about Mr. Murphy&mdash;I'll handle him myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she looked exactly like a determined student eager to earn her teacher's approval. This was the first time she'd willingly set aside her pride to ask Marcus for guidance in combat techniques. She couldn't wait to show him what she'd achieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled, "Well, since Officer Burnett herself is inviting me, how could I refuse?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After bidding farewell to Maxine, Marcus returned to Bayside Villa. As soon as he entered his room, he noticed several unfamiliar and peculiar items scattered around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane had surprisingly dressed in an all-black dominatrix outfit, looking like something straight out of an adult film. Black stockings, curvy hips, a full chest, and the tantalizingly mysterious area near her thighs were faintly visible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, you're finally back." She was overjoyed to see </span><span>Marcus</span><span> return. Pointing at the odd assortment of items on the bed, she smiled and said, "Honey, can we try these today? I saw what you did with Natalia last time, and I want you to do the same with me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus took a closer look and realized the bed was covered with items specifically used for SM activities&mdash;chains, whips, handcuffs, everything one might expect. He thought, "Jane is getting bolder and more outrageous by the day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Marcus didn't respond for a while, Jane shook his arm playfully and said in a soft, coquettish voice, "Honey, what do you think? I missed you so much and want you to whip me. Whip me hard." As she spoke, she picked up a whip and handed it to him. Then she knelt on the bed, arching her ass up, making the outline of the mysterious area even more visible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the atmosphere so charged, Marcus couldn't hold back any longer. He grabbed the whip and brought it down with a firm snap&mdash;snap. Her body quivered under the impact, a delicate, seductive moan escaping as she seemed completely lost in the pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whip me, Honey, please. Don't hold back," Jane murmured, her body shifting enticingly. Her movements caused her juicy breasts to sway, and her pink nipples revealed just enough to leave a striking impression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really are something else, aren't you?" Marcus teased, his hand striking with even more force as the whip cracked against her skin again and again. Jane's reaction was one of pure exhilaration, her voice rising with each strike, her body trembling as a telltale dampness darkened her stockings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh my god, it's amazing... I feel so good, Honey... No wonder Natalia enjoys it so much... I guess I'm just like her... I love it when you're rough, love it when you take charge..." Jane moaned, her words spilling out shamelessly.</span></p></div>
