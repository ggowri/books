  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice of a man named Troy Stevens echoed from the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boom!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leif Leonard froze like he'd been hit by a freight train. His body stiffened, and his face twisted with shock and dread.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Stevens, please, just hear me out! I've been with Sync Group for years&mdash;years! I've worked my tail off. I might not be the best, but I've given it everything I've got!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm begging you&mdash;don't do this! I've got an elderly mother to look after and a newborn at home!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice cracked with desperation, but Troy wasn't having it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Orders from above," Troy said flatly. "Nothing I can do about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Click. The call ended before Leif could get another word in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leif crumpled to the ground. His eyes stared blankly into the distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Honey, what's going on? What happened?" asked a middle-aged woman, concern written all over her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Stephen Andrade just got fired, and now everyone he put in place is being dragged down with him. They've canned us all!" Leif's voice shook as he spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words hit like a grenade. Everyone in the room froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gloria Hope and the female interviewer's eyes went wide in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stephen Andrade was fired? For real?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could Marcus Fitzgerald actually be someone important?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That didn't make any sense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The female interviewer glanced at Leif, her eyes narrowing as if she'd figured something out. "Honey, don't lose your mind over one phone call. I'm telling you, that guy on the phone was probably just some actor this punk hired to freak you out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I mean, come on&mdash;if he's really on Sync Group's board, you'd know him, right? You've been with the company for years!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words lit a spark in Leif's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He blinked a few times, his expression shifting from despair to realization. "Ha! You almost got me, you little punk," Leif sneered. "Not bad, I'll give you that. But hiring some two-bit actor to scare me? Nah, that's not gonna fly, kid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He squared his shoulders and started walking toward Marcus with slow, deliberate steps, eyes locked on him like a predator stalking its prey.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as he closed in, his phone buzzed in his pocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leif glanced at the screen. The name Stephen Andrade popped up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What came next was a storm of rage. "Leif! You stupid son of a&mdash;! Of all the people to tick off, you had to pick Mr. Fitzgerald?! Are you out of your mind?! You've ruined me! I was doing just fine as president, and now I'm fired!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'd better stay put, Leif, because I'm coming for you. I swear, I'll break both your arms myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leif Leonard was hit with a verbal barrage from Stephen Andrade, the harsh words cutting straight to his core.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened his mouth to respond, but before he could get a word in, the call ended with a sharp click.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, he'd dismissed the call from Troy Stevens. Unknown number, unfamiliar voice&mdash;probably just a stunt pulled by Marcus to mess with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this time, it was Stephen Andrade's name on the screen. A number saved in his contacts. There was no mistaking it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization hit him hard&mdash;Stephen really had been fired. And the man responsible? The plain-looking guy standing right in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No... no way. How do you have the authority to fire Mr. Andrade?! Who the hell even are you?!" Leif's voice shook as his words spilled out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes stayed locked on Marcus, filled with a mix of confusion and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Leif had taken the call on speaker, everyone nearby heard it&mdash;the middle-aged female interviewer, Gloria, and a few others close enough to catch the conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their expressions stiffened, eyes darting between Leif and Marcus like they'd just witnessed something unreal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nobody would have believed that one phone call from this unassuming young man could topple someone like Stephen Andrade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The weight of it all settled on the room like a heavy fog, leaving the crowd quiet and uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Catherine's eyes lingered on Marcus, her face unreadable but her gaze sharper than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just a moment ago, she was worried Marcus might be overstepping in his clash with Sync Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, it was obvious&mdash;Marcus had the power to decide who stayed and who got shown the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You? Know who I am? Not in your wildest dreams," Marcus said with a cold glance, his voice sharp and firm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave Leif a brief, condescending look, then turned his eyes away like he had more important matters on his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leif's face twisted in anger, his hands balling into fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't clawed his way up to branch manager just to have it all ripped away in one afternoon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was supposed to be the reward for his years of effort&mdash;and now it was gone, shattered in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He glanced briefly toward his wife and niece, but his blame didn't shift to them. No, it all zeroed in on Marcus Fitzgerald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't care who you are. You cut off my paycheck, and I'll make sure you pay for it. I'll take you down if it's the last thing I do!" Leif barked, his teeth clenched tight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The longer he stood there, the hotter his anger grew, boiling over until he couldn't think straight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes landed on a chair nearby. Without a second thought, he grabbed it and charged straight at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd gasped, eyes fixed on Leif, stunned to see a man who once carried himself as a manager lose control like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bang!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before Leif could even get close, Marcus delivered a swift kick and sent him flying backward, landing with a painful cry!</span></p><div class="pagination">
