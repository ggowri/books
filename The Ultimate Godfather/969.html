  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His frown deepened, and he said, "I heard that you two have been occupying someone else's property and refusing to leave, and that you used violence. Is that true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiera replied, "She was unreasonable, demanding that I vacate the room and refusing to return my deposit. On top of that, she insulted me, accusing me of being involved in prostitution. My boyfriend couldn't stand her behavior, so he stepped in to defend me. And before that, she had pushed me. Based on that, my boyfriend's actions should count as self-defense!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kiera's reasoning was sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The neighbors agreed with her account of the events.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, none of them dared to speak up in support of her and Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Dexter was Helen's husband, and they all knew he had come with the police to back her up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they stood up for Kiera and Marcus, Dexter, as the deputy police chief, would hold a grudge and might seek revenge&mdash;and they couldn't afford that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no such thing as self-defense," Dexter sneered. "My wife didn't hurt you, but this guy left her face red and swollen. This is considered simple assault, and under Uswad law, it could carry a sentence of 1 to 3 years in prison!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dexter, of all people, was lecturing Marcus and Kiera about the law.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To the neighbors, it was obvious that he was laying the groundwork to arrest them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they were formally charged, he could easily make an arrest and press charges.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus let out a cold laugh. "You? You really think you're in a position to lecture me about the law?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dexter froze for a moment, clearly taken aback by Marcus's calm and unbothered demeanor in the face of his intimidation, and by the fact that Marcus even had the nerve to retort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This simply showed that he didn't take Dexter, the deputy police chief, seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm the deputy chief of the police precinct in this area. Of course, I have the right to talk about the law. But you? Do you even understand the law?" Dexter retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked at him with a mocking, cold expression. "You really want to talk about the law? Then explain to me how taking bribes, abusing your power, and helping criminals fit within the law. Or are you just breaking it on purpose?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At these words, everyone in the room froze, stunned by Marcus's boldness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected him to openly criticize the deputy chief of the police precinct for illegal activities right in front of everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Dexter's corrupt activities were well-known, no one dared to bring them up in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They all knew that he wasn't just some local official&mdash;he had connections in the city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without them, he wouldn't have been able to secure his position or ride roughshod over the law for so many years without facing consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dexter was taken aback by Marcus's audacity. His face darkened as he sneered, "I've broken the law on purpose? That's outright slander. Slander against a police officer is a serious crime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Coupled with your previous assault on my wife, you could easily be looking at 8 to 10 years in prison!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus showed no sign of fear. With a cold, indifferent tone, he said, "If I'm saying this, I have the proof to back it up. Don't believe me? Take a look at this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He unlocked his phone and opened an email from Amelia that had just come in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The document contained a detailed list of Dexter's crimes committed during his tenure as deputy chief of the police precinct in this area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Amelia had gathered all the evidence in less than half an hour. As a trusted aide to Benjamin, she was indeed very efficient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Dexter furrowed his brow and leaned in to closely examine the document on Marcus's phone. His face immediately turned ashen with disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where did you get this document? This is legally invalid. I suspect it's all fabricated. I'll have to take you to the police station and interrogate you properly, or you'll never admit to it!" Dexter said, trying to maintain his composure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason he wanted to bring Marcus to the police station was clear&mdash;he wanted to seize the document and destroy it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police station was his turf, and once Marcus was in his custody, he wasn't worried about making him talk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a veteran officer with over 20 years of experience, Dexter had his own methods of extracting confessions from suspects.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a round of interrogation, even the most stubbornest person wouldn't be able to hold out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Dexter's subordinates moved into position. The officers quickly surrounded Marcus, trapping him in the center.</span></p><div class="pagination">
