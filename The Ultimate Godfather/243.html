  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Marcus' serious tone sank in, Diana took a moment to reflect. "To be honest, Mr. Fitzgerald, I don't usually notice anything like this when I'm not close to you. I hardly ever experience it otherwise, so I've never paid attention. But now that you mention it, there really is a faint scent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Do you know what that means?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus answered with a sly grin. "It means you're one of a kind. Once I've been with you, I'd never be able to get enough&mdash;you'd have me completely under your spell."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're such a liar!" Diana huffed, glaring at him. "If I sleep with you, would you really give up all those other women? Of course not!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her sharp words, the compliment warmed her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but feel a little pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the car pulled into the driveway of a villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the yard, Jane was mid-workout, dressed in a curve-hugging yoga outfit that accentuated her full figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her ample chest strained against the fabric as if threatening to burst free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mar&mdash;Marcus, you're back!" she called out, pausing her exercise and jogging over to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had started to call him "husband" but quickly corrected herself when she noticed Diana nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana noticed Jane's calculated move and couldn't help but roll her eyes internally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What an act!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She recalled the nights she'd heard Jane in the adjacent room, shouting Marcus' name with abandon&mdash;things like, Harder, Marcus! Don't </span><span>stop!&mdash;</span><span>words that left Diana blushing in bed. Now here Jane was, playing the innocent. Oblivious to Diana's thoughts, Marcus nodded at Jane before retrieving two gift boxes from his luggage. He handed one to each of them. "I wasn't sure what to get while I was in Kingston, so I picked up these limited-edition Van Cleef &amp; Arpels necklaces."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana and Jane's eyes lit up as they eagerly opened the boxes. Women love surprises, and these two were no exception. Knowing that Marcus had thought of them while he was away filled them with warmth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The necklaces, worth 490,000 dollars each, were nothing extravagant for Marcus these days, but he'd still stood in line for hours to secure them. It was a thoughtful gesture, and both women were overjoyed. They quickly tried them on, admiring their reflections and each other's necklaces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After settling in, Marcus headed upstairs to drop off his luggage and take a quick shower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to relax, his phone rang.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing it was his adoptive father, Richard, he answered immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, Dad. What's up?" Marcus asked, feeling a twinge of guilt. He realized it had been nearly a month since he'd visited his adoptive parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's nothing big," Richard replied. "Your sister has a parent-teacher conference, and your mom and I aren't really sure what to say. We were hoping you could go instead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus picked up on a note of hesitation in Richard's voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His parents had spent their whole lives in the countryside and weren't comfortable navigating the formalities of a city school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus felt a pang of regret and immediately agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His sister, Nicole, had just started high school, and attending her parent-teacher conference was important.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially since she was now at Solomia High, a prestigious school where students excelled academically. In today's competitive education landscape, Marcus knew how much effort&mdash;and money&mdash;went into ensuring a child's success. Nicole, being one of the few students from a rural background, stood out in her class of mostly children from elite families. Most of her peers had parents who were business owners, government officials, or other professionals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The conference was scheduled for 1 PM, so Marcus took some time to rest before heading out in his Aston Martin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By then, Nicole had already been released from school for the day, so he didn't get a chance to see her before arriving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Solomia High was located in the busiest part of the city, and the conference caused a traffic jam.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The school's parking lot was already full, so Marcus found a nearby paid lot and walked back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he arrived at the classroom at 12:50 PM, the other parents were already seated, sitting upright as if they were attending an important board meeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you Nicole's guardian?" a stern-looking teacher in her thirties asked, her tone cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm her brother," Marcus replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The teacher pointed to a seat in the back corner. "That's your spot. Next time, make sure to arrive earlier. Don't keep the other parents waiting."</span></p><div class="pagination">
