She never anticipated that in her moment of crisis, the first to save her would be Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What the hell do you think you're doing? You think you can be a hero? How naive!" one of the hijackers sneered, swiveling his gun to aim directly at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the hijacker preparing to shoot, Maxine shouted sharply, "This is none of your business! Sit down and shut up right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus cast Maxine a reassuring glance before turning to face the hijacker. "I'm giving you one last chance. Let her go, or I promise I'll kill that guy before you can pull the trigger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Marcus pointed at the hijacker threatening Maxine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hijackers were momentarily taken aback, then exchanged sarcastic smirks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them scoffed, "Who do you think you are, Superman? How dare you talk so big? What an idiot!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boss, this guy's a lunatic. Let's ignore him and have some fun with this girl!" another hijacker chimed in, clearly impatient and eager to ignore Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hijacker holding Maxine nodded in agreement and reached out to tear her clothes off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could lay a finger on her, a rush of air surged past him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a flash, Marcus was standing right in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hijacker's eyes widened in terror as he raised his gun to shoot, but Marcus had already seized his neck and twisted hard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sickening crack echoed, and before the hijacker could react, his body slumped lifelessly to the ground, his eyes wide as if trying to utter a final word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That guy just killed the Boss! Shoot him!" one of the remaining hijackers shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others sprang into action, drawing their guns and aiming at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Maxine, now free, had already taken charge. She swiftly grabbed the pistol from the floor and fired without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two gunshots rang out, the bullets finding their mark in the foreheads of two hijackers, ending their lives instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another hijacker aimed at Maxine, but Marcus stepped in, grabbed a knife from the table, and slashed the hijacker's throat in one clean motion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Within moments, all the hijackers lay dead at the hands of Marcus and Maxine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of thunderous applause erupted in the cabin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Passengers cheered, their eyes filled with gratitude as they looked at Marcus and Maxine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We are saved! We are saved!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you so much! You are true heroes!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many expressed their heartfelt thanks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Marcus and Maxine hadn't been there, none of th</span><span>em</span><span> would have made it out alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, the captain and crew approached Marcus and Maxine, offering their profound gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In recognition of their bravery, the crew arranged for Marcus and Maxine to enjoy the highest-standard first-class accommodations&mdash;completely complimentary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine, ever the professional, quickly collected the belongings of the dead hijackers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To their shock, they discovered that these hijackers were actually members of a foreign mercenary group known as the Black Hawk Legion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was notorious for carrying out terrorist attacks worldwide&mdash;airplane hijackings, bank robberies, and kidnapping high-profile individuals had become their trademarks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, today, a few mercenaries from the Black Hawk Legion had targeted this flight.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After wrapping up her work, Maxine took a deep breath and approached Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her expression had shifted from disdain to one of gratitude and respect. "Thank you. I couldn't have taken down those hijackers without your help!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smiled, "Thank you for always thinking about my safety in a crisis."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine replied, "That's my job. It's my duty to protect every citizen of Uswad. There's no need for thanks. If you want to show gratitude, give it to the Uswad Special Police Force!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, as if recalling something important, she added, "By the way, what's your name? Share your contact info with me. I'll put in a request for a special recognition for you when I get back to the academy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus had shown incredible courage, taking out two hijackers all by himself. That kind of bravery deserved recognition and a fast track up the ladder.</span></p><div class="pagination">
