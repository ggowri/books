  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the dinner ended, Haley left Charles' house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He muttered, "That damn Marcus! Not only did he humiliate me today, but he also caused TreatMed Pharmaceuticals to suffer massive losses. I'll make him pay dearly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting in the back seat of his Rolls-Royce Phantom, Haley dialed a number. "Hello, Bob? It's me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A gruff voice answered on the other end, "Mr. Brown, you're a busy man. What brings you to me today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haley's eyes gleamed with malice. "I need you to cripple someone's arms. Name your price."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob chuckled darkly, "For you, Mr. Brown, my old client, I'll give you a discount. One million dollars."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hiring someone for such a job started at half a million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Haley's targets were always prominent figures, so the prices were steep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Done. He shouldn't have gone far. Move out now, and I'll wire the money when it's done!" Haley agreed without hesitation, ten million dollars was nothing to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only by cutting off Marcus's arm could he assuage his hatred.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he would properly humiliate Yvonne!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the heir to TreatMed Pharmaceuticals, Haley had many eyes and ears in Solomia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, he pinpointed Marcus's location and ordered his driver to follow. At the same time, he told Bob about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus, driving his Alphard minivan, found his path blocked by Haley's convoy in a secluded street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, bumpkin! Get out of the car!" Haley stepped out of his Rolls-Royce, a bloodthirsty grin on his face as he stared down Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calmly, Marcus got out of his car and swept his gaze over Haley's group. "What's the meaning of this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Teaching you a lesson," Haley sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus chuckled, unfazed, "You think you're capable of that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You think I'll dirty my hands?" Haley shot back, stepping aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several black SUVs pulled up, and Bob, accompanied by his men, stepped out. His intimidating presence filled the alley as he addressed Haley. "Mr. Brown, who's the target?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haley pointed at Marcus. "Him! Cut off both his arms and make sure he regrets being alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No problem. Anyone who crosses Mr. Brown doesn't walk away unscathed!" As he spoke, Bob's gaze naturally landed on Marcus. "You're unlucky to have crossed paths with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, he waved his hand at the thugs behind him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bob, long time no see. Looks like you've developed some temper?" However, before the thugs could make a move, Bob heard a familiar voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He squinted his eyes and immediately signaled the thugs to stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The street was dim, and Bob couldn't clearly see Marcus' face at first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon closer inspection, Bob was utterly astounded. "Mr. Fitzgerald, how could it be you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight of Marcus' face sent a buzzing through Bob's head, nearly causing him to faint on the spot!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He vividly recalled the day when Marcus had single-handedly stormed the Cyan Serpent Lodge and slain Tory!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This memory instilled in Bob an ineradicable sense of dread towards Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Marcus's presence, even without a word, Bob couldn't help but tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you here to help him chop off my hands?" Marcus asked with an intrigued tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob's expression collapsed entirely. "I dare not. Mr. Fitzgerald, I would never dare to offend you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Bob began to slap himself fiercely in front of everyone, uttering various apologies as he did so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haley's gaze intensified, his face filled with disbelief. He immediately stepped forward and asked, "Bob, what are you doing? Hurry up and chop off this guy's hands."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob backhanded Haley across the face, furiously declaring, "You son of a bitch, are you trying to get me killed? I'll kill you first!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haley, holding his face in bewilderment, said, "Bob, did you hit the wrong person? The one you should be hitting is that hick over there!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Bob was seething with rage, and seeing Haley's expression fueled his anger. "Shut your damn mouth. It's you I'm hitting!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Bob unleashed a barrage of punches and kicks on Haley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haley, merely a pampered rich kid, was no match for Bob. He quickly found himself on the ground, wailing in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His entourage, terrified, also suffered, getting brutally beaten by the members of Serpent's Coil!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bob, please don't. Let's talk this through. Let's talk this through..." Haley whimpered, pleading for mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Bob stopped when he was exhausted, then turned back to Marcus with a respectful demeanor, asking, "Mr. Fitzgerald, what should we do with this guy?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
