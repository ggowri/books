        <h1>Chapter 417 Unbearable Heartbreak</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus arrived at the door of apartment 403, Building 28.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Just as he was about to knock, he heard shouting from inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Darian, you're a failure! Not only can you not make any money, but now you're dragging my daughter through this mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ever since she married you, it's been one disaster after another. And don't get me started on your genes! Look at the kid&mdash;always sick. Every month, you're shelling out a fortune on hospital bills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"And now this&mdash;borrowing money for a car you didn't even wreck. They've already told you it's fine, but you're still acting like some hero.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I'm taking Ramona with me today! You can stay single for the rest of your life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus hesitated. It didn't feel right to knock with all the yelling going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was about to leave and come back later when, before he could turn around, the door suddenly opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian appeared, surprised to see him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, what brings you here? Don't worry about the remaining 150 thousand dollars&mdash;I'll get it to you soon!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian thought Marcus had come to collect the rest of the money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He looked worn out&mdash;scruffy beard, disheveled clothes&mdash;clearly exhausted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As he spoke, two figures quickly appeared from the apartment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>One was Darian's wife, Ramona, and the other was a middle-aged woman in her fifties, overweight and furious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It was obvious from the conversation that this woman was Darian's mother-in-law, Aniya.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"What did you just say, Darian? You're going to give him 150 thousand dollars? Who does he think he is? Where are you getting that kind of money? You borrowed these 100 thousand dollars from loan sharks, and you're still clueless!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aniya glared at Darian, clearly disgusted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"This is Mr. Fitzgerald. He's the owner of the car I hit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian introduced Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aniya sized up Marcus and then said, "So it's you, huh? What kind of car costs 250,000 just for repairs? I bet you're getting scammed by him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian sighed, visibly frustrated, clearly tired of dealing with his mother-in-law. "Aniya, Mr. Fitzgerald's car cost five to six million dollars new. The damage was serious. 250 thousand for repairs is actually a bargain."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aniya's eyes widened in surprise, and she stared at Marcus for a long moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Figures! You're a walking disaster. Of all the cars you had to hit, it had to be the most expensive one!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She sighed deeply and turned away. "You know what? I don't even care anymore. You're about to divorce Ramona anyway. Your debts are yours to deal with. It has nothing to do with us!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She grabbed Ramona's wrist and started pulling her toward the stairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ramona hesitated, reluctant to leave. She turned to Marcus and said, "Mr. Fitzgerald, I don't agree with all of this, but Darian borrowed money to pay you the 100 thousand dollars. You're doing well for yourself, so can we just call it even on the remaining 150 thousand dollars? After all, raising our son alone will be tough for him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian's face fell. He turned to his wife in despair. "Ramona, are you really going to divorce me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ramona bit her lip, her emotions finally bursting out. "Darian, I still care about you, and I love our son, but I've had enough of this life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"We've been working ourselves to the bone, and it's only getting worse. Every day feels like we're sinking deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"You promised me everything before we got married, but none of it has come true. After the divorce, I'll still see our son and help support him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian's heart sank. "Ramona, I don't know what I've done wrong. I'm working hard every day, but our son was born with a heart condition. That's not something I can fix. You can't blame me for everything!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His face was full of sorrow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian had always prided himself on being strong, but now, facing his wife's and mother-in-law's harsh words, the 25-year-old suddenly felt like an old man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"If you're not to blame, then who is? If it weren't for you, Ramona would've married Director Rollins' son, and her life would've been better. Instead, she's stuck with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Aniya's voice was filled with fury as she tossed a divorce agreement at Darian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Sign it! Once you do, Ramona can marry Yao's son, and everything will be fixed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Darian picked up the divorce papers, his hands trembling as he signed his name, his heart shattering with every stroke.</span></p></div>
