  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia sensed something was off and questioned Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus made a shushing gesture and said, "What woman? I'm just watching TikTok."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh... well, you've been working so hard these past few days. Make sure you get some good rest. I'm going back to bed too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Natalia, seemingly convinced, returned to her room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Diana couldn't help but smile knowingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had noticed Jane sneaking into Marcus's room earlier but had chosen to keep quiet about it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Natalia left, Marcus and Jane finally breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You slut! If Natalia finds out, I'd love to see how you explain yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus smacked Jane's firm, round ass and scolded her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It would've been fine," Jane replied with a moan. "These situations have a way of working themselves out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't believe how brave she was being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus felt a chill run down his spine as he heard Jane's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jane had mentioned before that she wanted to serve Marcus together with Natalia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, Marcus thought she was joking, but her expression now suggested she might actually mean it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of being with two women at once was undeniably thrilling, something he had never experienced before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the idea of Natalia killing him for it quickly snuffed out his bold impulses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead, he pinned Jane beneath him, parted her legs, and entered her...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The following day, Marcus went to Serpent's Coil early in the morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was briefed on the current situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tory's death had indeed had a negative impact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some gangs, no longer intimidated by Tory, were trying to break free from Serpent's Coil's control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recently, Serpent's Coil, led by Bob, Jalen, and others, had deployed a large number of men to suppress these rebellious gangs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had significantly hampered their efforts to expand their territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of this was within Marcus's expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I've disappointed you," Jalen said with an apologetic smile in the Serpent's Coil Hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His arm was bandaged from the battle the day before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edgar and Bob were also present.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If not for his extensive combat experience, he might have lost it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come here!" Marcus beckoned to Jalen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen's face paled, his heart leaping into his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had expected to be punished for his lack of effectiveness, but instead, Marcus took his injured arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a powerful surge of Numinous Energy flowed into Jalen's arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen felt a warm current flow through his arm, and the excruciating pain that had been drilling into him vanished in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In less than three minutes, he could not only move his arm freely, but it also felt solid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Try throwing a punch," Marcus said to Jalen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jalen nodded and threw a punch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The wooden table he hit shattered into pieces!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone stared in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Jalen was a good fighter, he was still an ordinary person. The power of this punch clearly exceeded the limits of any average human.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So strong! How did I suddenly become so powerful? And the injuries on my arm are entirely healed!" Jalen exclaimed, ecstatic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone's hearts trembled once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had witnessed Marcus do all this with their own eyes; it was simply miraculous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They knew how badly Jalen's arm had been injured, how close he had come to losing it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had healed it with seemingly effortless ease. If they hadn't seen it with their own eyes, they wouldn't have believed it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"It is the power of Numinous Energy," Marcus said. "Do you want to possess it?"</span></p><div class="pagination">
