  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas's face flushed a deep red as he was scolded by Charles. "Mr. Miller, don't be angry. I tried explaining it to him, but he insisted on saying the surgery had a low chance of success and that the patient wouldn't make it through the day."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He parroted Marcus's words to Charles, hoping to shift the blame.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mother-daughter cancer cell? That's hilarious! In all my decades of practicing medicine, I've never once heard of such a thing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles turned to Marcus, a sneer spreading across his face, "What do you know? Who are you to spout nonsense in front of a professional? I decide whether this patient lives or dies, not you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus looked at his arrogant expression and chuckled. "Fair enough. But what if the surgery fails?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The challenge in Marcus's words ignited a fire in Charles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though arrogant, Charles was also meticulous. He took the medical film from Laura's file and examined it closely, his eyes scanning every detail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He then looked back at Marcus, explaining, "I've performed thousands of these surgeries, with barely any failures. If this one fails, I'll quit the medical profession for good, and I'll cover all the patient's medical expenses!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The truth was, Charles wasn't making this wager out of the goodness of his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had returned to Solomia mainly for an academic conference. But he had also carved out a little time for this high-profile surgery, which came with a hefty commission worth millions of dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was confident in his skills and believed there was no chance of failure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus clapped his hands. "Deal. Just make sure you don't go back on your word."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mother-daughter cancer cells were notoriously elusive, hidden in ways that medical equipment couldn't easily detect. But Marcus knew what was coming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Charles, still fuming, nodded in agreement. "If I win, you'll bow and apologize publicly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine gaped at Marcus in shock. Her previous encounters with Marcus had left a positive impression on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his behavior today was disappointing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the surgery was going smoothly, and she didn't blame Marcus entirely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe he was just trying to motivate the doctor," she thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine wheeled Laura into the operating room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This guy really thinks he's important, huh? Doubting Mr. Miller? I can't wait to see him eat his words and grovel later!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, he's clearly just a good-for-nothing, trying to act like he owns the place and show off," another chimed in. "Let's see if he still acts so arrogantly later when things don't go his way!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A group of young nurses whispered among themselves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To the nurses, Charles was God.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Few in Solomia's medical community could compare to his expertise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Catherine, you need to be more careful with who you call a friend. People like him, who pretend to know everything, can be dangerous. Stay away from them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas spared a quick, sideways glance at Marcus, his lip curling in disgust.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine wanted to defend Marcus, but Thomas cut her off. "You're too naive, Catherine. You were like this in school, trusting everyone. Your friend almost jeopardized the surgery. Do you have any idea what could have happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine's face turned red, and she was tempted to reveal Marcus's true identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe then Thomas and the others would stop mocking Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she held her tongue, not wanting to invade Marcus's privacy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus checked the time. It was 2 p.m.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that if Charles proceeded with cutting into the liver cancer cells, heavy bleeding would follow, and the surgery would spiral out of control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was ready to step in and save Laura. Turning to Thomas, he said urgently, "Before 2:30, the surgery will cause heavy bleeding. We need a bag of blood that matches Mrs. Wilson's blood type and some hemostatic drugs. Go get them prepared."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas stared at Marcus in shock. A sarcastic smirk curled his lips. "Are you crazy? Now, you're just spouting nonsense! How could there be heavy bleeding during Mr. Miller's surgery? Do you even know what you're saying?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Catherine, your friend might need psychiatric help. I'll arrange for him to be admitted to our hospital's mental health department. If he can't afford it, I'll be generous enough to cover the expenses!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Catherine felt embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know what was going on with Marcus, but his constant interference was starting to feel like sabotage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marcus, please stop," she pleaded, choosing her words carefully so as not to hurt him. "I know you mean well, but we need to trust the doctors. They know what they're doing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her disappointment, Catherine still respected Marcus, treating him like a friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What I'm saying is real. We need that blood and those hemostatic drugs, or it'll be too late."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus glanced at the clock. It was 2:10 p.m. The moment of crisis was approaching fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at the report in his hands. Laura had a rare blood type that was incredibly hard to come by. His mind raced with the implications. Even if he had Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, without the right blood, saving her would be next to impossible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop with the nonsense! If you keep this up, I'll call security to have you removed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas turned icy as he spoke. His patience had worn thin, and it was obvious he could barely stand the sight of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several other young nurses exchanged knowing glances, sharing an assumption that Marcus was probably mentally unstable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's 2:28. Charles will be out any minute. Go and prepare what I need!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus felt their whispers, and strange looks followed him like shadows, but he didn't flinch. With a look of pure urgency in his eyes, he pushed past their judgment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Madman, absolutely a madman! Security! Security! Get this madman out of here! Now! His presence is going to affect the surgery!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thomas was about to call for security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The mockery from the group of young nurses grew louder, their whispers now turning into outright snickers and scoffs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just don't get how the patient's family can even have a friend like that. They've got to be out of their minds!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>The atmosphere was thick with disdain; everyone was convinced that Marcus had lost his mind. Suddenly, the operating room door creaked open. Charles walked out.</span></p><div class="pagination">
