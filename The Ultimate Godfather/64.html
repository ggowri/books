        <h1>Chapter 63 Focused On Marcus</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haley's two chopped-off hands had not yet fully recovered. But he still came to the nightclub for entertainment, surrounded by beautiful women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting next to Haley was Leo Brown, a young man with a stern face, whom Haley kept toasting with a respectful look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Brown, it is the first time that you have come to Solomia. Please forgive me if I didn't entertain you well enough!" With that, Haley drank the liquor in the glass.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Leo just nodded slightly, took a sip of liquor casually, and didn't even look at Haley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beside him, two beauties with hot bodies were posing and making coquettish gestures as if trying to attract his attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo didn't look at them but lit a cigarette, looking calm and having an innate confidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that he would be the focus of attention just sitting there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Brown, don't you like these beauties?" asked Haley, seeing the disdain in Leo's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo, as the youngest son of Ricardo Brown, the head of the Brown family in Kingston, had an extraordinary status and position. Haley dared not offend him in the slightest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, the investment of the Brown family in TreatMed Pharmaceuticals might be canceled again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think any woman can get close to me? Just dismiss them all!" said Leo with an unhappy look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haley's face turned red, and he could only dismiss those prostitutes. By chance, he saw Marcus and Yvonne, and a hint of coldness appeared in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Brown, what do you think of that woman?" asked Haley, raising his finger and pointing at Yvonne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo looked at Yvonne, took a sip of liquor, and smiled appreciatively, "She is not bad and is my type. How about you ask her to come and have a drink with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haley nodded without hesitation. "Mr. Brown, please wait a moment!" With that, he stood up from his seat and walked towards Marcus and Yvonne.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leo's arrival seemed to give Haley a lot of courage, and he said to Yvonne condescendingly, "Mr. Brown asked you to go over and have a drink with him. This is your honor. I hope you'll behave yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Brown family in Kingston was extremely famous throughout Uswad and had ample connections and resources in both business and political circles. With the industries they owned, they could be described as a huge business empire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two people standing behind Leo were retired special forces soldiers, and such people were only qualified to be Leo's bodyguards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yvonne didn't expect to meet Haley here and just felt sick. "I have no obligation to drink with anyone. Get out of here right now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haley sneered, "Yvonne, you'd better behave yourself. Don't forget that your pharmaceutical sales company's business mostly relies on TreatMed Pharmaceuticals. I can bankrupt your family with just one word!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Yvonne changed her expression slightly. She could refuse Haley, but she had to consider her family's pharmaceutical sales company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you scared? Well, come with me right away!" Yvonne's reaction made Haley even more rampant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haley, I didn't expect you to be so despicable. How dare you threaten me with such a despicable method!" Yvonne's face was full of resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what if I threaten you? Come with me now!" With that, Haley wanted to pull Yvonne by force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before Haley touched Yvonne, Marcus slapped him in the face!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Haley was directly slapped away and smashed on a table not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hadn't fully recovered from the beating last time and was slapped by Marcus again. The pain almost made him faint.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You country bumpkin, how dare you to hit me in front of Mr. Brown? Are you courting death?" Haley staggered to his feet from the ground, his body covered in all kinds of dirt, looking miserable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what?" sneered Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Because of the fight here, the music in the nightclub stopped, and the lighting mode was turned on. Then, everyone's eyes were focused on Marcus.</span></p></div>
