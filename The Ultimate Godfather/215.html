Even ordinary Ancient Martial Stage Three experts might not be able to withstand a casual strike from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet, these cyborgs remained unscathed. Their defensive capabilities were incredibly formidable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cyborg with the Gatling gun on its chest unleashed another furious barrage at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Though the boulder was massive, it couldn't withstand such an intense hail of bullets for long.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, it began to crack, at risk of collapsing at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus moved swiftly, pushing the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire to its limits, with flames and thunder rapidly coalescing in his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two forces merged through a unique technique, and he unleashed a frenzied assault on the cyborg!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These cyborgs had formidable offensive and defensive capabilities but lacked mobility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with Marcus' attack, the cyborg intended to dodge but was too slow.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, with a thunderous shock, the Gatling gun exploded under the combined might of </span><span>Thunderfire</span><span> Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Terrifying </span><span>Thunderfire</span><span> Power enveloped the cyborg's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cyborg's body convulsed, attempting to extinguish the </span><span>Thunderfire</span><span> Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the </span><span>Thunderfire</span><span> Power, which not only combined magic but also the power of the two crystals within Marcus' body&mdash;crystals of flame and thunder&mdash;was unstoppable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, the power became even more formidable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the cyborg's body was enveloped entirely, his skin melting at a visible rate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Beneath his skin, mechanical structures began to emerge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus strode forward, seizing the opportunity to unleash a powerful punch at the cyborg's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The punch transformed into claws upon contact, piercing the cyborg's body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cyborg let out a shrill roar and struggled desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus didn't give him a chance, directly extracting the mechanical structures from within!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This damn guy is much stronger than rumored.
