        <h1>Chapter 138 You Won</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd couldn't help but widen their eyes in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward had never dreamed that Marcus would throw him off the stage!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was once the national boxing champion. How could he be defeated?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unwilling to accept the fact, many people even assumed that they had seen it wrong or were hallucinating!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine was also shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of knocking Edward down, Marcus took advantage of the rules of the competition and threw Edward out of the ring to win, which was enough to prove his strength!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine thought secretly that perhaps his fighting skills were not that great, but his wrestling skills were absolutely top-notch!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Murphy actually lost. He just took advantage of the situation. He never dared to fight Mr. Murphy head-on. His victory was unfair!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a roar from the crowd, and many people nodded in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their opinion, once entering the ring, a man must fight with his real strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those who, like Marcus, used the rules of the competition to win were all immoral. A growing number of people expressed dissatisfaction with Edward's defeat, and some even called for another fight.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's enough!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Edward scolded those who were making trouble, glanced at them, and shouted, "No matter how he won, I am the loser. There is no need to find other excuses for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, he gazed at Marcus in the ring again and continued, "You won. The academy will hold an international fighting invitational tournament in seven days. I would like to compete against you again then!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edward's intention was evident. He wanted to regain his reputation by defeating Marcus in the international fighting invitational tournament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus said, "Sorry. I'm not interested."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pivoted around and left the fighting training ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine quickly followed and said apologetically, "Marcus, I'm sorry. I didn't know they would deliberately target you. I hope you don't get angry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took out a handkerchief and wiped the sweat off his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Given Maxine's aloof and cold personality, it was already unusual for her to offer an apology to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waved his hand nonchalantly and said, "It's okay. I am angry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They came to his second-hand Volkswagen Bora.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine continued, "In seven days, our academy will host the international fighting invitational tournament and will send many outstanding students to participate, including me. If you have time, I would like to learn grappling and wrestling skills from you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus narrowed his eyes and said, "That's different from what you said on the plane."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine's face flushed a little, and she said, "If you don't want to teach me, forget it. I just proposed it casually."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, she prepared to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You decide the date, time, and place. Contact me anytime," Marcus said, staring at Maxine's receding figure. He didn't have any bad impression of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was somewhat aloof and cold, yet still kind-hearted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was willing to teach her some skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maxine didn't look back, but with a smile on her pretty face, she walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although their conversation was brief, it caught the attention of Edward, Caleb, and the others, and their hatred for Marcus increased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was driving his second-hand Volkswagen Bora back to the Bayside Villa, but the car automatically stalled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to start the car again, but to no avail, so he had to call a tow truck to take it to a repair shop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The accident depressed him. In recent times, he had already scrapped three cars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It would take several days for this second-hand Volkswagen Bora to be fixed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was really inconvenient for Marcus to travel without a car, so he planned to go to a dealership and buy a new one.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The first brand that came to his mind was Aston Martin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been obsessed with James Bond films since childhood and admired him very much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the films, he drove an Aston Martin sports car, which still impressed Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had always been his dream car, and now, he could buy it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the road where Marcus was on was relatively remote, and no taxi came for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He tried to get a ride-hailing service, but no one picked up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, a Mercedes-Benz car approached from a distance and suddenly came to a stop with its emergency brake very close to Marcus.&#8203;</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because it passed him, the Mercedes-Benz car actually reversed. Then, the car window rolled down, revealing the face of a handsome young man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus recognized him at a glance. It was Thomas, Laura's doctor classmate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the rear windows of the car were lowered. Laura and Laura sat in the back seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the sight of Marcus, Laura smiled, "Mr. Fitzgerald, why are you here?"</span></p></div>
