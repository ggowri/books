A sensation, like an electric shock, spread through her body, radiating to every part of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt an extremely strong sense of excitement in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body was tense, and she felt a wave of pleasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus couldn't bear it anymore, so he pressed Lila under him and kissed her smooth neck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he touched the sensitive parts of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before long, under Marcus' various provocations, Lila completely succumbed to the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She let out high-pitched cries constantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her skin turned flushed, a deep red spreading across it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the red gauze, Marcus quickly tore it apart. The breasts jumped out and trembled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus directly took them into his mouth and constantly stimulated the sensitive parts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Lila emit a series of deeply enticing sounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body kept shaking as if she couldn't bear it at all.</span><span> </span></p></div>
