  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Faust family held significant influence in this region&mdash;which explained why Sebastien had grown into such an insufferable, entitled brat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't even acknowledge her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastien had crossed a line, and for that, there was no mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without another word, Marcus slammed another punch into Sebastien's gut, sending the man gasping for air, his body convulsing in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastien, however, refused to back down. Gritting his teeth, he glared up at Marcus, his face twisted with hatred. "You... you son of a bitch! You think this is over? I'm gonna have my dad cripple you, and after that, I'll take my time with your sister. I'll do it right in front of you! Hell, I'll even throw in that tight little teacher of hers while I'm at it! Just wait, you fucking bastard! You're gonna watch every second of it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even bleeding, Sebastien still had the audacity to keep running his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was almost unbelievable how reckless he was&mdash;a man who still thought he was untouchable, despite his situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But those words?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were the final straw. Marcus' expression darkened instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without hesitation, Marcus drove his foot straight into Sebastien's crotch, putting every ounce of force behind it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastien's body convulsed violently as a strangled, guttural scream tore from his throat. His face lost all color in an instant, his pupils dilated, and his entire body curled inward in sheer agony. Cold sweat poured down his forehead as he gasped for air, his mouth opening and closing, but no real sound coming out beyond shallow, broken breaths.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The realization hit him like a freight train. His manhood was destroyed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blood rapidly spread through the fabric of his pants, the dark stain growing larger by the second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene was horrifying, enough to make even the battered thugs around him instinctively clamp their legs together, their faces twisting in pure terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They shuddered at the thought, their stomachs turning as they watched Sebastien writhing on the ground, his hands clutching at his ruined body in a desperate, futile attempt to undo the damage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was beyond brutal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't just a beating&mdash;this was a death sentence for a man like Sebastien.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yesterday, he had been basking in luxury, indulging in women, acting like he ruled the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And today? Today, he had been reduced to nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Morgana and Nicole, despite knowing that Marcus was capable of violence, were shaken by what they had just witnessed. Neither of them had expected him to go this far, and for a brief moment, they were left speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't just a fight&mdash;it was total annihilation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a man like Sebastien, this fate was worse than death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It meant he would never have children, never experience pleasure again, and would spend the rest of his life as half the person he once was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sebastien's entire world had collapsed in an instant, and it showed on his face. His expression was no longer one of arrogance, but one of absolute, gut-wrenching despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you fucking bastard," he choked out, his voice trembling with pain and rage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You actually did it... you destroyed me! You're dead! Do you hear me? You better not move a fucking inch! I'm calling my dad right now&mdash;he's going to kill you! You're fucking dead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus stood over him, calm and completely unfazed, the corner of his mouth curling into a cold, mocking smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go ahead," he said smoothly. "I'll wait right here. Let's see what your father can do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus knew exactly who Garrick was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man had built Faust Properties into a recognizable name in Solomia's real estate market, but compared to Golden Group, his company was insignificant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In fact, a significant portion of his business depended on Golden Group's supply chain and financial backing. Marcus wasn't the least bit concerned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under normal circumstances, he wouldn't have wasted his time on an entitled brat like Sebastien, but the moment this bastard had set his sights on Nicole, he had crossed a line that could never be forgiven.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were only three people in this world Marcus truly cared about&mdash;his father Richard, his mother Melinda, and his sister Nicole.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyone who dared lay a hand on them had already signed their own death sentence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Marcus did not believe in mercy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the commotion had attracted a growing crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Students passing by had stopped in their tracks, their curiosity piqued by the fight. When they realized who was involved, their expressions shifted from shock to something much darker.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone knew who Sebastien was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With Faust Properties headquartered nearby, he had been roaming this area for years, making himself a well-known figure on campus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As one of the most infamous rich kids in Solomia, there were few students who didn't recognize him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>More importantly, many of the female students had fallen victim to his predatory behavior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of that, most of the students had nothing but disdain for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Sebastien getting beaten so severely by Marcus, many couldn't help but feel a sense of approval.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the moment they remembered the power of the Faust family, their admiration quickly turned into concern.</span></p><div class="pagination">
