  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon witnessing this scene, everyone couldn't help but gasp in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one had expected that the elite bodyguard from Royal Entertainment would make a move on Selena at this moment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think you're doing? How dare you act recklessly in front of me? Who gave you the order?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles helped Selena up and confronted the bodyguard angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The bodyguard's gaze was cold as he looked Miles over before responding, "Of course, it was Mr. Bishop who gave me the order. When has it ever been the business of an outsider to interfere with Royal Entertainment? Moreover, she openly insulted Mr. Fitzgerald. She deserves to be punished!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles' face darkened. He said, "You, as Royal Entertainment's elite bodyguard, are supposed to protect the company's president.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, the position of president at Royal Entertainment has been vacant. How can you be following Evander's orders and still disrespect me, the vice president?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before Miles could finish, Callista, who stood beside Evander, stepped forward. She looked at Miles and said, "Mr. Donovan, I'm formally informing you that Mr. Bishop was promoted to CEO of the company by Mr. Death as of yesterday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As his subordinate, speaking to him this way is disrespectful to a superior. According to Royal Entertainment's rules, Mr. Bishop has the authority to exercise leadership powers, which could result in your demotion or even dismissal! Here's Mr. Death's official appointment letter for you to review."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, Callista handed the appointment letter to one of the bodyguards beside her. The bodyguard took it and handed it to Miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles sneered dismissively, seemingly not believing Callista's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, once he took the letter and examined it carefully. His expression immediately became gloomy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Impossible, this can't be! How could Mr. Death appoint Evander as president?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If anyone should have been appointed, it should have been me. Why is this happening?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles' voice trembled, full of disbelief and resentment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he held immense power at Royal Entertainment, he still lacked the authority that came with being the president.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had been appointed president, he would have gained even more power, and it would have been much easier for him to amass wealth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he thought about this, his frustration became even more apparent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Selena's expression was also grim.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, her power came from Miles, and if he were in a better position, she would have more resources.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Miles had lost the chance to become president, this was a huge setback for her as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, as president, I officially announce that your position as vice president of Royal Entertainment is hereby terminated!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At almost the same time, Evander said to Miles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miles' face turned pale, filled with bitterness as he retorted, "Evander, who do you think you are to fire me? Do you really think just because you've become president, you have the right to do this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll tell you straight, today, you won't be able to fire me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Miles snapped his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, numerous figures rushed into the hall from outside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These people were all in suits, wearing black sunglasses, and each carrying a gun as they entered!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And all their guns were aimed at Evander, Callista, Chloe, and Marcus!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the entire banquet hall was filled with tension and hostility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one expected that this award ceremony would turn into a scene of internal conflict within Royal Entertainment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the power that Miles wielded was far beyond anyone's expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These dozens of people, all armed and well-trained, meant that even the smallest mistake could lead to Evander and his friends' deaths.</span></p><div class="pagination">
