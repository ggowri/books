Everyone was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the sales office manager was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin's wife immediately stepped forward to stop him. "Mr. Burnett, please stop it. If you continue, you will kill my husband!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cried and looked worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to beat him to death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald didn't listen at all but slapped Kevin's wife in the face, knocking her to the ground again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you have to offend Mr. Fitzgerald? Cripple this damn guy's limbs!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Axe Gang members also became angry and gave orders to their men.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although their followers didn't know Marcus, they did everything their leader commanded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly took out the dagger, and with a pop sound, one of Kevin's tendons was cut!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Kevin could even scream, the other man had already cut Kevin's tendons!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately afterward, there was a series of popping sounds, and the remaining tendons in Kevin's hands and feet were completely severed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The blood was all over the ground, which was shocking!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Axe Gang's attacks were very ruthless as they were from the underground world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People couldn't understand. Kevin had brought these people here, but why did he end up with such a miserable fate?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin almost fainted from the pain, but he still asked Donald, "Why do you treat me like this? What did I do wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Kevin in such a miserable state, Donald showed no mercy at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood up straight, walked to Marcus with a respectful look, and said to Kevin and his wife, "Watch out for me. This is Mr. Fitzgerald. Even the head of the Burnett family needs to treat him with respect. You offended him, I'm merciful by not killing you. Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Boom!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words made all of them tremble as if they were struck by lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their minds went blank!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They never expected that this seemingly ordinary young man had such a noble identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who was he to be respected by the Burnett family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone couldn't believe it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the Axe Gang's men were frightened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been hanging around in Kingston for many years, so they naturally knew the importance of the Burnett family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that even the Burnett family was afraid of Marcus. If the Axe Gang could submit to such a person, would they still have to worry about not being able to develop in the future?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Josie looked at Marcus in surprise. She had thought that he must have an extraordinary identity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she never imagined he would be so powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kevin and his wife were completely dumbfounded. They collapsed to the ground powerlessly with empty eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What sin had he committed?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He offended such a big shot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he kept showing off in front of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had used the so-called Burnett family as his backers to show his sense of superiority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unexpectedly, he was nothing compared to Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he thought about it, he thought he was such a clown!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Fitzgerald, I was blind before, and my son deserves to die for offending a big shot like you. Please let me go. My son and I will never dare to do it again. Please forgive us this time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he said that, Donald suddenly fell to his knees in front of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was in his fifties, but he was crying in public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he might be acting, his attitude of admitting mistakes was indeed very sincere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was also the reason why he had such an achievement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep your son under control from now on, and don't let him cause trouble while being a member of the Burnett family," Marcus said to Donald.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Donald admitted his mistake sincerely and was a relative of Maxine, so Marcus naturally had to let him off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Donald saw that Marcus had forgiven him, he immediately kowtowed to express his gratitude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was no longer arrogant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even a direct descendant of the Burnett family was nothing to Marcus, how could Donald do anything?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd was completely stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially those who had laughed at Marcus before were all panicked!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were afraid that Marcus would blame them.</span></p><div class="pagination">
