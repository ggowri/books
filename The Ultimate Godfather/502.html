  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the face of such a terrifying Blade Ray, a cold smile crept across Marcus' lips, his eyes full of sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He casually leaned in one direction and easily dodged one of the strikes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The golden scimitar in his hand slashed wildly through the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the void, a golden streak of light exploded out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, a ninja's head flew off, blood spraying through the air, turning into a rain of crimson droplets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ninja's body dropped stiffly to the ground, lifeless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, another ninja's Blade Ray was already upon him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't flinch. He threw a punch straight out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The terrifying Fist Ray was infused with the powerful Timeless Numinous Energy, surrounded by Thunderfire Power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This combination made the punch unimaginably deadly, crashing into the ninja's body with the force to destroy everything in its path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A thunderous, explosive sound rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Fist Ray collided with the Blade Ray, and the previously razor-sharp Blade Ray shattered instantly, vanishing into nothingness!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' Fist Ray, however, remained undiminished in strength. In the blink of an eye, the second ninja's body shattered apart, turning into a pile of mangled flesh scattered across the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sight stunned the remaining ninjas.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They couldn't have imagined that a young Uswad man would possess such terrifying power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With two strikes, he killed two of their comrades cruelly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was not someone at the Ancient Martial Stage Four level could be capable of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus didn't seem to want to give them any chance to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using Shadow Step, he blurred into countless afterimages and swiftly appeared before another ninja. He grabbed the ninja's throat with one hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual twist, there was a sharp cracking sound as the ninja's throat was crushed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, he quickly summoned Thunderfire Power and retaliated with a Thunderfire Hand Strike, the terrifying energy forming a massive Hand Strike in midair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hand Strike was so powerful it seemed to blot out the sky, hurtling toward the two nearby ninjas with an unstoppable force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two ninjas were filled with horror. They had never seen such a fearsome attack!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They tried to evade but felt an invisible force hold them in place, freezing them where they stood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could only watch helplessly as the monstrous Hand Strike grew larger in their vision, eventually swallowing them whole!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, except for the ninja at the peak of Stage Five, all the other ninjas had been killed on the spot by Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire sequence, though it might sound complicated, had taken less than ten seconds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ninja at the peak of Stage Five looked grim. He had never expected Marcus to possess such power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still, his demeanor remained proud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason was simple. He knew that if it were him, he could easily wipe out these subordinates, too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether they were ninjas, wizards, or warriors, once one reached Stage Five or above, it marked a clear divide.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A Stage Five ninja fighting one below Stage Five was akin to a crushing victory. The disparity in power was huge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thus, in the eyes of the ninja at the peak of Stage Five, Marcus' cultivation should have been at Ancient Martial Stage Five.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had clearly underestimated Marcus' abilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But with his own power, he was still confident he could easily crush Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's your turn now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus' eyes locked onto the ninja at the peak of Stage Five, a cold glint flashing in his gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ninja showed a mocking smile. "I never imagined you were an Ancient Martial Stage Five powerhouse. I admit I underestimated you.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But in front of me, your strength is nothing. You'd better submit and die obediently, and I might let you have an easy death!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing the ninja's arrogant words, Marcus grinned mockingly. "I really don't understand where you get your confidence from. You're about to die, and yet you still don't realize it. How dare you act so cocky?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ninja chuckled darkly, and then his gaze sharpened. His cold pupils gleamed with a sinister light in the dim night. "Since you're refusing to submit, I'll take your life now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, the ninja moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With a casual step, his body turned into a black phantom, appearing right before Marcus. At the same time, the ninja's blade unleashed a terrifying Blade Ray.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a strike that seemed capable of splitting space itself, descending from above Marcus' head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus had no intention of countering. He merely sidestepped, easily evading the blade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ninja's eyes narrowed. He hadn't expected Marcus to dodge his attack so effortlessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, it felt as though Marcus had doubled his speed. It was almost unbelievable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Try taking a few more of my blows!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The ninja gritted his teeth, and again, several Blade Rays rained down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each blade was sharper and faster than the last, each strike more powerful than the one before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, the space in front of Marcus was filled with the deadly blades.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus didn't seem concerned at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He moved effortlessly, weaving through the endless Blade Rays, dodging them with ease. The Blade Rays couldn't even come close to his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This only made the ninja even more furious. He raised his hand and lunged toward Marcus' throat, aiming to grab it.</span></p><div class="pagination">
