  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus didn't seem to have any reason to refuse, so he agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He was used to being a lone wolf, and having a woman around was quite an adjustment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, Pearl was very well-behaved. When he didn't talk to her, she was as quiet as a mouse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Moreover, she was nothing like a spoiled rich girl. She was more like a maid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She took care of Marcus with meticulous attention and was incredibly perceptive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even a glance from Marcus was enough for Pearl to know what he needed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus planned to settle Pearl in Bayside Villa. When he returned to the villa, Pearl could take care of his daily needs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't need Pearl to follow him around when he was out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, Pearl's massage skills were really impressive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>When Marcus returned to Bayside Villa, Diana, and Jane noticed Pearl by his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>They exchanged glances, and Diana said, "Mr. Burnett, didn't you go to the southwest region to collect energy crystals? How did you bring back a beauty? Your game has stepped up a notch!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane chimed in, "Indeed. But I have to say, Mr. Burnett always has a good eye for beauty. This girl is really pretty and has an exotic charm."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus raised an eyebrow, feeling like their comments were a bit sarcastic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>So, he explained, "Her name is Pearl, the daughter of a new subordinate, Cooke. From now on, she'll be taking care of my daily needs. She'll be living in Bayside Villa."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Taking care of your daily needs? Does that mean full-service?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane said with a sly grin, her arms crossed over her chest, which made her ample bosom look even more pronounced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Pearl lowered her head shyly, even appearing a bit timid.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>After all, she was only nineteen, the same age as Natalia, but she had been living in the vast rainforest and had hardly ever been to a big city.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Cooke had hired a private tutor for Pearl, which meant she had hardly ever set foot in a school and didn't know how to interact with people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Ease up, will you?" Marcus warned Jane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jane finally stopped, realizing she had gone too far.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus asked Diana, "I've got the energy crystals. How many guns can you modify in a day?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana replied casually, "About three a day. If your energy crystals are only enough for a few dozen, I can finish modifying them in about ten days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>In Diana's view, Marcus could bring back enough energy crystals for a few dozen guns at best.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She knew energy crystals were expensive. Even with Marcus' assets, he couldn't afford too many.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then take a look at these."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus smiled mysteriously and pulled out all the energy crystals from his Spatial Ring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hundreds of brick-sized energy crystals poured out onto the ground, forming a small mountain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Ripples of energy radiated from them, their brilliance dazzling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even Jane, who knew nothing about energy crystals, was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Burnett, did you get all these energy crystals?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana couldn't believe it and covered her mouth in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Who else could it be?" Marcus replied with a grin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Then you must have spent a fortune. Have you gone broke?" Diana asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn't fathom how Marcus could have acquired so many energy crystals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Would you believe me if I said I didn't spend a dime?" Marcus said with a smirk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Diana was completely thrown off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He didn't spend any money!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She couldn't believe he got so many energy crystals without spending a penny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Diana knew Marcus never lied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She composed herself and continued, "Mr. Burnett, do you know exactly how many guns these energy crystals can modify?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"About sixteen hundred," Marcus said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana was surprised again and picked up an energy crystal. The waves of energy made her body feel warm. "The quality of this energy crystal is exceptional, much better than mine! At this rate, these energy crystals should be enough to modify two thousand guns!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus was pleasantly surprised. "Two thousand? That many?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana nodded. "The higher the quality of the energy crystal, the less quantity is needed. I conservatively estimate these energy crystals can modify two thousand guns."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus finally understood the principle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next, he settled Pearl in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Diana immediately began modifying the guns. With higher-quality energy crystals, she seemed eager to get started.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>[Marcus, have you missed me? What are you up to? Why haven't you contacted me in over ten days?]</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At that moment, Marcus received a message from Melina.</span></p><div class="pagination">
