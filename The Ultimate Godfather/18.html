  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a second, Laird's body turned see-through right in front of Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First the clothes, then - as Marcus pumped more Numinous Energy into his sight - the organs inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he suspected - there was a mechanical device in Laird's body, the source of all those lightning attacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second thought, Marcus darted forward, closing the distance in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He soon found himself face-to-face with Laird, who was still shooting lightning everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laird let out a feral roar, and his sharp claws wrapped in electrical currents swiped at Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Marcus was faster. He sidestepped like it was nothing and, powered by the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, unleashed a devastating punch straight at the device inside Laird.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>BOOM!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The force of the blow penetrated through flesh and bone, seeping deep into Laird's body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The high-tech device couldn't withstand the impact and shattered instantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Electricity surged through Laird's body. His frame convulsed uncontrollably, muscles spasming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mouth gaped open in a primal, guttural howl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A ghost-like creature relying on machinery and pretending to be a wizard?" Marcus sneered, winding up for another hit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How... how did you see the implant? How did you do that?" Laird gasped in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would never know Marcus possessed the power of X-ray vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You wouldn't get it even if I told you. Go to hell!" Marcus snarled, done talking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He launched another attack, determined to end the fight once and for all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let's die together!" Laird screamed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half-mad, his sharp claws lashed out in a desperate grab for Marcus' shoulders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The device inside him wasn't just a lightning conductor - it was a ticking time bomb ready to destroy everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus saw the countdown on the device. There were five seconds before detonation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with his powers, he'd be toast if he didn't move fast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that split second, he whipped out Falcon's Fire Elemental Power Crystal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Gripping it tight, he activated the Timeless Warrior's Grimoire, tapping into its power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instantly, a raging inferno exploded from his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The flames were immensely powerful, scorching only external threats while leaving his own body unharmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They</span><span> swallowed Laird's claws that were buried in Marcus' shoulder in one go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laird howled in agony, yanking back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seizing the opportunity, Marcus bolted away like a flash of lightning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>BOOM!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Marcus reached a safe distance, a massive explosion rocked the area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The explosion lit up the sky, the shockwave flattening everything for miles. Dust and debris went flying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus was thrown off his feet by the shockwave but managed to escape the brunt of the blast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the dust settled, he pulled himself up. With a deep exhale, he relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the previous battle, his body was drenched in blood, every inch of him radiating the aftermath of a brutal clash.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just thinking about Laird's suicide move gave him chills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Without that Fire Attribute Power, I'd be dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I need to get stronger, and fast. This level of power barely kept me alive against these average thugs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">There are worse threats out there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">As long as I'm breathing, they'll keep sending powerful killers after me.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Time is running out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Snapping out of it, he tucked Anthony's equity transfer contract into a secure pocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without a second glance, he set the entire manor ablaze and vanished into the night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>*****</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deep under Weston Land, in a shadowy underground base, a tall man with foreign features stood among soldiers in combat gear, deep in discussion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a crystal ball on the table buzzed and shattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man's blue eyes narrowed to slits, his pupils constricting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a swift motion, he rose to his feet and demanded, "Laird's in Uswad. Who dared kill him? Investigate it. Now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The soldiers snapped to attention, nodding before rushing off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A storm was coming - bigger than anyone had anticipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was 1 AM when Marcus finally pulled up to Bayside Villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Inside, Diana had dozed off on the couch in her black silk nightgown, waiting up for Marcus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Footsteps jolted her awake. Blinking the sleep from her eyes, she sat up to find Marcus standing there, his clothes soaked in blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh! Mr. Fitzgerald, what happened to you?" Diana asked with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Marcus told her everything - Anthony sending Falcon to kill him, storming the manor, taking out the vampire in an explosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Diana's heart raced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Mr. Fitzgerald had changed so much in such a short time!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I'd fought a vampire of Roger before and I knew well about their incredible strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He had handled it alone? And all the bodyguards of Anthony?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">That's amazing! He's far more powerful than I'd ever imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Could Mr. Fitzgerald really be a warrior?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pushing the thought aside, she grabbed the first aid kit and started cleaning his wounds.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does it hurt?" she asked softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She'd been wary of staying with him at first, her initial impression of him was far from favorable. But lately... she found herself increasingly captivated by his extraordinary nature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine," Marcus replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without his shirt, his muscled torso was on full display. </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze lingered on her, stealing glimpses of her plump chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you looking at?" Diana caught his covetous stare.</span></p><div class="pagination">
