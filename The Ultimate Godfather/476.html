  <div class="container"><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus said calmly, "Does a department head not need the director's approval to fire a doctor?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jayden immediately broke out in a cold sweat at those words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Even though he was a highly paid expert hired by Solomia Hospital, he didn't have that kind of authority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He had acted this way earlier because he wanted to dismiss Jade without Carter's knowledge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Carter asked, "Doctors are the backbone of this hospital. Who dares to dismiss one without approval?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus raised his hand and pointed at Jayden. "It's this highly paid expert your hospital hired. He was just boasting about firing my friend!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jayden's face turned ashen as he hurriedly tried to explain, "Mr. Lake, don't listen to his nonsense! I didn't do that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>However, before he could finish, Marcus presented the dismissal letter Jayden had given to Jade earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Carter's expression darkened immediately as he quickly pieced everything together. "Jayden, you've only just started working here, and you already dared to dismiss a doctor without authorization? Do you think you're above the law?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jayden, visibly flustered, tried to explain. "Mr. Lake, it's all a misunderstanding. I thought she was being insubordinate and disrespectful, and I lost my temper. That's the only reason I wanted to fire her!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Insubordinate? You mean she didn't follow the rules you made up yourself?" Marcus sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Marcus laughed coldly and said to Carter, "Jade just successfully performed a major surgery on a patient with severely fractured legs from a car accident. Once the patient recovers, they won't just walk again; they'll be able to run and jump too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Doctors of her caliber are highly sought after by hospitals worldwide, yet this man almost got her fired just now. Isn't that a huge loss for the hospital?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hearing this, Carter grew even angrier. He glared at Jayden and demanded, "Jayden, explain yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jayden, pale-faced, argued, "Mr. Lake, don't just listen to his side of the story. He's deliberately trying to undermine me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Carter chuckled coldly. "Jayden, do you really think someone with Marcus' medical expertise needs to scheme to take you down?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Let me tell you the truth. The person who cured that late-stage cancer patient in our hospital recently was Marcus. A master healer like him is not someone you can belittle so easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Besides, the surgery that Jade performed is something you probably couldn't even handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"So as far as I'm concerned, you're no longer fit to serve as the head of surgery!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"I've decided that Dr. Kelly will take over as the head of surgery!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Upon hearing this, Jayden felt as if the sky had fallen. His head spun as the weight of the situation hit him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Despite his prominence in the field of surgery, being dismissed just a month into his tenure would destroy his reputation and severely hinder his chances of finding work at another hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>At the same time, Jayden, Freya, and the surrounding doctors and nurses were all deeply shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>None of them had ever imagined that the young man before them was the very master healer who had recently cured a late-stage cancer patient!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Although Jayden had only been working there for a month, he had heard of the master healer's reputation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He never thought the healer would be standing right before him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Thinking back to the mocking remarks he had made earlier, he felt his face burn with embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He also finally understood why Jade's surgery had been so successful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>It must have been because of this healer's guidance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jade's eyes sparkled, and a look of excitement appeared on her face. She couldn't believe it&mdash;even in her wildest dreams&mdash;that she had been directly promoted to department head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Before Marcus arrived, she had been constantly harassed and sidelined by Jayden and Freya.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>She had almost been forced out of the department!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But ever since Marcus showed up, everything had taken a dramatic turn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Not only had she successfully completed a nearly impossible surgery, but she had also been promoted to department head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>This position was now equal to her father's rank!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>For Jade, this felt utterly surreal, like she was dreaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>"Mr. Lake, please give me another chance! I won't dare to do this again!" Jayden pleaded desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jayden begged Carter, doing everything he could to salvage what he had lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Carter waved him off. "There's no need to say more. Your problem isn't just about dismissing a doctor without permission. By offending Marcus, you've also offended me. Even if I wanted to keep you, the other higher-ups in the hospital wouldn't agree. Do you understand now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Jayden's face was filled with utter despair.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>His heart was filled with regret. He shouldn't have been so dismissive of others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>He especially shouldn't have targeted Jade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Recognizing his own narrow-mindedness, he realized he had ruined his future in medicine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Freya's face was just as pale. She didn't dare utter a single word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>But Marcus wasn't planning to let her off the hook. He turned to her and said, "According to the bet, you should resign immediately!"</span></p><div class="pagination">
